My PS4 slim has 10.01. Back in May I succesfully performed the JB many times, using PPLoader with the C++ version of PPPwned exe. 

I performed it, let's say, 5/6 times back then, always succesfully at FIRST try, and no problem at all.

Then I stoppeed playing and I resumed few days ago. Because I forgot the exact procedure, at the beginning I was injecting a payloader inside the PPPLoader folder and ofc the JB wouldn't perform (albeit was for 10.01, I dunno what that stage2 does).

Btw after I read and I correct the error, loading the stage2 of 10.01 inside the GoldHEN folder, everythin worked perfectly. I'm able to do everything: play backup, transfer files with Remote package etc.

But I have two problem, the first is a bit alarming:

1) every time I shutdown the console, in NORMAL WAY, so nothing abrupt or strange, the next time I power on it, the ps4 startrs in a sort of safe mode. I have to long press the ON button of the console (from the pad it doesn't work) and the ps4 does a sanity check of the data; then, it starts immediately. I tried also to exit fom the application (games) before shuting down, but is the same. I'm a bit worried because I'm afraid this will damage the console in the long run.

2) the PPPLoader takes 3/4 tries to succesfully JB. This is a bit annoying, since I have to wait like 3-4 minuites, but I don't really care. I just mention because may be related to the frist one and because before it didn't happen.

Both of the problem didn't happen back then in May. I didn't updated the tools in the PC nor in the ps4. Nothing at all.

I mentioned the fact that I loaded the wrong payloder at the beginning because it may be relevant.

Any suggestions?

Thanks."

Edit: figured out how to dump, now how do I rebuild the dumped files into a fpkg

Edit2: I've found a way and turns it a simple matter for fpkg

here's how I did it in case anyone is facing the same issue.

for pkg files (retail games/disc games) you will need to dump the game first and then rebuild it which is a long process and I'm not familiar with the details since Im dealing with fpkgs

for fpkg files in the other hand its a matter of moving files no need to dump anything, I used ftp with a lan cable and fileZilla on my laptop, once you connect them and access the ps4 files you can find:

*  the games in ""user->app"" 
*  the patches in ""user->patch"" 
*  the dlcs in ""user->addcont""

then just drag them to your pc simple as that, this is the [Modded warfare tutorial](https://youtu.be/up7aivGuoW0?si=msG9mj1ulQYXz2cH) where he explains how to use filezilla and ftp in general"

First or second post here. Been reading here and watching MODWARFARE videos. I need some help still to confirm my understanding on what happens when I receive my console in the mail. It's a 9.00 regular, fat PS4 with like 400gb HDD. Here are my questions:

1. The system is already jailbroken, with a local account. Shall I go through Factory Reset and Initialization to really make sure the console is fresh and clean for me to use? If so, what method do you recommend and do are things that I really need to look out for to make sure, I don't mess up? 

2. If I don't initialize, does it make sense to use the MagicDisk USB method if I own one thumb drive to load the exploit and/or pkgs to install? 

3. What about the system accounts? Shall I go through the full tutorial from MW and have a real PSN account with the account activator to make sure I'm set up for the future. Especially saving my save files when moving off of this system? 

4. What kind of internet blocking should I be doing? Just the DNS changes that block the update server? Is it safe to use the wired LAN for that option? 

5. What if I wanna play legal disc games or watch Blu-rays? Do I need to update to the latest FW here to connect to PSN? 

6. Can every use PSN for any reasons on this console? 

7. What's the latest/recommended exploit host do you guys recommend for present day? 

8. Is it worth to actually install a larger HDD on it? Especially a 3.5 SSD? (1 or 2 TB). If so what do I really need to look out for to safely update the drive without updating the system? 

9. What other tips/ideas can you give me to be careful? 

10. What version of Gold HEN should I use in the present day? 


Appreciate all of you! Please do help! Thank you! "

1g5bu0q,Converting Metaphor ReFantazio PC DEMO savegame to PS4,2024-10-16 22:23:19,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/ps4homebrew/comments/1g5bu0q/converting_metaphor_refantazio_pc_demo_savegame/,"Hi, I'm sharing this very simple tutorial to convert your Steam demo savegame to use in the final version game on PS4 using Apollo Save Tool and a jailbroken console. I just discovered the method myself and I've been playing a few days in game beyond what the demo allows and so far so good.  
  
Ok, let's get started:  
  
The first thing we need to do is open the game on PS4 and play until the part where we get to the city, where they'll let us create a manual savegame. It takes 2 or 3 minutes skipping all the cutscenes.  
  
Then we'll go to the PC and look for the path where our Steam savegame is located. In my case it's: C:\\Users\\*myuser*\\AppData\\Roaming\\Sega\\METAPHOR\\Steam\\76561198240213080  
Yours should be something similar. In this folder we will look for the save\_demo0001.SAV file (assuming that you saved the game in slot 1)

Now we have to make a copy of this file and rename it as ""DATA.DAT"" You can't easily rename it from Windows because it will end with the .sav extension. What I did was open the file with the hexadecimal editor HxD (easily found on the internet) and save it from there as a DATA.DAT file.

  
Now that we have our DATA.DAT file we have to move it to our PS4 inside the Apollo Save tool folder. I used FTP but you can do it using a USB stick and a PS4 file explorer  
The folder where you have to copy it is: /data/apollo/17efc840/CUSA47038/ 

You will have to create the CUSA47038 folder and place it inside.  
  
Finally, open the Apollo Save Tool, look for the savegame you created at the beginning of the tutorial and select the option ""Import decrypted save files""  
You should see your newly copied DATA.DAT, accept everything and that's it.

https://preview.redd.it/j7vq4ktb17vd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa1dd44d8a8f160f5a2c5357687bfa91c963b036

  
You should enter the game and see your demo savegame ready to play.  
  
Personal recommendation: Create a new savegame in a new slot and use that one from now on. This way you already have a savegame created 100% from the PS4.

I hope this helps! I did this in a completely improvised way and English is not my native language, sorry if something is not completely understood. I wanted to upload more screenshots but it won't let me add them.

1g3viwx,Alternate NOR pads on NVB-003,2024-10-15 00:47:33,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ps4homebrew/comments/1g3viwx/alternate_nor_pads_on_nvb003/,"EDIT: Yeah since nobody seemed to know, I just did it myself. https://imgur.com/a/RZlitUa
Oh and, as always, firmware ""reverting"" is not for the feint of heart so like, be warned and all that.

Hi there friends. A bit of an odd question for you but, I recently received a ps4 pro from a friend who essentially never used it. I booted it up and discovered that it is on FW 11.02. Having modchipped and done quite a bit with the switch (much to nintendos chagrin) I decided to investigate exploits and homebrew on the ps4.

Skip ahead to what actually matters and I believe that this console very likely has 11.00 in its other firmware slot. I'd love to revert it but as hard as I try, I can't find any details for alternate NOR chip pads on a NVB-003 motherboard. Am I just missing them? Any help would be appreciated. 

Thanks!

Edit: just to clarify what I mean by ""alternate chip pads"", I mean the motherboard traces connected to the chip that can be used instead of having to figure out a method of direct soldering. I'd love to keep the teensy 2.0++ in place to allow updating and reverting in the future. As such, I'd prefer to leave the NOR chip on the board. "

I have been successful in doing so.... on a SATA HDD (the spinning disk the PS4 it came with, hereon in referred to as the HDD) - however, if I use the same files and repeat the process to install to the Internal HDD using a SATA SSD, the PS4 will freeze or crash with the white LED and not boot into Linux at all. This is using the same bzImage, initramfs and psxitarch.tar.xz as on the HDD. The default OrbisOS has also crashed a couple of times (shut off the PS4) and previously when I used the PS4 for games, it used a different SSD but games crashed a lot.

Moreover, if I boot Linux from an external USB drive (whilst Orbis is hosted on the SSD), it works fine, so I'm a bit perplexed at this. Is the PS4 not really fit to work with SATA SSDs? Perhaps the increased data return speed is causing some race conditions within the firmware itself?"

I am running Linux and I want to prepare my Luckfox Mini B (the one you can kinda use like a modchip with the flash memory), but all the instructions are for Windows. I have downloaded the buildroot images and PPPwn-Luckfox from [0x1iii1ii/PPPwn-Luckfox](https://github.com/0x1iii1ii/PPPwn-Luckfox), then according to the [Luckfox Wiki](https://wiki.luckfox.com/Luckfox-Pico/Luckfox-Pico-RV1103/Linux-MacOS-Burn-Image) to [this guide](https://ps4linux.com/forums/d/242-pppwn-internal-install-no-sd-card-for-luckfox-pico-boards) ran `sudo upgrade_tool uf update.img`. Then I followed the rest of the instructions (SSH and stuff) to set up the actual exploit.

However, I would like to know first if I have flashed the Luckfox properly before I go through all the soldering troubles. The buildroot contains many files, but the command only references `update.img`. Are the other files unnecessary, or are they taken care of automatically? The Luckfox Wiki does not give any good instructions.

As an aside, any safety-conscious Linux user should know never to run an untrusted binary you downloaded from the internet, especially not with `sudo`. So what I did was make an Ubuntu bootable Live USB drive, physically unplug all my hard drives, boot from the Ubuntu USB drive (select ""try Ubuntu"" on startup), and then ran the upgrade tool with all the permissions it needs. Finally I turned the machine off and plugged the hard drives back in. (And yes, I did try using a virtual machine first, but that did not work for me, I had to run the upgrade too on actual hardware)"

Out of all my consoles, it seems like ps4 kinda useless to me now. i dont see a point to keep it, hence im posting this thread here

in my case do you think a homebrew switch would work better for me

ps4 is kinda pointless for me now because most of the games are already available in PS5, and they are enhanced.

so even tho most of them are not ""free"" this time, it will be better quality. and i would rather pay and play the enhanced version instead of playing it on 900p 30fps on ps4

there are only a few true ps4 exclusives. for example DriveClub. there is no way for me to play this game in ps5.

however, the number of games like this is, very small.

So I was thinking about selling this ps4 and make better use of this money. What would you do?

i was thinking about switch and vita. But i can only get one device, or just not sell this device. i cant decide.... please help guys.

So many PS4 users depended on the old WebDAV client to download PKG files because it was the only option. EZ Remote Client was available, but version 1.28 didn‚Äôt allow direct URL downloads, so people stuck with the outdated WebDAV client. Now, EZ Remote Client v1.29 is released, offering more reliability, fewer errors, and enhanced features, making it easy to download from URLs without any issues

When adding a link you will see some additional options

https://preview.redd.it/imh83m349ptd1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=86ffe9a37c1058e04434cc7c36ebe68e37cb5f79

**Option 1**: This option is for using debrid services like AllDebrid or RealDebrid. Since we're using direct URLs for PS4 PKG, you don‚Äôt need to enable this feature.

**Option 2**: This enables Remote Package Installation (RPI), allowing the EZ Remote Client to download and install PKG files simultaneously via the web server proxy.

**Option 3**: Enabling Disk Cache can improve the speed of Remote Package Installation (RPI) when the connection is slow, but it disables the ability to resume installations if interrupted.

**Note:** If you're downloading files with RPI enabled, reaching maximum download speed might take some time.

# Advantages of EZ Remote Client :

* **Fewer Errors**: EZ Remote Client is designed to minimize download errors, providing a smoother experience.
* **Real-Time Monitoring**: Unlike the WebDAV client, EZ Remote Client displays real-time download and installation speeds.
* **Remote Package Installation (RPI)**: EZ Remote Client allows simultaneous downloading and installation of PKG files, a feature absent in the old WebDAV client.

Is this normal? Wanting to check as I‚Äôve done separate rips - everything appears to work, but I‚Äôd rather be safe than sorry. 

Edit:
So I‚Äôve run three rips: One with itemzflow Game Manager, one with Karo‚Äôs SGU payload and the last one with hippie68‚Äôs ftpdump. Differences are there prior to generating GP4 or making the final packages.

1 - Itemz has the same files as h68, but sce_sys/license.info and license.dat were left Encrypted.

and now every time i try to update it with any version above 2.04 it shows an error code (CE-30005-8) that prevents the update file from accessing the game 

I deleted the game and reinstalled it and the same issue exists.

also I've downloaded more than one update file does that take more storage? 
Thanks in advance.

Solution: Installing the 5.03 ver should work"

When I finally clicked OK and the XMB opened, GOLDHEN was already running.  Most likely scenario in my head is the OS is fully loaded and doing its thing even on that screen before XMB opens, so PWN can happen.  It'd be so cool if that wasn't what's happening and accidental persistence occurred! "

Hey everyone! üëã

I‚Äôm excited to announce the release of **PKG Analyzer v1.1.0**, a tool designed to help reverse-engineer and mod `.pkg` files with ease. Whether you're a developer looking to tweak package contents or someone interested in custom trophies, this tool has a variety of features that will make your life easier!

### üöÄ **Key Features in v1.1.0:**

- **üîß Fixed Dump Extraction**  
  All files are now extracted correctly during the dump process, no more corrupted data!

- **üîÑ Added Reverse Dump Feature**  
  Now you can apply changes made to data directly back into the `pkg` package, making modifications quicker and more streamlined.

- **üß© Planned Injection Improvements**  
  While no injection exploit has been implemented yet, future updates will likely include the ability to inject DLCs directly into `pkg` files, combining everything into one neat package.

- **üèÜ New Trophy Section**  
  You can extract trophies from `trophy00.trp` files, although some data may be unreadable due to a decryption algorithm issue (fix planned for next release).

- **üèÖ Trophy Creation Tool**  
  Create your own custom trophies! When combined with OpenOrbis, you can generate `.trp` files for use in your projects. Some logic issues still need to be resolved, but this will be addressed in v1.2.0.

- **üìÇ File Browser**  
  A file browser has been added so you don‚Äôt need to dump the entire package‚Äîjust navigate and extract specific files! The browser also comes with:
  - A **Hex Reader** for checking file hexadecimals.
  - A **Text Reader** perfect for reading XML files.
  - A **File Extractor** to easily pull out specific files from the package.

- **üñºÔ∏è Wallpaper Section**  
  Easily view and edit images within the package. The interface is super intuitive, so you can get started right away without a learning curve.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Next Steps & Future Updates**
I‚Äôm already working on version 1.2.0, which will bring more stability and new features, such as improved decryption algorithms for trophy data and further logic fixes in the trophy creation process.

üôå Feel free to drop suggestions, ideas, or bugs you‚Äôve encountered.

There‚Äôs a ‚Äòquick‚Äô method that just requires you to format your drive In FAT32 and copy your distro/kernel files to the root and it‚Äôs supposed to just work. But for me it doesn‚Äôt? When I boot from the USB I get an error telling me my device needs at least 12GB free but I‚Äôm using a 128GB drive so there‚Äôs plenty of room. There is a second set up method but it requires running a live distro of Ubuntu and using Gparted and terminal to manually set everything up. I can do the second method if I must but it‚Äôs a lot of extra work so I‚Äôd prefer to get the quick method working if possible. Anyone know why it‚Äôs not working?

1fqkezl,PS4 keeps crashing during JB,2024-09-27 10:17:46,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ps4homebrew/comments/1fqkezl/ps4_keeps_crashing_during_jb/,"Hi, this is my first post on reddit, I hope I don't break any rules here.

I have an older PS4 (CUH 1116A) now on FW 10.00 that I am trying to JB. I bought a JB-Dongle (P4-Tool, 3rd Generation, Luckfox Pico Plus RV1103 inside) to make things easy and spare me the technical troubles of pppwning via PC. I configured the dongle to my FW, 9.60 at the time, and it crashed. I switched to the alternate method (pppwn\_ipv6) and it crashed. I updated to FW 10.00 and tried again with the same result. Finally I tried connecting to my PC and it crashes at the beginning. I only made it once to KASLR defeat.

I am currently down with the flu, four children are waiting for me to succeed, out of ideas and desperate. Should I update to FW 11? Do I have a shitty PS4? Any suggestion is welcome and thank you guys!

  
UPDATE: I got it to run by doing the following:

First of all follow the FW Update video on¬†[http://www.p4-tool.com/download.html](http://www.p4-tool.com/download.html)¬†but...

instead of using the 2024-8-22 : PPPwn Luckfox Version 1.2.2 and luckfox pico plus image pppwn from their site use¬†[PPPwn-Luckfox-v1.1.1.zip](https://github.com/0x1iii1ii/PPPwn-Luckfox/releases/download/1.2.3_1.1.1/PPPwn-Luckfox-v1.1.1.zip)¬†and¬†[luckfox\_pico\_plus\_image\_minimal\_NAND.zip](https://github.com/0x1iii1ii/PPPwn-Luckfox/releases/download/1.2.3_1.1.1/luckfox_pico_plus_image_minimal_NAND.zip)¬†from¬†[https://github.com/0x1iii1ii/PPPwn-Luckfox/releases](https://github.com/0x1iii1ii/PPPwn-Luckfox/releases)

These are more stable builds without the webserver configuration thing. The process is completely identical but the newer versions are unstable and crash some PS4's like mine.

Out of 10 tries, 9 successfull, 1 crash and 1 crash by shut-down.

Don't update, just do what I did and then configure it to your FW."

1. Enable rest mode on the goldhen settings (Goldhen>settings>enable rest mode)

2. Disable Wi-Fi/Ethernet connection in the internet settings from the ps4 

3. Go to the ps4 rest mode settings and put only ‚Äúkeep apps suspended while on rest mode‚Äù the rest leave disabled

4. Be sure to close every single game and app before turning the rest mode (if you are using jailbroken apps like gamebato, homebrew store etc be sure to manually close them since they don‚Äôt show as ‚Äúplaying‚Äù or ‚Äúusing‚Äù in the home page of the ps4)

5. Now for the important part and the reason why the jailbreak crashed before for me, unplug EVERY SINGLE THING except the power cable from the ps4, this includes USB, Chargers, External HDD/SSD, Ethernet cable AND hdmi (leave the hdmi for last so you can activate the rest mode), after doing that hold the controller menu button and put on rest mode, and before the ps4 turns off unplug the hdmi.

If you do everything correctly you shall be bless with the orange light.

I will note that within itemzflow menu it changes the game info at the top of the screen from fpkg to retail and no idea why, maybe part of the corruption.

I created this account to participate in the discussion about the PS4 Homebrew. I've been around since the 09.00 firmware was released. Now I thought I'd create this thread because it seems so rude to come out of nowhere and just start talking when no one knows who you are. At least on Discord it is the norm to introduce yourself first.



Unfortunately, there are no forums outside of Reddit that I know of. So, let me ask this. Do you think Reddit is generally good? And how does Tech/Homebrew Reddit compare? I'd be really interested and I bet there are a lot of exciting insights here. 



I also hope I haven't broken the circlejerk rule or anything else here. In that case just delete my thread. Greetings!"
1fojx3w,[Wili Wili] How to delete in-app data that is not save data?,2024-09-24 18:41:12,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ps4homebrew/comments/1fojx3w/wili_wili_how_to_delete_inapp_data_that_is_not/,"General question, exemplified by a specific problem of mine:



I have downloaded Wili Wili. Wili Wili is an unofficial Bili Bili app with which you can watch Bili Bili on your PS4. For your interest: Bili Bili is like the Chinese version of YouTube.



Now I can't delete the search history within the app. This function does not seem to exist. And there's more: Wili Wili doesn't save the data as save data like most other apps.



Deleting Save Data does not work because there is no Save Data. Deleting the app does not work either. I did that, then reinstalled it and noticed that the histories were still there even though the app was gone.



And even deleting the entire user does not work, I have also tested this. Like the Netflix login data, this data is cross-user.



So what can I do? I would spontaneously think of initialization as the last resort. But that is of course an overkill and I obviously don't want to do that. Somewhere the data must be saved as files and must be able to be deleted manually. Maybe you can't get as much out of your jailbreak anyway if you don't also use the Explorer?



I would be grateful if you could give me a few tips. Like where I can find the data files, but also general information on the subject. Thank you very much üôè"

I was having trouble with COD MW III, keeps force closing after every mission, so I was looking around what I could do to fix it.

Stumbled upon the option to rebuild database, booted in Safe mode, did exactly that and unfortunately all apps on Homescreen are gone.  
After a bit of further research, this was a stupid thing to do....!

Now i need to rebuild database from Homebrew, but this is not an easy endeavor.

There are 3 solutions that I have tried:  
1. Use Itemzflow -> downloaded that, put on USB and tried to install.  
Got an error application is installed already, but will not start up..

2. Use Apollo Save Tool -> downloaded that, put on USB and installed.  
Opened the app, went to User Toold -> DB rebuild option -> rebuild it and says succes. Unfortunately the apps do not appear back op Homescreen even after full PS4 reboot.

3. Use PS4\_db\_Rebuilder\_EXT -> Download that and apart downloaded Python to run .  
Put PS4 in FTP mode using Goldhen.  
Used Powershell script to rebuild PS4 database over FTP, script says succesfull.  
No apps on homescreen even after reboot.

Hmmmm I think I'm running out of options here.  
Before I go to the next step (reinstalling 9.60 firmware) does anyone have the GOLDEN tip to fixing this??   
  
I will be gratefull ;)"

we did a comparison and the difference was very clear, i needed a better ps4, i was originally just going to get another ps4 but a slim this time and jailbreak it afterward to have my homebrew on it.

Still needing space, I deleted the install from the main XMB Icon delete option.  Whelp, it was gone (and isn't on my external, now, either).

I know I'm missing something, here."

I have a hair-raising problem: I want to get a Minecraft world in the old console edition on my PS5, where of course the PS4 Bedrock edition Release 2019 is now located.



The PS4 save consists of the following folder structure on my USB stick: E:\\PS4\\SAVEDATA\\(a long number)\\CUSA(a number)



There are two files in the CUSA folder. A BIN file and a ""2 file"".



I've tried everything. I was able to successfully upload this save to my PS5 using the stick (I was even shown a preview of the game status in the storage management) but when I open Minecraft and want to sync to old worlds, Minecraft tells me that it can't find an old world.



Converter tools don't work either.



The only way that would work would be to open it on a PS4 and confer to a Bedrock world.



But I don't have a PS4 anymore...



Can someone please help me :(



Thank you."

When you get the WinNFSd.exe app from github, you'll drag and drop that into command prompt it'll execute the string but not until you finish your file path directories. The directory should look as follows.

Command Prompt Directory:



C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\PS4 NFS>WinNFSd.exe -addr 192.168.X.X C:\\hostapp / ""Click-enter""





This is the directory you want to use: 

WinNFSd.exe -addr 192.168.X.X C:\\hostapp /

where you see the IP address, add your own Ip address from your PC. So, go into network settings and click Wi-Fi or ethernet whatever you're using, and click on their properties scroll to the bottom and you'll find ipV4 address. That will be you're address. Once it runs it will let you know the daemon is running and mounting started. The string is currently active and waiting/listening on the address, for the PS4 to connect In Itemflowz. In Itemflowz settings on the PS4 you're going to want to FUSE NFS IP. Type in either the Ip of your PC or use this string with your Ip for specified folder access.



FUSE NFS IP:



nfs://192.168.X.X/app

  


Save settings, then you will want to remember for the next time:

 

Copy only: 

  


WinNFSd.exe -addr 192.168.X.X C:\\hostapp / 

Into a .txt>File save>Label name as: PS4 NFS.bat>change from .txt files to all files>save



if done correctly, you'll have created a terminal file that allows you to auto launch instead of typing the directories every time. Keep in mind that you'll want to remember, to run PS4 NFS.bat first before launching Itemflowz on your PS4, or your daemon will crash. This is if the settings had been saved and PS4 app launches first."

1flcqf3,"Complete Guide to Using PS4 Cheater on Firmware 11.00
",2024-09-20 14:00:51,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/ps4homebrew/comments/1flcqf3/complete_guide_to_using_ps4_cheater_on_firmware/,"**Guide by TRUSTNOONE**

This guide will explain how to set up PS4 Cheater Neo to connect your PC to your PS4 on firmware 11.00. Follow each step carefully to avoid errors.

# Requirements:

* A PS4 with firmware **11.00** and **jailbroken**.
* A PC with Windows.
* Network connection between PS4 and PC (same local network).
* The game should be running on the PS4.
* Internet access to download the necessary files.

# Step 1: Download PS4 Cheater Neo

1. Go to GitHub and download the latest version of PS4 Cheater Neo. You can find version [1.0.3.1](http://1.0.3.1) at the following link: [**https://github.com/avan06/PS4CheaterNeo/releases/tag/1.0.3.1**](https://github.com/avan06/PS4CheaterNeo/releases/tag/1.0.3.1)
2. Click on the ""PS4CheaterNeo.zip"" link to download the ZIP archive.

# Step 2: Extract PS4 Cheater Neo

1. Once the ZIP archive is downloaded, extract it into a folder on your PC.
2. Rename the extracted folder to ‚Äú**ps4cheaterneo**‚Äù to keep everything organized.

# Step 3: Create the Payloads Folder

1. Inside the ‚Äúps4 cheater neo‚Äù folder, create a new folder named ‚Äú**payloads**‚Äù.

# Step 4: Download PS4Debug

1. Download the `ps4debug_v1.1.16.bin` file from GitHub, which is necessary for PS4 Cheater Neo to work. You can find it here: [**https://github.com/GoldHEN/ps4debug/releases/tag/v1.1.16**](https://github.com/GoldHEN/ps4debug/releases/tag/v1.1.16)
2. Click on ‚Äúps4debug\_v1.1.16.bin‚Äù to download the file.

# Step 5: Prepare the PS4Debug File

1. After downloading the `ps4debug_v1.1.16.bin` file, move it into the ‚Äúpayloads‚Äù folder you created in Step 3.
2. Rename the downloaded file to `ps4debug.bin`. This step is crucial for the program to recognize the file.

# Step 6: Launch PS4 Cheater Neo on Your PC

1. In the ‚Äúps4 cheater neo‚Äù folder, double-click on `PS4CheaterNeo.exe` to start the program.
2. Make sure your PS4 is on, with the game running and connected to the same network as your PC.

# Step 7: Enter Connection Details

1. In the PS4 Cheater Neo program, enter your PS4‚Äôs IP address.
   * **How to find your PS4‚Äôs IP address:** Go to Settings on your PS4 ‚Üí Network ‚Üí View Connection Status. There, you will find the IP address.
2. Enter the port **9090**, which is the default port used by PS4 Cheater Neo.

# Step 8: Send the Payloads

1. After entering the IP and port, click the ‚ÄúSend Payloads‚Äù button.
2. If everything is set up correctly, you will see a success message indicating that the connection has been established.

# Step 9: Verify Functionality

1. Once the payload is sent, the program should be able to interact with the game on your PS4.
2. Check that the cheats work as expected, and be cautious not to use functions that could crash or cause issues with the game.

# Common Troubleshooting:

* **Connection error:** Make sure PS4 and PC are on the same network and the IP address entered is correct.
* **Payload not sent:** Ensure the file is correctly renamed to `ps4debug.bin`.
* **Game not responding to cheats:** Verify that the game is compatible with PS4 Cheater Neo and that the values are up to date.

Following these detailed steps should enable you to use PS4 Cheater Neo smoothly. If you encounter further issues, double-check each step to ensure nothing was missed!"

It just better to stay forever at 9.60 and wait for any update on the NoBD toolkit?

Basically, I have a PS4 SLIM with FW 9.0 and I literally use it just for playing games, not installing Linux or emulators or some homebrew apps. I don't play online, just co-op. I would buy the JB TOOL because I don't want to bother with previous USB method anymore. I'm talking about the JB TOOLS that are sold on AliExpress.

Questions:
1. How reliable are JB TOOL kits for FW 9.0?
2. Can it brick my console?
3. Do I really need to update to FW 11.0 because I would like to stay on lower firmware?
4. Will this new PPPwn method cause any trouble because of previous USB method?
5. Will it throw kernel errors, and why it is happening (I see it happens to some)?
6. How reliable is it considering future JB methods?
7. Does it really takes too long to JB?
8. Which tool is best to buy?
9. Can you really switch on kit between 9.0/11.0?

Are there other things I should be concerned?

I've watched some tutorials on yt, but no one used tool on FW9.0, which is why I'm curious.

I would also like to hear your opinion.

Sorry for the long post but better be safe than sorry, and I hope you understand me because I'm not so technical.

Thank you."

I think it's linked to the framerate (higher framerate = sped up gameplay), but I'm not sure. I haven't been able to search this issue very easily, but I noticed that my character seems to run way faster in a secluded alley, where the game reaches 50 fps (see clip 1 below).

The game is still playable, but it's extremely annoying. I have decreased time to react to enemy attacks and QTE prompts (see clip 2), and I really don't want to facetank every boss's super move, especially in mid-late game.

I'm running GoldHen 11.00 and playing Lost Judgment CUSA28183 v01.11.

These are things I've done that did not help:

1. close and launch software again
2. restart PS4 and run GoldHen again
3. activate 60fps patch on PS4 Cheats Manager

I have not reinstalled the game/patches yet because I don't have the pkg and patch files anymore. Any help or advice would be appreciated. I was really looking forward to playing this game (one of my last RGG games)

PS4 clips:

[Running in circles](https://imgur.com/tQsaRnR) (very fast footsteps at 50 fps, then\~30ish fps at the end)

[DLC first chase](https://imgur.com/hf8WfHt) (varied fps, very fast footsteps and QTE prompts at some points)

  
**Edit in the case that some poor lad has this problem in the future:**

**1) Open GoldHen settings by going all the way to the left on the home screen**

**2) UNCHECK the apply patches setting**

**This was the only thing that fixed my issue. Reinstalling did nothing, using a different region's pkg did nothing, deactivating the 60 fps patch did nothing, nor did uninstalling the patching program that I had originally used.** "

I'm hoping someone can help me out with a weird issue I'm having on my jailbroken PS4 running 9.00 firmware. Everything was working perfectly fine until recently. Now, whenever I launch any game, it loads up just fine, but once I'm in the game, I can't tap on anything to play or access the menus.

The strange part is, the only button that seems to work is the PS button, which takes me back to the homepage. All other buttons don't respond when I'm in the game.

Has anyone experienced this issue before? Any ideas on how to fix this? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!"

There's a few BDP-025 boards on Aliexpress, that the seller claims they're working, but changing the Renesas will be enough?.

  
I'll try changing the cables for my board and check if this could possibly be the issue, since its not turning on at all, beeping or taking discs.

Starting at 9:30 this morning it didn't finish until 10:00 pm tonight. 

I just wanna know is there anything or any way I can make this go faster? I've tried remote package installer but it says it'll take 80 minutes for 5 gb
Is there a way I can make that go faster also?

I'm on the 11'00 JB

Thanks in advance üòÅ

Edit: thanks for the help everyone one thing I should clear up though is that I'm using an external hard drive that I thought would be fast enough I used to run rdr2 on it. But thanks for the suggestions I will probably buy an SSD most likely the: Western Digital 1TB WD Blue SA510 SATA SSD, Internal 2.5‚Äù/7mm Cased Solid State Drive - WDS100T3B0A

If someones knows a better and would let me know thatd be much appreciated thank you üòÅ

Luckfox only needs Power (0,5w max) and on PS4 it automatically powers up. So i was thinking to use Aux Port for power but couldnt find any spare connectors available. Instead i ordered now USD 2.75$ USB 3.0 Y-cable with 1 male and 2 female ports (1 power only USB 2.0 + 1 power+data USB 3.0). Cable not here yet, but i think it should work, keeping 2 spare ports available on PS4.

1fdaqk6,Putting out the idea to help expand the homebrew PS4 creator scene?,2024-09-10 05:44:24,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ps4homebrew/comments/1fdaqk6/putting_out_the_idea_to_help_expand_the_homebrew/,"So initially, thank you to everyone who has helped me along my journey and I value the knowledge I have now when it comes to a lot of things surrounding the PS4 and homebrew. However, I think that the doors to new creators could potentially be wider if some areas were expanded on for homebrew development. 

I personally enjoy porting things to PS4 that were not intended so inputs can be a huge pain. Some shaders get really whacked with starting points being top or bottom so can pose issues for people. 

Another area would be prx files or working with dlls. I recall something from RetroGamer or EchoStretch maybe that provided some direction. I can dig it up if anyone is curious. I don't have a complete ""how-to"" on it still but had enough to fumble my way through things eventually. 

With porting being my own main interest, I guess I have always found a need to be able to understand what some dll files are doing or how to use them within a PS4 project. Or building my own that can run natively. Things might be different now but at the time for myself, it was a large gap that I wished either to have a sort of mentor or a guide to help me. Not something in crayons but for someone who can come into things with a dev environment already set up and has an understanding of terminology and whatnot. 

I just think that if the homebrew sort of like ""gateway"" could have a bit more of a sort of welcome package, the scene would be able to have more people with the confidence that they will be able to produce something that doesn't suck. And in turn, maybe get curious creators attracted to the platform for their canvas. 

I know that I found it quite difficult when I made my first game and by supporting new creators we hopefully can only end up helping all of us in the end as a whole. 

I am by no means an expert on anything and don't get paid for anything related to this type of stuff. I see the art being lost and maybe by further building the homebrew community it could create a larger margin to allow people to not have to care about the failing AAA titles and have a plethora of unique titles to play within the HB scene by like-minded creators.  

If anyone else is supportive of something along these lines, let me know. I am willing to start taking some initial steps for things or whatever. I guess this is just something I thought I would toss out there and see where other people rest their thoughts with it. Maybe there already is something and I am just the last to know about it haha. 

Happy to share links to my work as well. Currently am trying to finish Mortal Kombat Returns for PS4."

Release Note
I think it's necessary, so I'll do a proper release for both versions 1.2.3 & 1.1.1

Reduce the problem where the PS4 does not shut down properly
Reduce crash when trying to jailbreak or shutdown
Improve Stability
Add stage2 for FW 10.50, 10.70, 10.71
Note on custom buildroot image:
For v1.1.1 please use _image_minimal_.zip
For v1.2.3 please use _image_web_.zip
Note on PPPwn-Luckfox version:
PPPwn-Luckfox v1.1.1 : No Web Server
PPPwn-Luckfox v1.2.3 : With Web Server
This is not 100% fixed the issue as it still happened at some point if the jailbreak took too long. There's a chance of a bug on GoldHEN or the PPPwn.

1fceb2c,[Tutorial] How to Jailbreak Your PS4 with a Raspberry Pi and Set Up Chiaki for Remote Play,2024-09-09 01:53:51,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/ps4homebrew/comments/1fceb2c/tutorial_how_to_jailbreak_your_ps4_with_a/,"In this tutorial, we will guide you through configuring your PS4 jailbreak using a Raspberry Pi and enabling remote play with Chiaki. The process will cover setting up GoldHEN, configuring Apollo Save Tool, and routing the network for Chiaki remote play.

# 1. Jailbreaking the PS4 Using Raspberry Pi

To jailbreak your PS4 with a Raspberry Pi, follow the steps outlined in the video tutorial by **Modded Warfare** [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvivDdRirLA). Keep in mind that the install commands used in the video may slightly differ from the current ones on the GitHub repository.

# 2. Installing the Raspberry Pi Jailbreak Setup

Use the commands from the **stooged GitHub repository** for the Raspberry Pi setup:

* Visit [stooged's GitHub PI-Pwn](https://github.com/stooged/PI-Pwn).
* Run the necessary install commands from the repository.

During the setup, you'll be prompted to enable internet access for the console. **Select ""Yes""** when asked to enable internet access, as this is required for later steps.

# 3. Enabling GoldHEN and Installing Apollo Save Tool

Once the jailbreak is complete and GoldHEN is enabled on your PS4, follow these steps:

* Download and install **Apollo Save Tool** from this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6zr0B94b4).
* Enable PSN account access as shown in the video.
* Take note of your **PSN account ID**; we will use it later for configuring Chiaki.

# 4. Converting PSN Account ID to Base64

After obtaining your PSN account ID, head over to this **Python3 script on Trinket.io**: [PSN Account ID to Base64 Converter](https://trinket.io/python3/ba2ff26973).

* Enter your PSN account ID into the script to convert it into Base64 format.
* **Save this Base64 ID**, as we will need it during the Chiaki setup.

# 5. Configuring Raspberry Pi as a Router for GoldHEN

Once GoldHEN is enabled, your Raspberry Pi will act as a router for the PS4, providing internet access through **PPPoE** and creating a separate subnet from your main router.

To allow communication between your router and PS4, follow these steps:

1. **Add a Static Route on Your Main Router**:
   * Access your router‚Äôs settings (this can vary depending on the brand, so refer to your router‚Äôs documentation).
   * Add a static route to the PS4's IP address. This ensures that devices connected to your main network can communicate with your PS4, which is on the Raspberry Pi's subnet.

# 6. Using Chiaki for Remote Play

After adding the static route and ensuring you can **ping the PS4's IP address**, it‚Äôs time to set up **Chiaki** for remote play:

1. **Run Chiaki** on your computer.
2. Select the **Manual Add** option and enter the following details:
   * The **IP address** of your PS4 (from the Raspberry Pi‚Äôs subnet).
   * The **Base64 PSN Account ID** that you saved earlier.
3. Enter the **pairing code** for remote play. You can find this on your PS4 under **Settings > Remote Play > Pairing Code**.

If the connection fails:

* Disable Remote Play on your PS4.
* Reboot the PS4, wait for GoldHEN to enable, and then re-enable Remote Play.
* Retry using Chiaki with the same details.

By following these steps, you'll be able to successfully jailbreak your PS4, configure the Raspberry Pi to act as a router, and enjoy remote play using Chiaki."

1. when i download games do i need to download the updates as well or can i save myself some storage by not downloading them and have it still work with game + dlc only?

  
2. are the cheats menu only if games have cheat codes in them or is it more than that and i can download cheats for games created by people?

  
3. can i install games on multiple hdd connected via usb on the ps4 or does it only allow internal storage installing?

  
4. what else can i do besides free games and emulators?

5. how can i turn on the ftp on the ps4 does it need wifi or do i connect it to the router instead and itll open a port and i can ftp to it? will it risk updating my ps4 even after i disabled auto downloads? just worried itll auto sign me into the network on my ps4."

Thanks in advance for any help.

I installed a Luckfox Pico Mini following MODDED WARFARE's tutorial (this is the 3rd PS4, but the first ""fat"" one, as the two others were PRO and worked flawlessly).

I've tried 15 times but I just got one successful JB. The other 14 attempts were ""panic mode"" shutdowns. On the PRO models, the shutdowns seldomly happen so I suppose this is an issue with ""fat"" models.

I've tried [0x1iii1ii](https://github.com/0x1iii1ii) and [harsha-0110](https://github.com/harsha-0110) PPPwn-Luckfox, with the same results.

WebUI works fine.

Maybe I'm not using the right pads on the ethernet port?

Yellow => TX+ | Green => TX- | Blue => RX+ | Red => RX-

Is there anything that I can do about it?

PPPwn shows scaning for corruped object failed error and then continues to try again and again until my ps4 crashes. What I'm doing wrong? Do I need to reset my os4 to factory settings? "

Changelog


Changelog:

Separated config and bin directories
Migrate run script to service so it doesn't lock other inits while it runs
Minimized number of install script variables
Moved config to 'ini' style. Shell handles these way easier than json and on the PHP side, only small changes where needed. Install script will handle migration if needed.
Uninstall script to revert the changes and bring the board back to stock.
Separated web_monitor script so we can easily control it via main service
Cleaner process control (kill and spawn)
Mo more script-embedded configs. Defaults are always present
All necessary binaries and stage directories are symlinked
Added connection to PPPoE server before running exploit for higher chance of success
Added Buildroot Installation MacOS Guide (NAND only).

1fa9xec,If you use DirectPackageInstaller in Android read this,2024-09-06 08:10:37,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/ps4homebrew/comments/1fa9xec/if_you_use_directpackageinstaller_in_android_read/,"Hi, I'm the developer of DirectPackageInstaller and I came here to notify the users that you may notice that the DPI for Android will sudden close it, to solve this problem you will need to uninstall and download the lastest version manually.

If you want know what is happening basically the current DPI depends of the .NET 6 framework and this framework is near of End Of Life in favor of the .NET 8.

Some projects that DPI depends on like Avalonia and Xamarin in the Android are already becamming tricky to works with the .NET 6 and making the maintence complex for me.

Upgrade the runtime is a pain because means the users can't auto update and will face a trouble to download the new runtime, this new version for Desktop is made for auto-detect the installed runtimes and request you to install the correct Runtime when I upgrade it to .NET 8.

In android the reason of crash is simple: Apk Signature mismatch

Since I'm facing trouble with the android support for .NET 6, instead do my usual local build I let the Github Actions generate this lastest build, this mean the current version is not using the same apk signature and therefore can't be automatically upgrade due the android security policy.

My apologies to the trouble but I'm mad as well with the things just being broken due incompatibility with newer softwares, made me think about how .net can be trustable in long-term if they are doing breaking changes so frequently."

My problem is that after I jailbroke my PS4 and tried to install games on it, I encountered a major issue. When I transfer the games to a USB HDD after downloading and verifying them, I face difficulties installing large-sized games. The installation process suddenly stops and crashes. When I check the menu, I see that the game hasn't fully installed and has an error icon next to it ( X icon ). However, I don't face this issue with smaller games, and surprisingly, I was able to install GTA V, which is a large game, without any problems. It's the only large game that installed successfully. I need help to resolve this issue.

My idea is that there's an app or function any existing app such as ps4 xplorer that allows you to simply merge (maybe even just concatenate two parts' contents in bytes, nothing fancy) pkgs so that you could transfer them on ps4 one by one, merge and install via goldhen debug menu from internal hdd. 

I know it's easier to just buy bigger hard drive but stores in my city are closed after 19:00 lol I want to do play now and not go and buy disk that I will have to format for exfat and only use for transferring games.

Anyway, I'm sure it isn't that hard and I can probably go ahead and do it in unity but I doubt it's easy for apps to access playstation's filesystem, I saw xplorer does some black magic with root priveledges to lookup files on your ps4, maybe someone in comments can point me to right direction or maybe there is existing functionality

My router is somehow so slow it takes 4 hours to transfer 32 gb which is like 5 mb/s against 60-70 mb/s for hard drives"

I'm currently trying to make Fedora 38 work but I have a ton of problems, starting for Linux only booting half of the times and the other half just crashing the console, I have a PS4 Pro on 10.01 and the process to jailbreak is quite long.

Half of the times where Linux does booth, I get a bug where bluetooth and wifi drivers don't work, forcing me to connect the controller instead of using it wireless.

Assuming that Linux booths, I still have to connect a keyboard every time so I can press a combination of keys to reset the video output and get out of a black screen. 

besides the bugs, Linux as an OS is EXTREMELY hard to use, I didn't find any answers online on how to remove the login password so I can go straight to playing without the need of a keyboard.

I'm really mostly interested in dumping games to eventually emulate them. I successfully dumped my disk copy of Bloodborne and it's DLC using Itemzflow 1.06, and then attempted to do the same with my PSN copy Ratchet and Clank 2016 (CUSA1047, patch 1.09). Unfortunately, after initiating the dump, it stayed on the very first file and the progress bar never gets above 0%, even after leaving it for multiple hours (edit, it completed one or two very small files, and the trophies in about 5 seconds, then get stuck on a file called `asset_archive/a00s007.fr`)

Am I missing something compatibility wise, or is this just a very large file that is going to take a long time to extract? I've tried to look up whether PSN games require different steps to dump, if only specific patches will work, etc, but any info is incredibly vague or assumes I'm on a different firmware. I appreciate any help."

I started messing around with it and it worked!!! I got it to jailbreak on first try taking no more than 20 seconds lmao
I couldn't believe me eyes so i had to restart the ps4 and rejailbreak to see if it was mere luck but no; I think i figured it out üòÄüòÄ
So basically I can't pinpoint exactly what i did since i did few things that ill state below:

- create a new user on your ps4 and run the jailbreak on it then switch back to the old one
-when setting up A lan connection and trying to fill up the PPPoE credentials, use 1 letter in both the username and password ( doing so you'll l notice that not only will the loader take less tries but also the whole process will become faster and you can notice that from tthe heap grooming stage )
- if you use a laptop make sure its plugged into the charger
- use a shorter LAN cable and make sure there are no dents in it.

Edit : ive run around 16 tests to be sure, it worked each time"

First, it says that the best way download is by using Real Debrid? I have a real debrid account and I‚Äôve plugged the API key into the program but I have no idea what to do from there. I‚Äôve tried taking a 1 filcher link and plugging it into RD and clicking on unrestricted my link but when I plug the resulting decrypted URL into direct pkg installer I just get an error. So does anybody know how a RD API is supposed to be useful? And also is it not possible to download multi-part pkg files or RAR files using this program? It seems to handle links to actual pkg files fine but that‚Äôs it. I ask because of the two sites I use only one has links to plain pkg files and it offers way less than the other site which has all its downloads split into parts that are RAR archives."

I've done my best to research this, and seen mentions of ""backports"", but these guides seem to all be written from a piracy-based perspective, assuming that I already have files on my computer (to patch?).  But I don't.

So what's the best way to start with a 5.05 PS4 and a legitimate disc game that wants a newer firmware, yet play it without altering the firmware?  Ideally it would never involve connecting the PS4 to the internet."

Now with the third PS4 that i've been trying to jailbreak since yesterday and it stills shuts down everytime i launch the jailbreak(i get the ""cannot connect to network message"" from 3 to 7 times max and then the PS4 shuts down) i'm still trying with it but didn't try the Initialization of the console yet because i have files and games there that i don't wanna lose in addition i can't even confirm that that method helps with anything yet.

I'm running out of ideas guys, what's causing this problem? funny thing as i already mentioned all PS4s are the same model 2216B. Will there ever be a fix for this?"

I can't access to weird accessories for my jailbreak so I'm going to go with a long ethernet cable, about 6 to 8 meters, is there any difference between using ethernet 5, 5c, 6, 6c at the speed and compatibility from the activation of hen with my Ps4 ?

I have a ps4 slim 1TB CUH-2216b, I think this version was one of the ""cursed"" ones but the truth is that the hen works on the 2nd or 1st try with a short cable.

Is a cable slower, gives more errors or is not compatible? Those are my doubts.

What I did was to first download the files to my phone. Then use ES file explorer to connect to my PS4 through FTP and copy the files from my phone to a temp directory on the PS4 HDD.

So.... Should I slow down? What happens to my body when I burn mostly carbs instead of fat? What should I do differently to get a higher *but not too high* heart rate so I burn the fat?

But I'm pretty new to sport as I have very low stamina but I would like to go back to it. However I saw for each of those videos they recommend doing them 3 to 4 times a week, but since there is 3 videos for each ""concerns"" should I do all of them 3 to 4 times a week ? or should I focus on one of them for a week and rotate to the next video ?

I'm afraid to be too optimistic, do all of them a couple of times a week and next get tired after less than a month.

Do you have any advices on how I could do ?"

I'm looking to buy a stationary bike for home use and have done some research, but I'm hoping to get some firsthand advice and experiences from this community. So far, I've narrowed it down to a few options:

* Schwinn IC4 ‚Äì Seems like it offers good value and has solid reviews. I like that it has Bluetooth connectivity, so I can sync with various fitness apps.
* Bowflex C6 ‚Äì I‚Äôve read that this one is similar to the IC4 and also pairs well with fitness apps, but I‚Äôd love to know how people feel about its durability.
* Peloton Bike ‚Äì The Peloton is tempting, but I‚Äôm not sure if the subscription cost is worth it. Are the classes as good as they say?
* Spinning Aero Bike ‚Äì I like that this one seems straightforward and sturdy, but I'm not sure about the experience compared to the other models.

If anyone owns any of these or has other recommendations, I'd really appreciate your insights. Thanks in advance for helping me find the best option for a home workout!"

I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4. 

I started strength training in maybe march or April and I‚Äôve been consistent 3-5 days a week heavy resistance but I‚Äôve been eating in a calorie deficit for this entire time and I have gained a lot of muscle and lost a lot of fat- I think I recomped pretty well. 

But my weight hasn‚Äôt changed in quite a while and I haven‚Äôt noticed a very big change in how much weight I can push or pull or muscle growth. I think I was in a deficit for FAR too long, so I‚Äôve started to eat in a surplus to try and put on some muscle and try to bump up my metabolism by doing so.

Does this sound like a logical path to take? I wanted to get down to around 15-18% body fat before trying to ‚Äúbulk‚Äù but I feel like I‚Äôve grown stagnant in my progress whether it‚Äôs losing or gaining muscle. I think I‚Äôm sitting around 20-22% if I had to guess. 

And please go easy on me, this is honestly the first time I‚Äôve ever strength trained outside of high school 20 years ago, and I‚Äôm still learning A LOT as I I on. "

15 hand gripps on both hands while bending knees.  
15 push ups  
35 finger workout with rubber-finger-stretchers on both hands while bending knees.  
10 push ups  
Then some hand and arm workouts from a fitness intructor on Youtube (4 workouts).  
One break for 2 minutes after the second push-ups.  
Then i take 5-6 hour break before doing this all over again

My hands hurt a bit lately, my arms less so.

I've just started exercising with only my bodyweight (push up, squats, etc) and I've kinda zeroed in on exercising every other day, and rest in between.

I am :

- male
- 33yo
- about 4-5kg overweight
- got a physical job, but never exercised
- smoked half my life, but quit 3y ago

Rutine :

- 10 min warm up
- 20 min non stop exercise, full body training
- 10 min stretching
- Once a week I walk 1 hour, maybe 1,5.

I want to start slow, and continuesly increase the workload. Going to buy 2x 5-10kg dumbbells and work towards a 3x17 rep rutine with the dumbbell on top of the full body workout when I feel that I'm able to do so. Maybe in 3 weeks.

Does this sound like it can produce results with consistent effort, or should I let my body rest more?

I got food and sleep locked down, so don't worry about that.

Thanks for reading."

Exercising  in water helps you move more easily than you could on land, the warm water is good for your muscles and the water resistance can help lose weight or inches.

I think this would be a great choice for people with mobility issues, who don't like being in a typical gym or who aren't sure where to start. 

I do aqua zumba, which gets you moving in a fun way, but I've also done some other classes that are just exercises and I find it more fun and I don't feel discouraged doing it.

10/10 would recommend and I wish it was more encouraged."

1g6sjjv,A messy post looking for a fitness app that best suits fam and I... help?,2024-10-18 20:57:06,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Exercise/comments/1g6sjjv/a_messy_post_looking_for_a_fitness_app_that_best/,"I apologize in advance to those that read this whole weird list/rant or whatever it is. As I said, I'm looking for the best fitness app for me and my family. I have gone through and tried about 30 different iPhone fitness apps and can give you an idea of what I'm looking for‚Ä¶ definitely wanted to hear from my Reddit fam... the main things are:
1. I want it to be able to give me a routine to follow as far as what exercises to do for what workouts. This should include the name of the exercise, a gif or little movies of someone doing the exercise, number of sets, number of reps and (ideally) weights for each weight-exercise. Most do not have the weight already loaded for you based on measurements or performance but would be great to have somewhere to start.
2. The routine should change based on how I'm doing on the exercises, my stats, maybe muscle-confusion and the like...
3. I'd like my mother and father to be able to use it as well. Only issue might be that my father went blind and doesn't have a smart phone (but does have a Fitbit that sends his data to me if that helps) and my mother has an android. Maybe if we could find an app that accepts different profiles, each having different measurements and goals, etc.
4. Definitely need to be able to enter the equipment we do have to tailor our workouts to accommodate our gear as it sees beneficial.we have a couple adjustable benches, a couple sets of dumbbells, barbell and weight, jump rope, rower, a lot of boxing equipment, etc.
5. I also have an Apple Watch (which I insist be compatible with the app) and iPad while my parents have fitbits (which would be nice to be compatible but not necessary) and an android.
6. I know that at least one app lets you enter injuries and disabilities to cater to those that have issues with certain exercises... that'd be nice. 

I guess mainly I need an exercise app that will be good for beginners and intermediates and spell it all out for me after allowing me to customize by putting in personal measurements and equipment I have at home that can help... what exercises in what workouts on what days based on information like measurements, experience, performance, equipment available, injuries, etc.) in each users profiles (if they allow multiple profiles)... giving me every detail necessary (sets, reps, weight?, etc.) while custom designing workouts to each user and their specific goals and abilities... I want it to work on all my apple devices and hope to see it work on my parents fitbits or at least my mothers android phone. So far, the favorites I think I can remember from the many, many I've tried seem to be SmartGym, Fitbod and Dr. Muscle if I remember correctly. I am not really interested in videos of the workouts as much as a checklist or list of some sort with illustrations of each exercise that I can log into the app directly. Food suggestions are welcome but not needed; however, Dr. Muscle gives suggestions on how many calories, protein, carbs, fats to eat per day to lose fat and gain muscle and that information is definitely not going to hurt so put it on the pro side for workout apps. Not sure if anyone will agree, but having an AI ChatBot to ask questions to as if they are a trainer is probably the same as the Chatbots that are NOT made to be fitness trainers but can still be asked the same kind of stuff...so unless it's advanced and developed with fitness direction in mind, it's not too important.

Sorry to repeat myself so much, I have trouble with that sometimes and wanted to make sure I got in as much as I could remember and explained as much as possible. If you have any further questions before suggesting, feel free to ask! Btw... the apps I'm currently looking at are approx $60-80 per year. Thanks again for reading and getting this far regardless of the mess that I've made of this post. lol"

Can someone help me put together a routine for when u go to the gym so I'm not standing there aimlessly. I'm also not very familiar with names of workouts either so maybe dumb it down for me.

Getting lean enough to be ripped with ABs, or training yourself to bench 500lbs. Both are titanic accomplishments that the majority will never see but, which would YOU say is the MOST impressive? 

I'm tempted to say ABs, because almost NOBODY knows how to truely diet effectively for fatloss. But then i think of how much dedication it would take to get to where you can lift 500lbs. 

One accomplishment is mostly knowledge & mental-based, knowing how to Diet effectively, having the willpower and strategies to stay on track when so many others fail. The other is mostly of the physical but, a long-term dedication to training and going HARD in the gym. Most will never get to this level either.

I've noticed fat-loss (as well as weight loss), but I'm unsure if me suffering in the cold has played a factor in it at all? 

I used to do cardio/exercise before, but ever since I've started immersing myself in the cold I have begun to take it more seriously, so that could be a factor too (me taking it seriously).

Some numbers:

I'll run for about 15 minutes (trying to work on my cardio)

I walk to and from high-school, which is about 4 miles in total

I get around 3-4k more outdoor steps, and then where I can indoors (with my windows open) get around 3-4k more. Usually I average around 13-15k steps daily.

I also sleep with my window open for maximum coldness.

Now, there's no doubt coldness makes me burn fat/calories - I've experienced it, but what I want to know if the difference is so big that I should continue doing so or if they're too tiny for me to put up with the suffering?

1fwpg77,A Basic Plan for Exercise,2024-10-05 12:38:38,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Exercise/comments/1fwpg77/a_basic_plan_for_exercise/,"Below is my best attempt to synthesize the research literature on fitness into something digestible and informs a basic exercise program.¬†¬†Basically, there four kinds of fitness training:

* **Strength** for muscle mass, bone & tendon strength, and strength as the ability to generate force.¬†¬†Important because muscle the big reservoir for glucose‚Äîhealthy muscle mass helps us regulate insulin and be metabolically healthy. Also because frailty is deadly: we need to be able to do work, take a hit, or fall without having bones or tendons break.¬†
* **Aerobic**, critical for health, lifespan, and athletic performance over time.¬†¬†Also important for regulating metabolic function, helping us do work, and critical for avoiding cardiovascular disease.
* **Metabolic**, for powerful energy systems, preventing cancer, and preventing cardiovascular disease.¬†¬†Also so we can explode into action: fighting and moving fast when we need to.
* **Stability & mobility**, so we can move in a full range of motion and do functional things without repetitive acute injury.¬†

**A Basic Exercise Plan**:

Here‚Äôs a practical example training plan: something in between a minimalist program that has some kind of effect, and an optimal program like a dedicated competitor or pro athlete might have.¬†¬†*What can someone with a day job reasonably do to improve overall fitness?*¬†¬†This is also holistic, not optimized for one modality: it‚Äôs not about being the best runner, the best powerlifter or bodybuilder, etc.¬†¬†It‚Äôs about overall fitness: general physical preparedness and long term health. Take the below blocks and arrange them however needed, e.g. maybe Monday all someone could squeeze in is a lift, but maybe on Wednesday they can lift and do some cardio.

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*Strength* (Push/Pull) 1x per week.¬†¬†Two pushes under load (e.g. bench press, OH press, push-ups), and two pulls under load (e.g pull ups, row). 3 hard sets for each movement.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*Strength* (Legs) 1x per week: Sumo deadlift, one knee extension (e.g. quad extension, lunge), one hip extension (e.g. glute bridge, KB swing). 3 hard sets for each movement.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*Cardio*: 2-3x per week. 30-45 minutes doing anything (jogging, biking, elliptical) in Zone 2 (hard enough that while you CAN talk, you don‚Äôt want to talk).

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*Metabolic*: 1x per week: Some kind of explosive interval work, e.g. sprint work, HIIT, Norwegian 4x4 protocol, BJJ rolling/Boxing, Tabata protocol.¬†¬†This should gas you quickly, hence the need for recovery intervals.

5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*Stability & mobility* exercise snacks: 5-10 minutes, 3-4x per week that improve balance (single leg balance movements, tree pose, eyes closed leg lift) and mobility (e.g. Cossack squats, windmills, Thoracic Spine Opener).

6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*Active recovery*: 1 WHOLE day x week. Hike, yoga, golf, etc.¬†¬†Don‚Äôt lie on the couch, but don‚Äôt train.

¬†Again, this is a kind of middle ground, will definitely change your body and performance, but you don't have to live in the gym approach.  You can modify it.  Just one cardio and one strength session a week beats the hell out of sitting on the couch.  If you want to be a powerlifter, you can do more strength work and over time optimize for that.  But this at least gets you going across the range of fitness dimensions and towards better health."
1fwnrof,Hi.  Not sure if this is the right place to ask about recommendation for the type of strength & conditioning app I would like.,2024-10-05 10:55:26,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Exercise/comments/1fwnrof/hi_not_sure_if_this_is_the_right_place_to_ask/,"Good morning.

(Oops, can‚Äôt edit title.  I meant to write strength and resistance training, not strength and conditioning). 

I have been on weight loss medication since April 24th and between the medication, eating better, and cardio, strength, and resistance exercises, I have as of this morning lost 62.8 pounds.  I started at 229 and my goal weight is 150.  I am a 5‚Äô2 63 year old female.

According to my Renpho scale/app my muscle mass has improved 3 pounds (It was a little better at one point though). I am trying to do everything I can to build my muscle mass some more.  I have a dietitian and use myfitnesspal to help me meet my macronutrient goals.

When I go to the gym, ascertaining how many calories I have burned using the equipment for cardio workouts is easy because the equipment reports this.  However, when I workout with my trainer for strength and resistance training I have absolutely no idea how to estimate how many calories I have burned.  Each of these workout sessions lasts 1/2 hour and I believe I work these pretty hard.  I have been making completely wild guesses at how many calories have been burned.  I have read that a person can only estimate the burn of calories for strength and resistance training, but there has to be a way to get a better idea of how many  are burned besides wild guesses?

Does anyone know of an app that can help me get anywhere near getting a better idea of how many calories I may have burned during strength and resistance training?  I have tried to search the Apple app store and the number of workout apps is a bit overwhelming and I don‚Äôt see any so far that can help me figure out approximate calories burned for strength and resistance training.  Is anyone aware of one?

Life long weight lifter of some 20 years, Had a 4 year break. 

Back lifting 3-5 times a week for the last 12 months. 
Sleep 7-8 hours per night. Sometimes broken. 

Diet is pretty bland - consists of meat, rice and veggies aside from one evening a week I have takeout and some sweets. 
Supplementation wise I take a well formulated multi vit and a greens powder with added fibre. 
Between food and protein powder I get anywhere from 150-200g protein daily. 

The issue being my CNS exhausts super quickly. I am good for 30mins training max before I am completely ruined to the point where I feel I could fall asleep in the gym. 

I've just taken a week off lifting and trained this morning and was completey flat within 30mins. 

I've tried splitting cardio out but basically if I do 30mins of training I am useless for the day. 

I have had bloods done and am told T levels and tsh etc. Is all fine. 

I have no significant health conditions. 

Any ideas what I'm missing or could try? Lifting weights is basically my only outlet and I'll do cardio but don't enjoy it. 

Thanks.

1fw0mk1,How do I gaslight myself into habit-forming or enjoying exercising and lifting consistently,2024-10-04 14:34:16,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Exercise/comments/1fw0mk1/how_do_i_gaslight_myself_into_habitforming_or/,"Exercise is PAIN.

How do you get past that?

When I go to try exercising, or getting into a workout routine, all I'm feeling is pain and tiredness after a while.

Sometimes I can push past that by thinking about my life goals, or not thinking about the pain or the voice in my head that says I want to stop, or thinking okay this is a challenge and I won't back down from a challenge, or other stuff like that.

But this falls apart for me in the long run. It's like trying to punch a brick wall and telling yourself, ""yes, this is good for me,"" but your body is telling you otherwise no matter what you have convinced your mind of.

Furthermore, time I spend exercising is time I take away from other things I want to do such as learning new skills or creating things.

Things I've tried:

**-1.** I reduced the friction between me and exercising. I have dumbbells in my room and a nice mat. Because there is no way I was going to go out of my way to go to a gym to work out on a daily basis. I value efficiency and being able to do this by myself.

**-2.** I told myself I'll make it simple, cold turkey, and just do a short, 30 minute workout routine daily or as often as my fatigue lets me like maybe 2-3 times a week. While the cold-turkey method has worked for other habits of mine, it did not work at all here. This fell apart in a week.

**-3.** Visualizing success. Many people say I need to visualize what I want out of this. Visualize the fit, muscular me I am working on building. Okay yeah, I know visualization is a motivating thing, and it does give me a little motivation, but evidently not enough to make me really commit.

**-4.** ""Kill the voice in your head that says no or that says this is painful."" Well, this helps me see my workouts to the end alongside the voices in my head that says ""see this to the end, end strong, do my best, just a little more, just a little more again, and I may as well give it my full effort now that I'm here!"" - that last one being one of the best things I say to myself that has made me give my all to all things I do over the years... but whatever this advice is, it has not helped me build consistency.

Normally, I think about what I stand to gain, or how it aligns with my current values and beliefs. I push away the voice in my head that thinks about it as pain. But since I'm explaining my situation, of course, I am talking about that more here now.

**-5.** I tried making this a habit-forming thing using something recommended by the author of Atomic Habits who writes, ""Instead of doing the full thing, start by having yourself do the bare minimum, even if that means just laying down on your exercise mat and doing nothing else. Or if it means working out for only 3 minutes instead of 30. Whatever it is, just do it daily. Sometimes the obstacle is in just getting started.""

This was great at first, but eventually my pre-existing daily life routine overwrote it. I got farther than when I told myself I was going to dedicate myself all the time, but it fizzled out at some point. My time for working out is when I get home from work, before I do anything else, because otherwise I'm not going to have another good time for it because soon after work is sleep, and I'm going to want to shower after my workout and before I sleep.

Anyway, I at some point lost motivation to keep working out (again). Although logically I know in the long run that exercising will benefit me more than not, it's like I can not convince my body that there is any point to this.

I often think it would be fun if I could gamify working out, like have a counter for how many squats, pullups, sit-ups, whatever I can do. But unless there is a program that will count it for me from a webcam, I think I would tire of doing daily data-input every time.

I think if I could go visit a literal obstacle course and run it a few times, I would legitimately enjoy that like a kid on a jungle gym. Like those things you see in military movies where people jump between tires. Of course, there is no such thing close-by. I think even rock climbing would be fun to do again as I last did it when I was young, but I do not live very close to any YMCAs or mountains.

I have lived my whole life without seriously working out. In the past, I used to think it was literally pointless, so not even my thoughts were aligned with it - because after all, I lived for so long already, it's not as if my life is in danger if I don't work out.

I am at least past kind of mindset, and I've even taken an interest in the science of it that I was never taught in highschool, and I see it as beneficial to my long term health and what fun I could have by having more physical strength and endurance and stuff, but... I dunno.

I personally feel like this is less a self-motivation thing where I just ""gotta tell myself to do it and have discipline"" thing (which works great for many other things in my life) and more like ""I'm trying to convince myself to enjoy or ignore pain"".

How do people get past this ""wall""?"

I‚Äôve never been good at exercising and am not athletic. I‚Äôve made several false starts at making a routine in my life that never stuck. I‚Äôm currently trying to commit to two days a week at the gym and have been doing well so far.

My confusion is that every time in the past I have done exercise I have been very sore in the days after. Now at 44, I was anticipating some initial joint discomfort, achiness, etc. I‚Äôll go to the gym and work an area (say, arms) using machines until I‚Äôm burning and the muscle is shaking and absolutely couldn‚Äôt do another rep or set. But the next day I‚Äôm really not sore and I don‚Äôt know why.

Sorry if this question sounds dumb, I just don‚Äôt understand. Not being sore makes me feel like I‚Äôm not accomplishing as much as I could be? That‚Äôs probably wrong thinking. But in the moment it feels like a solid workout has been accomplished so I guess I‚Äôm just asking if this is normal and why am I not sore? What are some reasons my current experience isn‚Äôt matching my past experiences when I wouldn‚Äôt be able to move without groaning for about 3 days after?"

1ft64h6,Oatmeal and Honey?,2024-09-30 20:45:26,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Exercise/comments/1ft64h6/oatmeal_and_honey/,"In my search to find the food that best fuels my workouts, I‚Äôve stumbled on honey and cooked oatmeal (like what people have for a standard breakfast). I‚Äôll eat around a cup of oatmeal and a generous amount of honey within 1 hour of training. ***Caffeine makes me feel good for 1 minute, then I get tired and snacky, hence this search.*** Oatmeal+Honey is my go-to if I‚Äôm sleepy as well, basically functioning as my coffee equivalent. 

This combination makes me feel calm, clear, happy, excited to train, and it also helps me poop if I have a somewhat full stomach. I feel the effects nearly immediately. It sustains me through the workout, and I feel amazing afterwards, with no shakiness or crash post-training. I almost feel like I could do a second workout in the day. 

I assumed that any complex carb + honey would give me the same effects, but it just doesn‚Äôt. White or brown rice, any kind of bread, white and sweet potatoes, pasta - nothing came close to giving me the lasting ‚Äúcarb buzz‚Äù that oatmeal+honey gives me. They basically just made me feel full, or gave me a shortened amount of energy that didn‚Äôt last. Cookies or cake come closer to the desired effect, but didn‚Äôt have the lasting effect of O+H energy.  

Honey can be swapped out for brown or white sugar, or apple or orange juice, but these don‚Äôt give the best ‚Äúcarb buzz‚Äù that honey offers. 

Overnight oats don‚Äôt work, they must be cooked in boiling water to fully cook the oats. Overnight oats just make me feel full. Rolled or steel cut oats both work, as long as they are fully cooked. 

Is there something special about oats that is nutritionally/biologically different than other complex carbs? Or is this just a unique preference that my body wants for some reason?

I‚Äôd love to share something with you and get some feedback/ see if there‚Äôs interest for what I‚Äôm thinking of making. In short, I‚Äôm beginning to make a fantasy adventure activity app (mostly for walking and running) called Whander. You can see my launch site [here](https://www.whander.io/). Really I‚Äôm just collecting emails of those interested and linking to some Reddit/ Discord communities I‚Äôve set up to collect some feedback as I go.

To give you some more background, I used to be a big runner, but earlier this year tore my ACL (wouldn‚Äôt recommend). I‚Äôve been VERY slowly getting back to running and historically I‚Äôve been motivated either by (a) Strava badges or (b) going ‚Äòsomewhere‚Äô on a long run (e.g. doing a chore that‚Äôs 15km away or something).

Strava badges are weirdly motivational for me, but they‚Äôre few and far between - for running you have 5k, 10k, half marathon, and 100k badge every month. Huge gap in distance between 10k and 100k, so I feel like there was this big slog where I didn‚Äôt have the gamified benefits as part of running. And as a bit of a D&D nerd/ big fan of the classic Pokemon games (not Pokemon Go), I‚Äôve kind of yearned to have some kind of quest or storyline structure as part of the exercise I do.

This brought me to the idea for Whander - I want to set up an app where you create your own avatar and travel through different worlds, completing storylines in each and weaving between them (e.g. there would be worlds based on the Roman Empire, a clockwork city, celestial gardens, the wild west, etc. down the line). I have a lot more detail but the first thing I wanted to check is if this general idea is interesting to people, and something they may want to try out and demo if I began to build it!

Also, I‚Äôve only begun to work on the art and design for the launch site and the character creation screen, so apologies that the other features on the site aren‚Äôt linked yet! Though the plan is to begin some mockups later this week if I don‚Äôt get absolutely roasted (or if I get roasted in the right way).

Let me know what you think or if you have any other questions - I‚Äôm sure I haven‚Äôt explained everything very well!"

When you work out, you tear little rips in your muscles. That's what soreness is. It takes time to fill in those little rips, and that's what building muscle is.

I'm not sure if this is right or not, because sometimes I'm not super sore, or sore At all. I don't know if that means I didn't do enough, or if I'm still gaining muscle or not.

1fqswbm,Miracle,2024-09-27 17:15:12,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Exercise/comments/1fqswbm/miracle/,"The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges issued a 2015 report that called exercise a ‚Äúmiracle cure‚Äù for the treatment and prevention of various diseases.^(1) Indeed, as a paper in the *Journal of Applied Physiology* in the year 2000 stated, ""With the possible exception of diet modification, we know of no single intervention with greater promise than physical exercise to reduce the risk of virtually all chronic diseases simultaneously.""*^(2)*

Such superlatives are usually inappropriate in science.  
In this case, however, they‚Äôre wholly justified.  
How does exercise make you healthier? Let me count the ways. Exercise boosts immunity,^(3) reduces the risk of upper respiratory-tract infections,^(4) and reduces systemic inflammation^(5) (it lowers C-reactive protein, an inflammatory marker). Exercise raises ‚Äúgood‚Äù HDL cholesterol,^(6) lowers ‚Äúbad‚Äù LDL cholesterol, and lowers triglycerides.^(7)  
Exercise reduces blood clotting,^(8),^(9) significantly lowers blood pressure,^(10,11) and reduces the risk of stroke.^(12)  
One meta-analysis found that active people were almost half as likely to die of heart disease.^(13) In general, there is a dose-response relationship (the more, the better) between exercise and reduction in heart-disease risk.^(14)

Active people are 30-40% less likely to get colon cancer, and active women are 20-30% less likely to get breast cancer.^(15) Physical activity probably reduces the risk of endometrial cancer, and may reduce the risk of prostate, stomach, and ovarian cancer.^(16)

Exercise prevents Type 2 diabetes,^(17) and improves glycemic control in Type 2 diabetics.^(18)

Exercise improves the functional capacity of people with multiple sclerosis,^(19) and is associated with a much lower chance of erectile dysfunction.^(20) (A fact which will inspire many men more than the dramatic effects on heart disease, cancer, and death.)

Exercise reduces lower back pain,21 reduces age-related loss of muscle mass^(22) and aerobic capacity,^(23) and reduces the risk of hip fractures,^(24) arthritis,^(25,26) and osteoporosis.^(27)

Exercise improves memory^(28) and cognitive performance,^(29) and reduces the risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs^(30) and Parkinson‚Äôs Disease.^(31) Exercise improves depression treatment^(32) and has an ‚Äúantidepressant effect.‚Äù^(33)

Exercise improves sleep quality,^(34) enhances body image,^(35) reduces anxiety,^(36) and makes people happier.^(37,38,39,40,41,42)

Exercise significantly reduces the risk of dying from any cause (all-cause mortality) in a dose-dependent fashion, with a 19% risk reduction for people exercising 2.5 hours per week.^(43)

Independent of any effect on weight loss, exercise reduces waist circumference and intra-abdominal (‚Äúvisceral‚Äù) fat.^(44) Since exercise can cut fat and build muscle at the same time,^(45) the bathroom scale isn‚Äôt always a reliable measure of progress; exercise can improve body composition without weight loss.^(46)

A 2015 study assessed ten sets of identical male twins in which one twin had exercised much more than the other twin over the previous three years. On average, the twin who exercised more had better insulin sensitivity, weighed less (despite having more lean body mass), had less body fat, and had more brain matter.^(47)

As noted in the textbook *Advanced Exercise Physiology*, ‚Äúthousands of genes change expression during physical activity or inactivity,‚Äù^(48) and ‚Äúexercise induces dramatic changes in the hormonal mileu.‚Äù^(49)

This textbook goes on to state:

\*Physical activity is a natural cycle that is integrated into most other cycles in humans and animals. A disruption in the expected daily cycle of physical activity elicits disruptions in other cycles, leading to abnormal gene expression and systemic dysfunctions\*\*\**^(50)* \*... genes were optimized to support physical activity for survival. In the absence of historical physical activity levels, inherited genes ‚Äúmisfire‚Äù and function incorrectly.\*^(51)

Regular exercise fixes that. And it can help fix you.

",2024-09-21 16:54:01,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Exercise/comments/1fm7fsq/how_long_did_it_take_to_see_mental_health/,"Just 2 questions to people here:

1. How long did it take to see mental health improvements?
2. And what improvements were they?

I initially started exercising purely for physical reasons. I was sedentary for a long time, was at least 20 pounds overweight (if not more), and thought I needed to reshape my body as I was about to go abroad in 5 months, so thought of doing something to tone my body. I did many strenuous exercises like HIIT, soft ones like walking, and also intensive yoga like Power yoga, and mild ones like Yin yoga (took me at least a month to get used to it and another month to start the more difficult ones).

So my reason for starting exercise was purely physical; however, what surprised me most was the mental health benefits I received. But it took me about 3 months to finally feel the psychological improvements. The first month was rough -- getting back to exercise after being sedentary for so long was very difficult, as I felt pain and sore all over my body. By the second month, I was getting used to the exercises, and also started to enjoy them. But it took me at least 3 months, to finally notice a change in my mental well-being.

Here are some of the changes:

* Marked decrease in depression, anxiety and paranoia.
* Improvement in my ADHD symptom - could concentrate more in my studies and other things
* Improvement in my appetite and eating habits - craved healthy foods over unhealthy snacks
* Lesser sleeping problems
* A perpetual feeling of being 'high', a spiritual feeling of being one with the universe (I credit yoga more for this).

Unfortunately, I stopped exercising a few months later... and then gained weight. And then I again exercised (and got many of these benefits). And now I will start my exercise regime again and found this sub so thought of sharing my views."

How should I progress in my training without training for a longer period (instead of adding more reps)?

My current ab 100-rep ab routine:

**- 30 leg raises**

**- 20 alternating toe touches**

- short rest

**- 30 alternating toe touches** 

**- 20 leg raises** with opening up legs wide at the bottom position and then raising them back up

so past year and a half or so, I've been getting more serious about getting healthier. I've been attempting to do so for the past 3 or so years but have been battling depression.

but over the past almost 2 years, I've dropped about 40 pounds by doing smaller scale workouts IE 40 plus various cardio machines on days I get off work early. on average, I try to work out at least three days in a row per week without a break towards the end so my off days are back to back

than on the days where I don't work I try to treadmill if possible and try to burn at least 600 plus calories or 400-600 on elliptical before I stop and go to upper body for however long till I feel like I did enough. either way I try to put in at least an hour of cardio for each of those days

as to my eating habits I've near completely cut out most negative vices, ice cream, candy, etc except for fast food which on a good week I'll limit to just once, on a bad week no more than 2 if possible.

I've also cut down on how many times a day I eat usually trying to eat only once or twice a day and only snacking on the barest calories at work just to keep energy and curtail actually eating.

I've near completely cut out red meat and substitute it for chicken in various forms to get my protein fix but also keep my calories down.

my question is this.
am I doing what I should be? is there anything I'm missing? and Is there anything I shouldn't be doing?

any advice is greatly appreciated"

At this point, I feel pretty satisfied with my cut from ~169 to 140 over a year. It came from slow, gradual changes to my lifestyle but primarily going to the gym every 2 days, walking a shitload, and making Rice and Chicken with vegetables a staple in my diet. Also been tracking calories for 2 months which is when most of the cut happened.

This did build some discipline to the point where when I found myself having less and less control over when, how long, and how often I could go to the gym, I‚Äôd still make some progress.

I‚Äôm considering bulking, but I personally feel I get routine terrible advice from my family. I feel younger brother, despite being an athlete, and very fit, has also given be bad advice, especially as he began less and less fit as he quit some time ago, but I‚Äôd like for you to judge it. 

I asked him for advice on bulking. He told me the following 

* If I really want to keep tracking my calories (This entire thing upsets my family) eat as much protein as I can, and prioritize carbs afterwards to be in a caloric surplus. Since my muscles won‚Äôt show if I don‚Äôt give my body more calories than it needs
* Dont eat until you are satisfied, eat until you are full
* When I told him about our upcoming job that would heavily restrict our ability to go to the gym (We‚Äôd only get sat/sun) he said I shouldn‚Äôt focus on the gym as much as I should focus on eating protein if I want to bulk. I can get muscular even if I don‚Äôt put the work in. (This threw me off)
* He insists all he did was eat mostly protein when he was younger which is why he is buff. Many of his fellow athletes did the same work, maybe harder, than him but some ended up looking skinny and not buff. 

Will add more as I remember, but how does this sound?

After a long and thorough recovery process with a fantastic holistic team who supported me (psychologist, nutritionist, mental health therapist...)  I've managed to recover and I've been given green light for restart exercising 

Obviously my concept of the ""optimal days per week"" to exercise is biased due to my toxic history and I was looking for advice 

Just for reference I obviously don't look for loss weight, just to maintain health, flexibility and feel well overall. I've started with calisthenics and cardio kickboxing tutorials on YouTube 

Is it 4 times a week for 60 to 90 minutes reasonable? Oh, and besides that I tend to go for a walk almost every day for about 60 to 75 minutes but it's not meant to be a power walk, just for pleasure to unwind and relax

* (But slightly bigger legs than suiryu, Not by much. But very noticeable calf size. currently they are also decent size and I ACTUALLY like working calves. Thighs, hamstrings whatever included in the workout pls)
* A nice back (I watch baki as well.)

* Can u put it in a simple way. Just give me a routine. Like 2/3 exercises per muscle group that hits everything. Like (preferably) 2/3 exercises for biceps, triceps, Abs, whatever. Compound exercises also good. (More for back as I want something that resembles a demon like baki),

I can add more stuff later on. But currently I only got 2 dumbbells.

I‚Äôd like an opinion, I‚Äôve stumbled into fitness for fat loss and I basically managed to cut 35-26lbs in a year. Most of which came after I tracked my calories.

I‚Äôm considering bulking up after a bunch of bullshit from my family insisting I‚Äôm anorexic, but I‚Äôm afraid of doing it because (1) I don‚Äôt want to get fat. And (2) I am about to start an 8-4 at-home web development bootcamp, which requires I be on camera at all times. That in addition to projects that I must do outside of class kills my free time basically. 

Due to personal reasons I am not in full control of when and how often I can drive out to the gym. Very little control actually. We all basically have to carpool and they don‚Äôt really respect my schedule even if I tell them a week ahead of time. There are also no gyms within walking distance 

I know I have to stress my muscles enough to actually let them grow, otherwise, if I eat more, I get fat. Simple. Nobody giving me advice seems to understand that. They also insist carbs are the devil and eating protein is like drinking water, according to them, sausage and cheese is good ‚ÄúProtein‚Äù, and they always suggest for me the sugar laden Gatorade chocolate bars as ‚ÄúProtein‚Äù

I‚Äôve been experimenting with a certain routine and I‚Äôd like to know if this should be intense enough to actually bulk:

* 3s/8-12r barbell squats
* 3x/8-12r straight arm lat pulldown
* Between each set: 10r leg raises (4-6s)

(2-5 minute rest)

* 3s/8-12r bent over row
* IDK what it‚Äôs called, but I get a dumbbell in each arm and curl it up 2 sets with my palms downward, two with them sideways, two with them upward. 8-12rep.
* between each set: 10r leg press (4-6s)

(2-5 minute rest)

* 2s/10-15r shoulder press OR lateral shoulder raise
* 2-3s/8-12r bench press
* (Optional) 2s/12-20r bicep curl each arm.
* Between each set: leg press or leg raises as described before.

Each run before rest takes me between 18-22 minutes. For a total of roughly an hour.

I usually finish off any workout with an hour brisk treadmill walk on top of any walking I do that day, and other days (I‚Äôve averaged 10k steps since February). But haven't been able to use the treadmill lately

For the past week I‚Äôve been able to do my weights every other day or every 2 days. With my bootcamp coming up Monday, the best I can hope for is Saturday and Sunday mornings, and even then that‚Äôs uncertain. Could I let myself eat in a surplus with this as long as I do it twice a week? Saturday and sunday?

At the absolute worst, i get zero time to do this. I can continue to keep myself at a deficit and walk a lot as I have been for a year, but I‚Äôm getting a creeping feeling i might be going too far, and might end up skinny fat, might already be."

I walk on break days and do resistance band training a couple of times a week. I have one complete rest day where I permit laziness. 

It's not easy. I assume working out shouldn't ever be too easy but I start and immediately am thinking ""is it almost over?"" 

So the question is, does anyone genuinely enjoy the not being able to breathe cardio workouts? Is it possible to get there? 

I guess I'm hoping people will just say, ""yes I hate every second of it but love how I feel after I cool down and that makes it worth it"" so I'll feel less alone  "

1fb3rpo,Is female bodybuilding for me? 27F. 75kg to 82kg back to 71kg üòé 6 years. ,2024-09-07 10:22:16,24,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fb3rpo,"I posted on r/motivation, telling my story for anyone who is interested.. (I'm not too sure if I can link that with this post? I'm relatively new to Reddit üôà). It's a long read, but it explains a lot about the person I am and goes more into my reasons for wanting to try bodybuilding. I'll try not to bore you too much - please be nice!! üôà

Basically, I discovered a passion around 6 years ago when my mental health took a really bad turn and I started seeing my body fat going up rapidly - which was obviously the gym! I used to get bullied throughout my childhood and even in my adult life about my appearance and the fact I look, sound, and ""act"" like a man. I've always been a tomboy - that's just me! I've never liked make up or ""girly"" things. I'm 1 of 4, with my 3 siblings being all older brothers. I had growth issues growing up due to complications my mum had carrying me - it meant I started puberty at a very young age which brought it's own symptoms such as hirsutism. Either way, I was destined to not be a woman. üòÇ But that's what and who I am! So I decided years ago, rather than fighting the bullies and society on what I should and shouldn't do as a female - I decided to own it. This is who I am, a female who likes ""boy"" things. I work as a full-time aircraft mechanic, I play football, I'm a car mechanic on the side, I race go karts, I watch Formula 1, I build model cars, do track days in my self built turbo'd mk1 mx5.. 

I remember when I was growing up looking at photos of Arnie, Tom Platz, Ronnie, Jay Cutler, even watching the Rocky films and thinking to myself how much I want the full 6 pack, the pecs, massive shoulders, peaky biceps.. Rather than the hourglass, big glutes and fake boob look. (I don't have an issue with that - it's just not for me!). 

I've looked into the different women's bodybuilding classes and I'm under the impression that women's bodybuilding isn't for me based on üëÜüèª..  

I suffer with a really rare condition called neuralgic amyotrophy, which is a brachial plexus injury (caused by severe tonsilitis I had weeks before). It happened around 2 years ago, and it's essentially paralysis of my right scapula and rhomboid, meaning I can't (couldn't) lift my arm above shoulder height in any direction. Along with this, my scapula (shoulder blade) had (has) severe winging, meaning I could barely push at all (bye bye bench press - really annoying as I wanted to do powerlifting before bodybuilding lol). Not to mention the extreme pain for the first month or two.

I had to stop going to the gym entirely, I couldn't even put my arm behind my neck to do barbell squats. Months and months went on and my muscles were quite literally wasting away - my serratus anterior, my front/mid delt, my bicep, they were all fading away. Years of hard work just vanishing before my eyes. The worst thing? It took over 12 months to be diagnosed correctly, and there is NO cure or explination for it at all. 

The specialist told me the best thing to do was to go back to the gym, so the next week I sucked it up and went to the gym. It was an extremely long and slow process. I actually cried at times - how was I supposed to develop my faded muscles when I can't even lift my arm up? And no, not because it hurt - I could've fought through that. But I physically couldn't do it - I was partially parylised! So unbelievably frustrating. ü•≤

But anyway - this is me now. I am so ridiculously proud of me. I squatted 140kg for 2 yesterday and I cried. I can OHP 40kg strict (for like 3 üòÇ). I can deadlift 180kg for 2 again, I can bench 34kg dumbbells for 8 reps now!!! I still have neuralgic amyotrophy, which you can really tell in my lat spread pose (look at how I have to internally rotate my right shoulder to engage my lat, and also the lack of teres major) - I'm pretty asymmetrical as a result. 

So I just wanted your guys/gals opinions? üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏èüôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è 

Thank you!! ü´∂üèª

*P.s. I train my legs the hardest - they're definitely my worst part! I obviously store my fat there üò≠ *"

I'm trying to grow my butt and only my butt. I hate working out but I do want to start somewhere and right now, working out my butt has been fun for some reason.

I've been doing three exercises with only one set of 15. That's all I can do for now but I do hope to add more sets and reps as my glutes get stronger.

Here's the thing. Since all I'm doing is working out my glutes, (and I'm a complete novice in the world of working out) I'm worried about hurting myself. I was planning on doing these three workouts, which consists of donkey kicks, glute bridges and clamshells on all fours (don't know the name of it), basically every day and resting on Sundays or something like that, but idk if doing these workouts every single day and resting only one day a week would be a bad idea and leaf to me hurting myself or being in constant pain for not letting my muscles properly rest.

So with that said, how often do you guys think I should work out my glutes. (Remember that I'm only working out my glutes for now)

Thank you."

But lately I've been noticing how it feels like I have so much more abdominal fat that I used to and its kinda concerning and very uncomfortable. I feel like 1lb per week is slow enough but feeling and looking worse for strength gain even if its just temporary almost doesn't seem worth it. I've been doing cardio as well at least 150 min per week so I'm hitting acsm guidlines. Maybe I need to walk more outside of the gym/ playing sports? Should I do more core exercise? I also started stomach gripping unconsciously from the gained weight which might be making it worse by making my core muscles weaker.

I used to weight 175. I am 5'8. I never exercised, I‚Äôd sit in my bed all day either playing video games, YouTube, studying, college work, applying for jobs I‚Äôd never gotten. Until my sister put a good word in for me and I got my first job. That promptly stole a chunk of my wages then threw me out like trash. I‚Äôd only get up to eat or use the bathroom. And it‚Äôd always be junk.

Obviously since then I improved. Course I still love video games and stuff and in the early stages I‚Äôd still pound out chips and cookies, but long bouts of boredom from a 10 day work vacation got me to fill that void with some exercise. Been a habit since. Slowly cleaned up my eating which still is far from perfect but I‚Äôm much more informed. I gradually cut down from 175 to 140 lbs. 

Family is now comparing me to 50 Cent when he starved himself to play Deon in ‚ÄúAll Things Fall Apart‚Äù.

At the start of this year i went veggie and while i didn't maintain it i have i think started to fix some of my diet a bit, also stuck to a total ban on keeping beer in the house pretty much.

Guess what i am really looking for is some inspiration and advice on how best to hit my goal, my goal is to drop to 15kg in 4 months, i figure that takes me into next year with a solid foundation and is a realistic goal (or i think it is).

I am 44 years old, female. Pretty active. I work out 5 days a week and I usually alternate cardio with weights. I have kids so I can't spend 2 hours a day in the gym. I'm finding it difficult to figure out what to do the day after my leg days. I am trying to train for A 5-mile race in November. I am finding it very challenging to follow my leg days with any kind of cardio. I'm wondering if I should just do yoga the day after or if I should focus on a lighter endurance set like my peloton biking or a long Walk?

For perspective, I'm usually doing the peloton lower body workouts which are a lot of deadlifts and squat variations. Lunges, etc. most of the workouts tend to be medium weight timed exercises. They run about 30 minutes long. Not a lot of heavy low rep work. I work in upper body less regularly, probably around once a week although I try to do push-ups. I think I could probably work out 7 days a week, but I just find my motivation to do anything the day after strength training really really low.

My week looks somewhat like this:

M: 45-60 minute endurance peloton ride
T: weights (either full body or lower body) 30-45 minutes 
W: nothing because I'm tired 
Th: 45 minute jog/walk with core after 
F: weights (same as T)
Sa: nothing because I'm tired üòÜ 
Su: jog/walk or peloton 

I stretch after and stuff. I eat well and hydrate. I just don't feel like I'm recovering completely after the weights and I don't know if it's age or mental block or what. "

I had a pretty major surgery and was bed bound for a while. I've never been strong or particularly in shape but I'm finding things like lifting a gallon of milk difficult. I was also 130lbs this time last year but that was largely due to not eating. 

I'm hoping to get some kind of advice on ways to build lean muscle for someone in my situation. I've never tried to build muscle in my life and there's so much conflicting information online. I'll need to do the exercises at home and I'd really prefer something that I can do while watching TV or listening to a book. 

What equipment can I buy? What exercise can I do or what guides can I follow?

1ezy6zo,Calorie count body weight exercise vs walking,2024-08-24 05:48:15,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Exercise/comments/1ezy6zo/calorie_count_body_weight_exercise_vs_walking/,"I am a very beginner when it comes to working out. I am 30. When I was younger I was in shape. I used to be on a swim team and would weight train twice a day in addition to swimming. Used to be able to swim multiple miles. I could do 100 pushups at a time without a huge struggle. 

Now I‚Äôm terribly out of shape. Haven‚Äôt worked out in ten years. Spent many of those years smoking and drinking. Now I‚Äôm totally sober and looking to get into shape. I‚Äôm roughly 5‚Äô 11‚Äù and 170 lb. I‚Äôll be Lucky if I could do 20 pushups at a time and my arms would definitely burn for the rest of the day. I‚Äôll be lucky if I can run for 3 minutes without being totally winded, and I would definitely be sore after this. 

I‚Äôm looking to start off gradual‚Ä¶as one does. 

I‚Äôm looking into making a daily routine I do regardless of what region I‚Äôm focusing on, and then having a specific region to focus on each day. I plan on using mostly body weight and dumb bell exercises because they are the safest options for working out alone. (No risk of dropping a bar on myself.)

When I was younger I never counted calories or tried to keep track of anything. I just did what the coach told me to do. If they said swim a 500 I seam a 500. If they said to do push ups I did push ups. If they said it was back and shoulder day, then that‚Äôs what I did. If they said it was chest day, that‚Äôs what I did. They had a varied routine that focused different areas all figure out‚Ä¶in other words they did all the prep work and all the thinking for me. 

Now I need to be able to do that for myself.  I‚Äôve got this very basic workout that I just typed up‚Ä¶and I have some questions about the calories or purpose of these exercises. 

This is the daily workout before the specific body region exercises. 

Daily basic bodyweight exercises: Will increase every month for the first year.  

3 sets of 5 regular Push Ups. (Increase by 2 per month.) 
3 sets of 5 Wide Push Ups. (Increase by 2 per month. No more than ten per set. Maximum of 3 sets.) 
3 sets of 5 Diamond Push Ups. (Increase by 2 per month. No more than ten per set. Maximum of 3 sets.) 
3 sets of 15 Sit Ups. (Increase by 5 per month. No more than 30 per set for the first year. No more than three sets.) 
3 sets of 15 crunches. (Increase by 5 per month. No more than 30 per set for the first year. No more than three sets.) 
3 sets of 15 Jumping Jacks (Increase by 2 per month. No more than 30 per set for the first year. No more than three sets.) 
3 sets of 15 lunges. (Increase by 5 per month. No more than 30 per set for the first year. No more than three sets.) 
3 sets of 15 Squats (Increase by 5 per month. No more than 30 per set for the first year. No more than three sets.) 

So my questions pertains to calories burned. After day one of this workout, I would have burned a measly 63 calories. At the end of the elevated routine by month 6, I would be burning 120 calories. 

This is not a lot of calories at all. And has me questioning the value of even doing this exercise when I can just walk for 20 minutes to burn the same amount of calories. Or 40 minutes 6 months in. 

Are these exercises going to increase my muscle mass and help me burn calories in the long run? 

I will also be doing some stretching and yoga before doing this routine, and I will have a routine after this using dumbbells for each day targeting a different muscle group. I might do back and shoulders on Monday, arms and chest on Tuesday. Legs on Friday. Etc. 

I know some cardio would do me good and I will introduce some swimming or cycling into this at some point sooner rather than later. 

Is this worth doing? Am I missing something? Any advice or recommendations?

1ey9phj,How to make strength training more interesting?,2024-08-22 03:45:35,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Exercise/comments/1ey9phj/how_to_make_strength_training_more_interesting/,"Hello r/exercise!

I'm curious on how other people made their training and workouts more interesting and easier to have the motivation to go back to consistently.

Personally my type of activity doesn't involve much strength training or working out in the traditional gym sense. I usually do things such as skateboarding, ice skating, hiking, and golf to stay active. I've always kind of had a stocky build and have started to lean out by eating healthier and I want to try and be more active in a tradition gym sense because I want to have more physical strength as well as gaining more muscle definition. 

The issue is that I find weight lifting incredibly boring compared to the other activities I already do. Skateboarding as well as ice skating and golf all have techniques and progression in learning new things that makes me feel like I'm constantly learning something new or at least overcoming the barriers and pushing my knowledge and fear thresholds of what I can do.

-- weight lifting has obvious progression, getting strong and changing your body positively; but after you learn the initial techniques it's just kind of boring because all I am noticing is a number go up until I plateau and have to change something. Yes the mental battle is there, overcoming pain and what you think you can do; mindset and all that. I know that is all there, I'm just struggling with motivation knowing that I'm just driving to a gym to do the same thing on repeat - doing arms, back, leg etc. 

Are there ways that you've developed your weight training to make it feel more interesting, trying different ways to work and progress the same muscle groups or ways that you might have game-ified your workouts to ""feel"" as if it had progression even though you knew you were progressing and getting stronger/healthier?"

Last year, I decided to gradually change aspects of my lifestyle to lose weight. I try to go to the gym every 2 days, sometimes scheduling conflicts make me wait 3. I eat whatever I feel like but gradually introducing less calorie dense Whole Foods which I am really enjoying. 

In the past month, I actually started to track calories which opened my eyes to how dense certain foods are and I‚Äôm altering my diet to compensate.

I‚Äôve been walking 7-12k steps everyday. Even if I need to do it in my own house.

I‚Äôm down over 20 pounds. This does not sit well with my family, they don‚Äôt outright say it but the way they love to scream at me and badger me over this, they think I‚Äôm fucking anorexic, i eat like a bird, i need to stop giving a fuck about sugar, but at the same time they tell me carbs are evil and I should cut them out completely, but they don‚Äôt cooperate and still buy high calorie junk carbs.

They say I should eat more protein, but tell me chicken and fish are bad sources and suggest ground beef, hot dogs, sausage egg and cheese with butter.

In the next month, I‚Äôll be working an at home job from 8AM to 4 PM, and in addition to that projects, which basically requires I sit in front of a computer all day. Something I haven‚Äôt done before. 

This is going to screw over my routine, especially as we share a car now and I‚Äôm unable to just go whenever I want, they tell me I should wake up early to do but the problem is they never let me fucking sleep, and whenever I have to go early they either suddenly need the care or insist we carpool then take 2 hours to put their shoes on, only to tell me I have 30 minutes or they‚Äôll leave me stranded till 8 PM. Basically just an excuse to chump whatever I‚Äôm trying to do. And they‚Äôre starting to do this with my walking as well, getting upset when I don‚Äôt listen to them on how I walk too much.

so in the absolute worst case scenario I will need to fully commit to eating a certain way if I can‚Äôt walk or exercise as much as I want. Staying in a deficit. That‚Äôs not fine with them either. They think I‚Äôm doing some aggressive routine and want a six pack or already have a goal weight in mind when really I‚Äôm just making gradual changes. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm doing. 

My mother and brother's suggestions boil down to this:

* 150g of protein every single day, nothing on fiber. They got upset when I said that was good advice that will improve my fat loss.
* Zero carbs
* Eat in a surplus
* Core exercises to burn my stomach fat
* Stop weighing my food. I can eat as much as I want as long as it‚Äôs protein. Hell they‚Äôd get especially pissed when I measure sauces or butter or sugar.
* 3 full plateful meals a day, THEN I go to the gym at night. This has never worked for me honestly. And clearly isn‚Äôt making my brother any less fat or more muscular 
* Stop walking as much as I do
* Look into ‚ÄúBody shaping‚Äù
* Sleep better. No they don‚Äôt plan on shutting up at night. I should just sleep better.

I‚Äôll add more as I remember it, that conversation was just a screaming match, and I‚Äôm so sorry if this doesn‚Äôt sound coherent.

I‚Äôm willing to hear you guys out on this. "

I‚Äôm looking for advice on exercises that target specific issues. I‚Äôm a 24-year-old woman who is generally happy with my body composition‚Äîmy fat distribution is even, and I have a flat stomach. However, my inner thighs are significantly larger than I‚Äôd like, and I feel self-conscious wearing tight jeans.

I‚Äôve tried losing weight in the past, and while I saw improvements in my thighs, my overall body didn't look balanced. After gaining a bit of weight (now at 54kg), my body is back to normal, but my inner thighs still seem disproportionate.

Can anyone suggest effective exercises to tone and reduce fat in my inner thighs? I‚Äôm looking for a solution that will help me achieve a more balanced look without losing weight from other areas.

Thanks in advance"

1eue993,Alternatives for squat and deadlifts?,2024-08-17 10:06:50,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Exercise/comments/1eue993/alternatives_for_squat_and_deadlifts/,"A bit of a lengthy one sorry.

So for context I‚Äôm lifting not to get primarily super strong or huge but just to supplement my BJJ. I grapple 4-5 times a week and would usually lift 2/3 times a week (upper, lower and full body/ endurance training)

My old routine would suggest me to target hamstrings and quads separately so I have an excuse to skip squats/ deadlifts for leg press, single leg deadlifts, extension and curls, along with lower back extensions with a bit of weight. 


But given I recently switched my routine to follow a friends since their one seems a bit more time friendly, I‚Äôm a bit hesitant on doing squats and deadlift as my family has had a history of lower back injuries (slip disc) and people who grapple are known to have terrible lower back at some point. 

Basically my question, is there a solid alternative for squats and deadlift without having to add a few more exercises to compensate and target the muscles that are left out (from doing squats and deadlift)


I‚Äôm also looking into a personal trainer to check my form to maybe provide some reassurance since my new gym offers a free PT for the first one.

1esnmpu,[Introducing] The Art of Dragon Slaying: A New Workout for Strength and Unity,2024-08-15 05:50:19,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Exercise/comments/1esnmpu/introducing_the_art_of_dragon_slaying_a_new/,"Greetings, fellow travelers and seekers of strength! Gather 'round, for I have returned from a journey deep into the Earth‚Äôs core, where I discovered an ancient practice passed down by a mystical species. This practice, which I now bring to you, is known as Dragon Slaying.

But let us be clear‚Äî this is not just another workout. This is a daily ritual, a path that unites the body from core to limb in a way that few other practices can. The foundation of Dragon Slaying is simple yet powerful: one exercise per body group, one set per exercise. The sequence is key‚Äî we begin by awakening the core, the center of our strength, then move to empowering the legs, the pillars of our foundation, and finally fortify the upper body, our sword & shield

A Dragon Slaying example routine is below (my personal workout), which is done on the floor, with 2 \* 25lb dumbbells:

Core Activation:

1 x 30 sec plank

1 x 30 sec side plank (left)

1 x 30 sec side plank (right)

We start by engaging the core, the bridge between the upper and lower body. This activation prepares the entire body for the work ahead.

Legs Empowerment:

1 x 30+ dumbbell hang tiptoe squats

Next, we move to the legs. Our unique squat, performed on tiptoes, targets the knees, ankles, and every muscle in the legs, promoting strength and stability.

Upper Body Fortification:

1 x 15 mid-squat, cross-body, dumbbell rotations (below left hip to above right shoulder, straight arms)

1 x 15 mid-squat, cross body, dumbbell rotations (below right hip to above left shoulder, straight arms)

1 x 20 dumbbell chest press, with

1 x 15 chest flyes

1 x 15 dumbbell pullover

1 x 15 dumbbell overhead tricep extensions

1 x 20 dumbbell bent over rows

1 x 15 dumbbell shoulder press

1 x 15 dumbbell curls

Finally, we strengthen the upper body with a series of exercises that target the chest, back, shoulders, and arms. Each set is carefully chosen to ensure balance and power.

How Slaying Dragons Has Helped Me:

Since embracing the sacred art of Dragon Slaying, I have witnessed a profound transformation in both body and mind. My muscles, once mere parts of my form, now feel like a unified force‚Äîpumped, strong, and vibrant. This newfound strength has granted me a deep sense of presence, especially in my legs, as if I truly inhabit every inch of my being. Unlike the aftermath of traditional bodybuilding's leg day, which often leaves the legs weary and sore, Dragon Slaying fills them with life, making them feel powerful and fully engaged.

One of the greatest boons of this practice is the flexibility it bestows upon my daily life. As I navigate the demands of my career, the time to visit the gym often eludes me. Yet, with Dragon Slaying, I can summon my dumbbells at any moment, engaging in a complete and purposeful workout that revitalizes every muscle group without the need for an hour-long session. Even amidst the chaos of the day, I can perform my Dragon Slaying rituals between meetings, emerging from each session energized and ready to face the challenges ahead.

As a dedicated practitioner of yoga, I long sensed a missing element in my practice‚Äî a strength component that didn‚Äôt require acrobatic feats. Dragon Slaying has seamlessly filled this void, bringing the essence of yoga‚Äîunion and balance into the realm of strength training. Through these focused, single-set exercises, I've achieved a unique harmony with my muscles.

The Philosophy:

Dragon Slaying is about unifying the body, not breaking it down. We do one exercise per body group, and only one set. The focus is on filling the muscles with blood, bringing life and consciousness to each part of the body, rather than pushing them to the point of destruction. This practice is not about size, but about strength, vitality, and connection. We want to squeeze the muscles at the right time, for the right pump.

You can perform this routine once or even twice a day. For those serious about their journey, the second session can focus on supporting muscles like calves, forearms, and traps. The goal is not to exhaust but to energize‚Äî to emerge from each session feeling more alive and more connected.

A Daily Ritual:

Dragon Slayers are those who commit to this practice every day. It‚Äôs not about occasionally picking up the dumbbells; it‚Äôs about embracing this path as part of  daily life. Each set is a battle won, each session a dragon slain. And through this discipline, we become stronger, not just in body, but in mind and spirit, so that we can tackle the other dragons of every day life.

Every person can Slay Dragons. They can do some exercises, here and there. They can slay some dragons, here and there. Some days-- 5 exercises. The next day, all the exercises. The day after that, practice is missed. Those people Slay Dragons.

On the other hand, there are Dragon Slayers. Dragon Slayers are people who slay their dragons, every day. They hit each muscle group. They slay the dragon. And like in a video game, their completed exercise sets are their Slaying of Dragons, or killing a difficult boss, or rescuing a noble princess. They are Dragon Slayers because they do their strength yoga every day.

So, fellow adventurers, the choice is yours. Will you join me on this path and become a true Dragon Slayer? The journey awaits.

Further reading for the True Seekers

The Symbol of Dragon Slaying: The symbol of Dragon Slaying draws directly from the iconic dragon statues in Spyro the Dragon on the PS1. This choice is intentional, reflecting the deeper, symbolic meaning of ‚Äúslaying‚Äù in this practice.

In Spyro, the relationships to other dragons are not through destruction, but through liberation. Spyro frees dragons from captivity (the statue they are captured in). Similarly, Dragon Slaying as a workout is about freeing your muscle groups from isolation, bringing them together to work in harmony. It‚Äôs a metaphor for transformation, where the challenge isn‚Äôt just about conquering but about achieving unity and strength. If this symbol resonates with you, and you happen to have a 3D printer at home, a 3D model of the Spyro dragon can be [downloaded here for free from Cults3D](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/art/dragon-statue-with-base-spyro) (not my file, but shout-out to the owner). I've printed this dragon and have it on my office desk as a reminder of the practice :)

Thank you for reading! I will keep incorporating this workout to my day, and may share results if there's interest."

It‚Äôs pointless, boring, waste of time.

Truly. 


I wasn‚Äôt always like this. Avoiding the stairs, looking forward to sitting at any opportunity and grabbing my keys at any volume of someone asking to go to the store. Walking? Pshh, yeah right. Walkings for dogs. 

Then I became tired of being 268lbs. Did things here and there and got down to a comfortable 182lbs. Cortisol is really something. Dropped me on my head to 206.8lbs. Since I was bored, I started lifting in between walking my dog. Now, I can‚Äôt stop exercising daily. Started doing it for 26 seconds, now up to 3hrs almost 70 days later. I‚Äôm hooked. Today, I was annoyed someone took my slot. I‚Äôm okay now, but I can‚Äôt happen to shrug the feeling of how exercising makes me feel. I‚Äôm much happier, I flirt, I seek companionships and not  as  a big loner as I usually am. Hell, my life is much more wholesome. 

Here‚Äôs to exercise, its benefits on not only the human body, but the mind and ultimately, the soul.

Presently at 181lbs. Hoping by end of month I‚Äôll be 176lbs, the weight I haven‚Äôt seen in 17yrs. I was a kid back then.

I really enjoy event running but loathe doing running as training.

I'm fine running a 5k but anything past that and my legs give out well before my lungs, I did a 10k yesterday and felt fine during it but today a knee has gone. I did a trail marathon a few months ago and become immobile for a few days.

Are there any specific gym exercises I can do on my legs to strengthen them up for runs?

For context, I am 32, M, also swim daily and have the goal of just improving fitness; building some muscle and looking better. I already do workouts but that was ad-hoc and want to improve it now.
The questions about the workout and additional stuff to do.

(1) On the rest day, I would like to do some additional cardio ( Eclyptical cross trainer and Cycle ergometer). Shouldn‚Äôt interfere with the routine; right?

(2) I also want to improve posture and flexibility.  I had a couple of ideas of tackling this:
Daily, I do Wall Angels (also called Slides)and this routine https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=FTV6UCh-yhs  each morning and evening
On the rest day, I thought of adding this workout: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=4BOTvaRaDjI 
I supplement the Leg days with some abs exercises like Dead Bugs and RKC Planks,  the Push days with Shoulder Dislocations (rotating shoulders with broomsticks/bands), and the Pull days with low resistance Face Pulls. Makes sense?

(3) any other flexibility, stretching or posture advice you can give? I was also thinking of giving https://www.reddit.com/r/flexibility/wiki/starting_to_stretch a go

(4) I like bodyweight exercises and will do push ups, pull ups, chin Ups and so on. I rarely see planches mentioned but they seem like a push exercise. Weekly I though of doing one Push day with push ups and one with planches. Makes sense?"

I strongly believe my form was not bad. It happened in winter when I did some arm exercises with 0 weights and a tai chi instructor for a couple of weeks and my elbow decided to die.

There are a ton of neurological issues this has caused. I have to be very careful with my neck. I also have epilepsy. Weight lifting is not recommended due to the stress it can put on my neck and I have to keep myself safe in case of seizures.

I am starting to lose weight again after a change in my medication. I want to tighten everything up. Butt, belly, stomach, breasts and arms in particular. 

I have started with diamond wall push ups. I have been making myself go slow just to see if it effects me medically. I am currently at 4 reps of 10 a day and adding as it gets easier as long as i don't feel a strain on my neck. I have also recently started some glute exercises on the floor. Mostly  multiple variations of glute bridges, donkey kicks, straight kickbacks and fire hydrant pulses and circles. I was definitely sore after starting and it felt great to be able to do something since I have been scared to do any exercise other than walking.

I know more intensity would result in more dramatic results, but medically I have to go slow to prevent injury. I'm trying to listen to my body and not push it too hard.

Anyone have any clue how long it should take until I start to notice some subtle improvements in my tone? I don't except anything miraculous, but I know once I start seeing results it will encourage me to keep going. "

I walk 8-12 hours a day, SLOW walking inside the house, I can't sit still :/ I wonder if walking is one of the reasons I'm underweight even though it's slow 

I'm afraid of that if I gained weight I'll start getting it easily and fast and hardly losing it, I'm also afraid of gaining weight where I don't want, and I'm afraid of losing face fat, , if I gained 5-10kg will I gain them in all areas in my body including my face but more in specific areas, or it's possible to gain in one area like thighs?

Can I start without consulting a coach or a nutritionist? Any good sources?

I've been exercising 3 days a week, but at this point I'm about to just switch to every day out of frustration. Either my body breaks or my mind does idgaf. I've been I thinking I need an overhaul to my regimen anyway. I typically lift with dumbbells, and a basic workout would be something like:

Generic warmup

10x goblet squat w 40lbs
30 seconds plank
10x V up w 20lbs
10x curl to extend w 25lbs in both hands
10x 1 leg squat w 20lbs (both sides)
10x pushups
10x renegade row w 20lbs (both sides)
x3

Generic cooldown

Takes about half an hour. The main problem is I'm not a human dumpster and struggle to exceed 2000 cals/day, so barring a full gut transplant I have to sort of meet myself where I'm at. Besides that, I'm probably not doing enough, and may switch trainers because I'm somehow so lost while paying for guidance. My schedule sure is busier, but I still feel like shit when I work out. Not a W.

Having an overall well-abled body that simply rejects improvement outright shouldn't make sense, right? The chronic pain is just a demotivator at this point, but I wouldn't even care if SOMETHING about my body improved lol not feeling like shit after every workout would be awesome too. I don't think anyone relates, but hey just trying to get other perspectives."

I did the Push training session and felt tired and sore for the next few days after. Today I saw an ad from a gym further away from I am than what I would like but it got my attention. The ad said to that do full body workouts instead because it reduces the stress on the whole body. The additional stress from typical muscle group workout days lead causes additional stress on the body which reduced recovery.

I am someone who has been working out for 5+ years with equipment, cardio, strength training, barre, Pilates, yoga etc. Any type of workout I am accustomed to, in order to work out for 30 minutes the key is to breathe. Sometimes involuntarily we hold our breaths, whenever I work out i focus on increasing my breathing and not restricting my breath. Additionally, for harder movements faster, sharper breaths are needed, and I believe that breathing mostly through the nose ensures longevity. For 30-minute workouts, divide the workout into 3 intervals if you are a beginner. Do the first 10 minutes of the workout without a break and then take a break for a minute, drink water and towel off and repeat for each 10 minute interval. Likewise, for 45 minute workouts, divide them into three fifteen minute intervals. After each 15 minutes, take a small break and resume the workout for every 15 minutes. That is my advice to you, good luck!"

I know its normal to be sore after an intense day, but how do you all know when it's too much?

I lack self confidence to go to the gym (plus for me it‚Äôs cheaper to not go). I don‚Äôt have gym equipment (unless you include a yoga mat ü§£). Pretty much the most healthy thing about me is I regularly and consistently do the Akins diet - so high fat, low/no sugar and carbs (I get mix messages about things like diet but frankly this diet seems to suit me well) - and I walk my dog for an hour through a forest. In past I tried to get fit through running/jogging and indoor workouts but an issue always came up (mainly motivation, forgetting to do it or a logistical issue)

Reason for post: So I‚Äôm currently undergoing a ‚Äúpersonal care‚Äù period of my life. So I‚Äôve done things to achieve this but 1 of the things I‚Äôm having trouble with is doing stuff for my physical health. So a family member recommended doing walks with a weighted backpack. This appeals to me because I could do it while dog walking which would help me with motivation. So I got a big sturdy backpack (the kind you might have if you‚Äôre hiking and camping), filled a bunch of 2 litre bottles with water (so each bottle is roughly 2kg) and I adjusted the amount of bottles in the bag that feels comfortable and uncomfortable (which is roughly 10kg). I haven‚Äôt started yet but be doing research and I get mixed messages. So I was wondering if this exercise would be effective and what areas of my body would be affected? The main goal is to lose weight, get fitter and build strength. It would be nice to build muscle but that‚Äôs not the main goal (yet).

Any advice would be appreciated greatly "

The first day the guy who runs the gym ran me through a bunch of equipment and said it‚Äôs a good workout to start with. He is probably correct as he does that for a living. But the whole thing takes over 1.5 hours I find it hard to build a habit if a single trip to the gym costs me two hours. I have other responsibilities around house and kids etc 

For the first six months I want to stick to a simple routine that I can wrap up in like 40ish min. The closes I‚Äôve got was splitting the upper and lower exercise days. But this means I would end up doing 4 trips to the gym. But it becomes a challenge with family commitments. 

I would like for some ideas. Also I would like to stick to a few simple machines. I have access to the following.

1. Leg press
2. Leg curl 
3. Leg extensions
4. Chest press
5. Seated rows
6. Shoulder press
7. Triceps pulldowns 
8. Bicep curls
9. Ab crunch
10. Cardio machines


Goal is to build a habit of exercise, not super worried about physique. But more into mobility, health and general benefits.

I am turning 29 in Sep end and I have been active since I was 23/24. Initially, I used to hot yoga where the studio provided workouts, not just limited to hot yoga. We used to do cardio, strength training, mat pilates & more while lifting weights. I was a beginner into excercising but overtime, built up to it. It helped me really tone my body and it was the first time I felt really great about my body. Fast forward to Sep 2021, I got married, moved across the country & started my Master's. The changes all at once made it challenging to stay on top of my workout routine. 8 months into my marriage, in April 2022, I noticed I had gained quite a bit of weight. I had somewhat of a regular working out regime except one month where it was quite challenging. Nonetheless, I went back to it.  Except, moving across the country, I have not found a similar hot yoga studio. As such, I have done lots of at home workouts (particulary following Sydney Cummings Houdyshell). 

From Jan 2023-Dec 2023, I followed her irregularly and overall, struggled with my routine as my education was taking a toll on me along with many other personal challenges. However, since Jan 2024, I feel like I am finally finding the grove of things. 

I have been doing her 60 mins S&C, cardio & HIIT workouts. I have also been mindful of my eating habits, making sure I'm eating healthy. I have seen amazing results but would like to see more results. I am 5'1 and weight about 57 kg. During Sydney's 60 min workouts, I have progressed from being able to burn 400 calories to an average of 470-515 per workout.  I have noticed a big change in quality of my sleep, physical & mental self. However, recently, I started feeling that perhaps I should also start adding more pilates.

I considered Move with Nicole on YT & have done 1 of her workouts but found it to be overall easy. There were 1-2 challenging pieces but I was overall able to completel the workout and wasn't feeling sore the next day at all. This left me feeling if what I am doing will have an impact on my body? I am trying to understand what my body needs more to ensure consistent results. I workout 4 times a week. I am willing to add more, if and necessary. I workout at home as I do not like the gym. Any advice and insight would be appreciated. Thank you. "

Bon voila, je me lance, premier voyage √† Londres sans les parents.

Le soucis c'est que je suis du genre stress√© et bon bah.. je stress ! C'est la premi√®re fois que je doit tout organiser par moi m√™me, j'emm√®ne mon petit fr√®re avec moi donc je doit tout g√©rer et, en bonus, premi√®re fois que je part en tant ""qu'adulte"" √† l'√©tranger et premi√®re fois que je prend l'avion !

Tout cela fait que j'ai quelques questions, notamment et surtout, au niveau de l'avion et du timing.

Voila, en gros j'ai pris au moins ch√®re. Je part donc avec Ryanair. Le retour notamment se fait au d√©part de Gatwick √† 8h05. Nous logeons dans un h√¥tel √† trois minutes √† pieds de la gare victoria.  
L'id√©e est donc, au d√©part, de prendre un train √† Victoria, de d√©barquer √† l'a√©roport et de rentrer chez nous.

Ce qui me fait peur c'est le timing de tout cela. Combien de temps dois-je pr√©voir ?   
L'id√©al aurait √©t√© de prendre une nuit d‚Äôh√¥tel √† l'a√©roport.. mais j'ai pas √©t√© assez malin pour √ßa et j'ai pas pris l'annulation ou la modification.

Je vois un train partant de victoria arrivant √† l'a√©roport √† 5h49. Pour un avion partant √† 8h √ßa me semble quand m√™me large non ? Sachant que toutes nos valises sont en cabine avec nous, nos passeports, billets seront avec nous, imprim√©s, pr√©par√©s dans une pochette (oui j'ai dit stress√© !).  
Le train pr√©c√©dent part √† 4h35 et arrive √† 5h27.

Mon autre question c'est niveau budget et organisation. Combien pr√©voyez vous comme budget journalier pour ce genre de ville (sans restaurant, plut√¥t sandwich et salade, nous pr√©voyons seulement un fish and chips) ?   
R√©servez vous √† l'avance toutes vos activit√©s ?

Je ne fais que l‚Äôorganisation (pas les r√©servations), donc je cherche √† comprendre vos attentes : quels types de destinations et d'activit√©s int√©ressent ? Quelles sont les priorit√©s entre aventure et relaxation ? Et comment r√©partir le budget entre mes services et le voyage en lui-m√™me ?

Par exemple je peux vous organiser un voyage aux Philippines, avec 2 croisi√®re : une premi√®re de 3j plut√¥t bas√©e sur snorkleing.

Si vous restez plus longtemps, je m'occuperai de trouver d'autres activit√©s : surf, cascades... en fonction de vos envies et budget. 

Voici mon public cible : des voyageurs entre 25 et 45 ans, avec un revenu moyen. Ils veulent d√©couvrir des lieux spectaculaires loin des foules touristiques, vivre une immersion dans la nature et partager des exp√©riences sur les r√©seaux sociaux. 
Ses probl√®mes sont : pas forc√©ment le temps d'organiser, ne sait pas o√π trouver les bonnes infos, ne veulent pas √™tre dans le tourisme de masse, ne veulent pas sacrifier confort et s√©curit√©.

Alors, on a laiss√© l'id√©e de c√¥t√© pendant bien longtemps mais je dois dire que je l'ai toujours dans un coin de la t√™te. Certains d'entre vous ont-ils eu l'opportunit√© de s'y rendre et dans quel contexte? Est-ce que vous d√©conseillez formellement d'y aller? On n'est pas trop du style √† partir en voyage organis√©, mais on ne serait pas contre √™tre accompagn√©s par un guide pour une partie du voyage si n√©cessaire. 

Je crois comprendre que la situation est plus compliqu√©e dans le nord du pays. Cela semble compliqu√© donc d'aller visiter les √©glises rupestres √† Labilela, le Parc du Simien est dans une zone qualifi√©e rouge, la r√©gion Afar et donc le Danakil est d√©conseill√©e. Bon, √ßa fait quand m√™me beaucoup.

Merci √† vous pour vos conseils!"

Je suis un √©tudiant √©tranger actuellement en France et j'ai r√©cemment eu la chance d'√™tre invit√© √† une formation + conf√©rence aux √âtats-Unis d√©but d√©cembre, tous frais pay√©s (billet d'avion, h√¥tel, repas, etc.). J'√©tais super content pour cette opportunit√©, mais en me renseignant sur les proc√©dures de VISA, je me suis rendu compte que je devrais demander un VISA B1 pour pouvoir y assister.

Le probl√®me, c'est que d'apr√®s les informations que j'ai trouv√©es sur le site des services consulaires, le temps d'attente pour un entretien de VISA B1 est actuellement de 130 jours !!! Cela signifie que, logiquement, je n'aurais jamais mon VISA √† temps pour d√©but d√©cembre‚Ä¶

Je voulais donc savoir si certains d'entre vous ont d√©j√† fait une demande de VISA B1 r√©cemment.

Honest mistake.

The controller asked for 50 Euro and I did not want to pay it so I started stalling, she took my name from my transport card and I gave her my correct date and country of birth. (I was born outside of France)

When she asked for my photo ID and means of payment I started rooting through my backpack. She asked for my address and I just gave her the town and told her that I just moved to Paris recently so I would have to look on my lease to get the exact address as I did not remember it.

After a few minutes of fake rooting through my bag, she had to leave, so she printed me a paper fine receipt and told me it is 100 EUR and then she got off the train.

Now here is the question, if I don't pay it, will they be able to find me? They have my (accurate): name, date and country of birth and the approximate town of my current residence. My yearly pass is a student one so all they have from me in their system is my school enrolment certificate from last year. (No longer studying at this school).

Any help would be appreciated and thanks in advance."

1fnp5oc,Gare du Nord - Comment s‚Äôy rendre sereinement ?,2024-09-23 16:48:15,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/voyageons/comments/1fnp5oc/gare_du_nord_comment_sy_rendre_sereinement/,"Bonjour √† tous ! 

Un peu de contexte, je (M23) vais devoir me rendre √† la Gare du Nord la semaine prochaine afin me rendre √† Lille une journ√©e pour le travail. Je prendrai le train vers 7h45. Le soir j‚Äôarriverai √† la Gare du Nord vers 22h. 

J‚Äôai subi deux agressions particuli√®rement violentes (attaque au tournevis et une attaque au couteau) et je garde des s√©quelles de ces agressions. Dans les lieux ¬´¬†dangereux¬†¬ª √† l‚Äôimage de la Gare du Nord, j‚Äôai des mont√©es d‚Äôangoisses terrible √† l‚Äôid√©e de revivre quelque chose de similaire. √áa me paralyse totalement. 

Habitant dans l‚Äôouest Parisien, je me demandais quel √©tait le moyen le plus safe // tranquille d‚Äôesprit pour me rendre Gare du Nord ? Je pensais prendre un Uber/Taxi le matin mais pour le retour le soir, j‚Äôai peur de devoir attendre √† l‚Äôext√©rieur de la gare et je me demande si je ne suis pas mieux √† prendre le m√©tro ? 

Merci d‚Äôavance pour votre retour ! 

NB : je ne me suis jamais rendu √† la Gare du Nord, mais l‚Äôimage qu‚Äôon m‚Äôen a d√©peint me p√©trifie √† l‚Äôid√©e de m‚Äôy rendre."

J'ai besoin de conseils pour une situation assez emb√™tante. 
Je vais voyager avec mon p√®re de fin mai √† d√©but juin au Japon (Tokyo - Gifu - Kyoto puis re Tokyo). Je compte prendre une valise soute et un sac √† dos et mon p√®re pareil. J'aimerai laisser √† Tokyo les grosses valises et ne pendre justement que le sac √† dos pour la partie Kyoto etc parce que pour le shinkansen je sens que cela va √™tre COMPLIQU√â en ayant d√©j√† v√©cu la situation avec une petite valise il y a deux ans c'√©tait p√©nible de se la trimbaler partout quand on changeait de destination.

Je partirai de Tokyo pour y revenir environ 6 jours plus tard. Alors voil√† je sais qu'il  existe plusieurs solutions, mais je pr√©f√®re si possible utiliser celle des coin lockers ou du Airbnb/hotel (qu'ils la gardent en attendant notre retour). 

Mais est ce qu'l est possible de laisser au propri√©taire les valises et revenir plus tard dans le m√™me airbnb/h√¥tel pour qu'il les gardent en attendant ?
Et sinon est ce que les coin lockers peuvent √™tre utilis√©s pour un si long temps et si oui connaissez vous les enndroits o√π cela est possible ?

1feaw9d,Les bases de l'eSIM pour les voyages internationaux,2024-09-11 14:02:35,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/voyageons/comments/1feaw9d/les_bases_de_lesim_pour_les_voyages_internationaux/,"Utiliser une eSIM a compl√®tement chang√© la donne pour moi. Voici un retour bas√© sur mes exp√©riences et aussi pourquoi je pense que √ßa peut servir √† tout le monde pour de futurs voyages.

**Le V√©ritable Avantage des eSIMs**

Elles vous permettent d'√©viter les frais d'itin√©rance (√ßa revient bien moins cher que le hors-forfait) et les forfaits data eSIM sont bien moins chers que ceux propos√©s par les op√©rateurs.Vous conservez votre num√©ro de t√©l√©phone et vous ajoutez juste un forfait de data (4G / 5G) pour votre voyage sur votre t√©l√©phone.En plus, ne pas avoir de SIM physique signifie faire un petit geste pour la plan√®te. Le meilleur dans tout √ßa c‚Äôest qu‚Äô√† peine vous atterrissez, vous √™tes d√©j√† connect√©. Plus besoin du Wi-Fi de l'a√©roport.

**Conseils de voyages :**

* Pour commencer, assurez-vous que votre t√©l√©phone prend en charge les eSIM (pas besoin du meilleur Smartphone, mais il faut v√©rifier)
* Gardez votre num√©ro habituel pour les appels et utilisez l‚ÄôeSIM pour les donn√©es, c‚Äôest super pratique et vous pouvez faire vos appels via WhatsApp, Facetime, Messenger, Viber, etc‚Ä¶
* Surveillez votre consommation de donn√©es de temps en temps, √ßa peut partir tr√®s vite lorsqu‚Äôon voyage (Story, Appels, etc‚Ä¶) et choisissez le forfait qui vous convient.
* Le Wi-Fi pourrait vous sauver si vous n‚Äôavez pas de r√©seau, cherchez toujours un endroit ayant une bonne connexion WiFi en cas de besoin.
* Prenez un peu de temps pour comparer les meilleurs forfaits eSIM - certaines ont des frais cach√©s ou des r√®gles strictes li√©es √† l‚Äôannulation, et une simple recherche peut vous √©viter des tracas pendant le voyage.

**Ma recommandation :**

Personnellement, au fil des voyages, j'ai essay√© plusieurs fournisseurs eSIM, et voici mes meilleures recommandations pour vos voyages (+ les codes de r√©duction que j‚Äôai d√©j√† v√©rifi√©) :

* **Saily** : (15% de r√©duction avec le code ""SAILY15OFF"").

Super facile √† configurer et j'ai toujours eu un tr√®s bon r√©seau quand je l‚Äôai utilis√©. Ils ont des offres courtes et longues dur√©es pour tous les voyages. Gardez en t√™te que 1Go √ßa part vite, mais c‚Äôest super simple pour recharger.

* **Airalo** : (10% de r√©duction avec le code ""SALLY10"").

Airalo est top pour les pays disponibles, il est tr√®s pratique et fonctionne bien. Par contre, le prix peut parfois √™tre un peu plus √©lev√© par rapport √† d'autres fournisseurs, ce qui est √† prendre en compte.

* **Airhub** :(5% de r√©duction avec le code ""TD05"").

Airhub est vraiment pratique aussi, son application est facile √† utiliser, mais j'ai remarqu√© que leur service client peut mettre un peu plus de temps √† r√©pondre, ce qui n‚Äôest pas top pendant un voyage.

Et voil√† ! N‚Äôh√©sitez pas √† ajouter d‚Äôautres astuces si vous en connaissez. Faisons en sorte que ce soit utile pour tous."

Je me tourne vers vous pour obtenir des conseils, car je me trouve √† un tournant de ma vie et j‚Äôai besoin de perspectives ext√©rieures. Je travaille actuellement comme Responsable Marketing et Communication dans l‚Äôindustrie h√¥teli√®re de luxe, un poste prestigieux qui m‚Äôoffre de nombreuses opportunit√©s professionnelles. Cependant, je me sens √©puis√©e, vid√©e, et j‚Äôai l‚Äôimpression d‚Äô√™tre press√©e comme un citron. Mon travail me demande beaucoup, et je ne trouve plus vraiment de sens √† ce que je fais.

√Ä 29 ans, j‚Äôenvisage s√©rieusement de tout quitter pour partir en woofing √† travers l‚ÄôEurope et le Canada pendant environ 6 mois. Mon objectif est de me ressourcer, de me reconnecter avec la nature, et de retrouver un √©quilibre que je n‚Äôarrive plus √† maintenir dans mon travail actuel. Ce projet m‚Äôattire √©norm√©ment, mais je dois aussi prendre en compte que je n‚Äôai pas de famille sur qui compter, ce qui ajoute une dimension de risque √† ma d√©cision.

Pour ajouter un peu de contexte, je suis dans ce poste depuis trois mois, et bien que j‚Äôaie acquis une exp√©rience pr√©cieuse, la charge de travail intense a s√©rieusement impact√© mon bien-√™tre. Je me demande si cela vaut la peine de continuer un peu plus longtemps ou si je devrais sauter le pas maintenant, vu l‚Äô√©puisement que je ressens.

Voici quelques points sur lesquels j‚Äôaimerais vos avis :

* **Est-il insens√© de vouloir tout quitter pour ce genre de projet, surtout sans soutien familial ?**
* **Comment puis-je g√©rer cette transition financi√®rement et personnellement ?**
* **Certains d'entre vous ont-ils d√©j√† fait quelque chose de similaire, et quels conseils pourriez-vous me donner pour pr√©parer ce voyage tout en minimisant les risques ?**
* **Comment m'assurer que cette d√©cision ne compromettra pas ma carri√®re √† long terme ?**

Je suis √† un point o√π le burn-out me guette, et j‚Äôai vraiment besoin de prendre du recul. Merci d‚Äôavance pour tous les conseils et les exp√©riences que vous pourrez partager."

Cette ann√©e, pour des raisons persos, je (M32) voyage seul. Je visite la Bretagne depuis 5 jours et pour encore 3 jours.

J'ai suivi les conseils d'amis : j'ai pris tous mes logements en auberge de jeunesse, pour rencontrer du monde.

Et j'ai suivi un auto-conseil qui me paraissait intelligent (spoiler alert, √ßa l'√©tait pas) : voyager d√©but septembre pour √©viter le rush et la surpopulation touristique. √áa marche bien : les restos sont rarement complet, les chemins de rando sont en effet pas trop surcharg√©s, je fais pas la queue pendant 1000 ans avant de visiter le moindre truc genre Mont Saint-Michel... (c'est pas la Bretagne, je sais, jouez pas sur les mots !)

Mais alors par contre dans les auberges de jeunesse, y a pas un rat. C'est ma 5√®me nuit ce soir, et ma 3√®me auberge, et c'est toujours la m√™me chose : je suis seul dans le dortoir. Je pensais pas qu'y aurait si peu de monde d√©but septembre. Je pensais √©viter le rush, pas me retrouver dans le d√©sert social.

Pour √™tre plus pr√©cis, y a un peu de monde dans les auberges : tous des retrait√©s. Et en vrai, je parle un peu avec eux. Mais moi qui esp√©rais rencontrer du monde de mon √¢ge (et je pensais m√™me √™tre un peu vieux pour les AJ), c'est la douche froide... 

Du coup, je fais tout tout seul. Je m'imaginais par exemple √™tre dans un dortoir de 5, et qu'il y aurait 1 ou 2 autres personnes qui avaient pr√©vu de faire tel ou tel truc touristique, et du coup on l'aurait fait ensemble. Que nenni. La solitude.

Bref, du coup si dans mon cas pr√©cis vous auriez des conseils pour la fin de mon s√©jour, je suis preneur."

Et bien s√ªr, le tout avec mes jambes, et tout le strict n√©cessaire pour (sur)vivre le temps donn√©.
Je suis donc √† la recherche d‚Äô√©ventuel.les partenaires (et m√™me d‚Äôami.es) qui seraient partant.es !

La demande est tr√®s sp√©ciale, mais j‚Äôaimerai sinc√®rement trouver quelqu‚Äôun comme moi, attir√© par la complexit√©, mais surtout par la beaut√© de la nature :)

Bon, je dois finir par l'avouer : j'ai besoin d'aide !

J'ai 22 ans, j'ai jamais voyag√© seul de ma vie. Je suis parti une fois en vend√©e avec des amis et c'est tout. La, pour f√©vrier, on aimerais se faire un voyage avec mes fr√®res. On aimerais partir un peu vers l'inconnu, avoir un premier ""vrai"" voyage √† nous. On a nos passeports, des dates (sur les vacances scolaires pour mon plus petit fr√®re), un budget, petit mais qu'on peut ajuster pis on a pas des gouts de luxe.

Je suis le plus vieux et l'id√©e vient de moi donc j'essaie d‚Äôorganiser un minimum le truc pour proposer des id√©es... et le je suis perdu ! C'est pas la premi√®re fois que √ßa m'arrive : je veut partir, je pose des jours, je regarde mon budget et je cherche. Je stress, je sais pas par quel bout prendre le truc, je panique, j'annule.

Concr√®tement ma question porte sur la pr√©paration d'un voyage, comment on fait ? On regarde quoi d'abord, on cale quoi d'abord ?

La dans l'id√©e on a :

.Le budget,  
.Les dates,  
.Les participants,  
.La ville de d√©part (Nantes pour se rejoindre, sinon d√©part de Pornichet pour un, de Pornic pour un autre pis d'un village pour le dernier),  
.Des id√©es : Partir √† Londres une semaine, aller √† la neige, voyager dans un pays europ√©en pour d√©couvrir un peu √† l'aveugle...  
.Certain contraintes : j'utilise pas ma voiture (car grand stress√© avec √ßa et √ßa me g√¢cherais les vacances).

Maintenant bah je sais pas quoi faire. Par exemple si on se d√©cide pour Londres. Est-ce que je valide d'abord le train (billets pas encore dispo pour Nantes-Paris-Londres), est ce que je regarde l'hotel, est ce que... Je ne sais pas !

Est-ce que partir √† l'√©tranger sana voiture √ßa se fait? Prendre l'avion me fait un peu peur, arriver dans un a√©roport, devoir prendre et d√©pendre d'une navette payante pour aller en ville et pas louper l'avion retour.

Bref, je suis perdu face √† ce projet et j'aimerais ne pas laisser tomber maintenant que j'ai annoncer un voyage √† mes fr√®res donc si quelqu'un a des conseils je suis preneur ! Si vous avez des pistes sinon pour des inspirations de programme de voyages je prends aussi (oui √ßa me d√©prime de devoir utiliser √ßa mais si √ßa peut me d√©stresser au moins pour le premier d√©part, pourquoi pas !).

Je suis sur paris durant les JO.
Je suis √† saint Lazare dans les rues alentours et je prends les escaliers pour descendre au niveau du RER e.

Arriv√©e en haut des escaliers un homme m intercepte et m enpeche de valid√© les portillons du m√©tro. Il me dit qu il est contr√¥leur et il me prends mon pass qui √©tait dans ma main.
J ai un pass easy charg√© √† ce moment l√† de 9 tickets. D habitude je prends un pass mensuel mais au mois d' ao√ªt le pass easy correspondait plus √† mon besoin.
Je lui dit que je viens de commenc√© mon trajet et que le portillon √©tait ouvert je ne sais pas si sa la valid√© en revanche je ne fraude pas car je m appr√™te √† valider mes portillons du m√©tro et que pour moi sa compte comme un trajet donc que je le valide ou pas c est la m√™me chose pour moi.
Il me demande de lui r√©gler 50 euros en esp√®ces. Je n' ai pas assez d esp√®ce. Je lui demande d appeler ces coll√®gues pour v√©rifier la v√©racit√© de mes propos il refuse.
Je suis une personne malade avec un handicap je lui signale. Il appelle les gendarmes qui √©tait √† c√¥t√© de nous.
On rentre dans un film
Le contr√¥leur leur dit que il m'a emp√™ch√© de fraud√©, que je n'ai pas de titre de transport, que je suis dangereuse et arm√©.
Les gendarmes ne m ecoute pas. Il me brutalise, m humili√© me d√©chire mon t√¥t bag pour sortir l arme qui √©tait une petite bouteille d' eau mais bon comme personne ne m ecoute. Ils me tra√Ænent jusqu au commissariat de la gare du nord et je ressors avec un PV de 100 euros.
Je suis rest√©e tr√®s choqu√©e. Je ne comprends pas. Je vais me lancer dans le long parcours contestation, m√©diation mais je pense pas avoir gain de cause car je n' ai pas pens√© √† ce moment l√† √† retourne au portiques  pour filmer.
Je pense que c √©tait pour me faire peur mais les gendarmes m ont promis de me faire un casier et que j aurai un PV de 300 euros. C est eux qui ont √©t√© incorrect avec moi et pas l inverse.
Est ce que quelqu un aurait une solution ? Et je dois appuyer sur quels √©l√©ments dans la contestation.

Avez-vous utilis√© d'autres alternatives (agents r√©put√©s) pour obtenir un visa ?

Coucou, je viens d'avoir 24 ans et par la force des choses (et quelques erreurs de parcours) je commence ""seulement"" la vie d'adulte. Mais j'ai pas trop trop envie de commencer tout de suite, je viens de terminer mon contrat d'apprentissage de pr√©parateur en pharmacie, √ßa para√Æt pas incroyable comme √ßa mais je vous promets que ces 2 ans de formation ont √©t√© vraiment tr√®s tr√®s intenses et j'ai d√©j√† bien satur√©. 

J'ai eu la chance d'avoir pu mettre un peu d'argent de c√¥t√© (quelques milliers, rien de bien dingue non plus), et j'ai envie d'√™tre √©go√Øste et m'en servir pour voyager un peu dans l'ann√©e qui va suivre avant de reprendre ce rythme infernal que peut √™tre la pharmacie. 

J'ai jamais voyag√© uniquement par moi-m√™me et j'ai pas encore le permis, mais je me sens pas sp√©cialement limit√© par √ßa. Je veux pas partir en vacances, je veux voyager, marcher, faire du stop, gal√®rer, d√©couvrir le monde, voir de nouveaux paysages et rencontrer des nouvelles personnes/cultures pour mon d√©veloppement personnel ! bref je cherche un peu l'aventure 

J'ai pas de destination particuli√®re mais j'ai toujours eu tr√®s envie de visiter le grand Nord, j'envisage d'aller en Islande, Ecosse ou peut √™tre Norv√®ge/Su√®de voire m√™me l'Arctique.

Je pars fin du mois pour un voyage de 3 mois en Asie du Sud Est : Vietnam > Cambodge > Thailande.

Je fais un aller-retour vers Bangkok, o√π je passe 3 jours. J'ai d√©j√† r√©serv√© un billet BKK > HAN.

- 1 vol Hanoi > Phnom Penh

- 1 vol Da Nang > Phnom Penh

- 1 bus de Ho Chi Minh > Phnom Penh.



Il m'est donc difficile de pr√©senter un billet de sortie de territoire.

Pensez-vous que Vietnam Airlines est tr√®s regardant l√†-dessus ? Sinon, est-ce qu'un e-visa pour le Cambodge pr√©sent√© √† la compagnie avec une date prouvant que je reste - de 1 mois au Vietnam suffirait ?

En pleine organisation d'un voyage en Islande d√©but d√©cembre et ayant fait la finlande l'ann√©e derni√®re ,j'ai plusieurs interrogations.

D'apr√®s ce que j'ai pu lire lors de mes recherches, √† cette p√©riodes de l'ann√©e, rester dans le sud est conseill√© en partie √† cause de la m√©t√©o et donc de l'√©tat des routes.

En Finlande j'avais conduit une citadine et je n'avais eu aucun soucis, je vois sur les sites de location en Islande que c'est majoritairement des petit SUV, c'est obligatoire l√† bas en hiver ? 

Est ce que les visites/excursions sont faisables facilement sans passer par une agence ? 
J'avoue avoir √©t√© d√©√ßu d'√™tre pass√© par une agence pour une bonne partie de celle que j'ai effectu√© en Finlande, parcours majoritairement simple, et effectu√© lentement (forc√©ment on s'adapte au groupe) et relativement press√© par le temps. Et le seul √©quipement n√©cessaire √©tait des raquettes ou des crampons (qui se louait facilement). 
Je pense √† des excursions entre autres de visite de glacier,  de grotte de glace, du cercle d'or.

Je suis peut √™tre passer √† c√¥t√© mais j'ai l'impression qu'il n'est pas possible de louer une motoneige pour la journ√©e, qu'il faut forc√©ment passer par un tour guid√© ?

Et dernier point (pour le moment), j'esp√©rai trouver du karting sur glace, j'ai trouv√© √ßa tellement dr√¥le en Finlande, mais encore une fois, sauf si je suis pass√© √† c√¥t√©, √ßa n'existe pas.
