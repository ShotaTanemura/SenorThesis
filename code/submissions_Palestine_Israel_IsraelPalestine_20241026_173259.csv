**Excerpt from introduction by Ryan Grim:**    
      
Journalists Younis Tirawi and Sami Vanderlip have managed to find and archive all the Instagram stories and daily posts shared by the soldiers of one key unit, Israel‚Äôs 749 Combat Engineering Battalion. They‚Äôve mapped out the structure of the unit and identified the individual soldiers and officers involved, along with their various roles in operations. They have tracked the activities of each company in the battalion, including what they were doing, when, and where, as the force shred their way through Gaza.   
   
The mission is nothing less than a systematic, concerted, and deliberate effort to erase the intellectual, cultural, and social future of the Palestinian people. ‚ÄúOur job is to flatten Gaza,‚Äù the soldiers of the official D9 company of the battalion wrote on their Instagram page. They added, accurately: ‚ÄúNo one will stop us.‚Äù¬†   
   
You likely heard about some of the atrocities described in this article in real time... now you can see it from the perspective of those carrying out and reveling in them...    
   
The following is a thorough account of the acts committed by the 749 battalion, complete with the evidence they post themselves [Images & Videos]. These are not just isolated events, but represent a pattern that runs through the very heart of the Israeli military‚Äîa sadistic attitude toward the civilians of Gaza, whose futures they have been tasked with blowing up or flattening. If sadistic sounds harsh, read through this dispatch and ask yourself if it‚Äôs not, in the end, too soft of a description.

1gc6jh1,"29 top accomplishment of ""Israel"" in 2024. (Not OP.)",2024-10-25 22:28:14,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1gc6jh1/29_top_accomplishment_of_israel_in_2024_not_op/,"This is a summary of the effects Israel has had in the region and around the world this year. Full credit to Arch Bungle at M ‚ôæÔ∏è n 0 f Ala b. AMA.

What has Israel achieved in the last year?
Let's take a stone cold sober recap, I've compiled a list of the top 29 accomplishments of Israel in 2024:


**1. Israel has essentially lost territory in the north of Occupied Palestine.** Hezbollah's rocket barrages over the last eleven months has driven the settler population out of the North. This is likely permanent. Israel's settler population in the Gaza envelope has also been thinned out since the 7 October attacks.
Moreover, current ongoing attacks from Yemen, Iraq, Iran and Lebanon are depopulating Israel.

**2. The Houthi have put an unbreakable chokehold on the Red Sea and all Red Sea shipping.** There is no way to break this chokehold. The USN and all other Western navies have tried for almost 12 months and failed utterly.

Attempts to conduct strikes on the Houthi, including massive strikes on core infrastructure in Hodeida have yielded ZERO results over a period of almost a year. The Israelis are to thank for this achievement.

**3. The cementing of Hezbollah as the primary military force in Lebanon:** Hezbollah's Radwan forces have proven capable of protecting Lebanon's southern borders with Palestine. All attempts by the IDF and their supporting American Special Forces to take control of this area and drive the Radwan forces back have failed.

**4. The ensured survival of Hamas:** Hamas in the Gaza strip persists after almost a year. For months they've demonstrated ability to strike IDF forces daily, destroying IDF ground equipment and troops. This is true, even if incremental in nature. Hamas is still able to launch rockets on the Gaza envelope.

This means their rocket manufacturing facilities are still functional. Hamas has demonstrated staying power and resilience. Compared to Fatah in the West Bank, Hamas has demonstrated an ability and willingness to actualize the Palestinian desire for self determination.

Due to Israel's excessive response to 7 October, Fatah has been permanently sidelined. Hamas will forever be known as the true face of Palestinian resistance.

**5. The validation of Hezbollah's resilience:** Despite eliminating one (1) component of the Hezbollah leadership, Hezbollah has reconstituted its leadership structure. It's most senior leadership council, the Shura is still intact.

Despite a technically brilliant infiltration of the communications infrastructure supply chain by Israel and after a massive air strike involving rarely used bunker buster missiles, Israel has failed to dent the combat capability or even morale of Hezbollah.

**6. Hezbollah has established, for the first time in history, a buffer zone cleared of Israelis within the held territory of 'Israel' (Occupied Palestine).**

**7. Recent and previous strikes carried out by the IRGC on Tel Aviv showed the failure of the Iron Dome and the failure of ALL Israel's air defense systems.** David's Sling. Arrow. Patriot. Moreover, the air defense systems of Israel's satraps (Jordan) were also proven to fail. Further, the interception systems of the USN were proven to be inadequate.

This has massive implications for war-gaming a conflict between the US and Iran. It means that the US will have to consider the fact that regardless of what it may inflict on Iran, it will not be able to shield anyone and itself against a concurrent Iranian retaliation.
Moreover, the US must now acknowledge that Iran has the ability to destroy it's carrier groups.

Marine power projection is therefore no longer of any use in the Persian Gulf, Indian Ocean, Red Sea, Gulf of Oman ... It must now recalculate all it's previous attack plans.

**8. The hardening of Hezbollah positions in the South of Lebanon:** Despite the spectacular and tragic strikes Israel has carried out on Beirut the essential damage is limited to civilian blocks and civilian villages in the south. It appears that very little of Israel's considerable air firepower has harmed Hezbollah itself. Hezbollah not only remains lodged there but the creation of rubble and destruction has provided them future cover and shelter.

The net effect of these strikes has been to galvanize Hezbollah's fighters, drive Hezbollah recruitment, set world opinion firmly against Israel. The global environment for Israelis, Zionists and sadly, even non-Zionist Jews has been polluted on account of Netanyahu's actions in Beirut.

On the other side of the equation, the IDF has wasted substantial amounts of materiel on killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure. Infrastructure which has nothing to do with the threat posed by Hezbollah.

While the US has put its entire arsenal at Israel's disposal these materials are far from infinite and will run out soon - or become so expensive that it begins place further pressures on the U.S economy and logistics chains.

**9. The US' ongoing Iraq Occupation is coming apart at the seams:** Despite the US presence in Iraq, it is demonstrably unable to exert any influence on the Iraqi resistance movements there, who launch increasingly sophisticated missile and drone attacks from Iraqi territory under the noses of US garrisons.

In addition, the behavior of Israel has stimulated anti-US activity in Iraq and will shortly result in a violent ejection of U.S forces from that country regardless of the current puppet government's attempts to retain the U.S presence. It may take years to complete but the ejection of American forces from Iraq is all but assured now that the Hashds have demonstrated the ability to use substantial lethal force.

**10. The Syrian occupation is coming apart at the seams:** Strikes against U.S bases in Syria have become a weekly occurrence now. The resistance movements in Syria have shown that they have the capability to put American bases under constant pressure. The U.S will shortly lose it's comfortable perch on the Conoco oil fields in Syria and with it, control of the spigot to the various anti-government militant movements in the region ... and with that, control of Syria. Turkey and Russia have become confident to bomb ISIS and Kurdish proxies in Syria.

In short, Israel's needless bloodlust has imperiled the US' ongoing occupation of the entire Middle East.

**11. Israel has destabilized Jordan.** Iran has pushed Jordan (and others) into showing their cards at the middle eastern poker table. The government of Jordan has been exposed as a completely controlled satrap of Israel. Its national interests are completely subordinate to Israel and the USA above and beyond the interests of Jordanian people.
This begins the countdown to the end of the regime of King Abdullah of Jordan and his administration.

**12. Israel has sown the seeds of destabilization in Egypt.** Iran has pushed Jordan and Egypt into showing their cards at the middle eastern poker table. Egypt has been exposed as a complete satrap of the US and Israel, completely subordinate to the needs of the Zionist entity. Every Egyptian, with warm memories of Gamal Abdel Nasser would probably be weeping at this point.

The only thing that keeps the Egyptian population from toppling their government at this time is the Egyptian military. It will unfortunately remain so until the right catalyst arrives to light the spark of revolution ...

However, the net result of all these increasing strains within Egypt is to increase sympathies for the Palestinian people, opening up smuggling lines into Gaza.

**13. The perception of Western Moral and Civilizational Superiority has been utterly destroyed.** The fact that Western Colonialism is alive and well and that Western Civilization is morally bankrupt has been been exposed to the Global South.

This moral bankruptcy has been manifested firstly at the level of it's governments and secondly at the level of it's apathetic populations who support the actions of their governments.

The result of this is that the Global South is now able to weaponize diplomacy in every forum with Western powers.

In the past, every diplomatic discourse between Western powers and non-Western countries used to begin with brow-beating and embarrassment of those countries around their human rights records.
Today, every diplomatic discourse between the West and a global south nation begins with a refutation of Western moral high ground. The recent BRICS conference in Kazan underscores this.

**14. The neutralization of weaponize Western sanctions:** Israel's actions, triggering Iran's, Yemen's and Hezbollah's actions have revealed that western sanctions against The Middle Eastern Resistance have been useless in stopping the technological and military advance of these powers.

Moreover, these sanctions have served to push the middle east into the BRICS trade sphere and away from the G7 trading sphere. It is a self-strangulation of the Western economies carried out by the USA on behalf of it's garrison in Occupied Palestine.

Ultimately, these sanctions backfired spectacularly, resulting effectively in the global sanction and blockade of Western shipping through the Red Sea and ""tit-for tat"" oil tanker confiscations in the Persian Gulf.

**15. The compromise of the integrity of Western Supply Chains.** The compromise of Western mobile device supply chains, which could only have happened through the collaboration of multiple Western states, including the collusion of parties in Taiwan (outside of the control of Beijing) and Hong Kong (controlled loosely by Beijing) has resulted in complete loss of trust in Western telecommunications equipment and alerted Beijing and Moscow to potential compromise in their own supply chains.

While the implications of this are still unfolding the future success of western exports and Israel's inclusion in the supply chains are now in question.

China is now, even more than before, not only the ""supplier of volume"" but also the ""supplier of trust"".

**16. Due to the actions of Israel, the US has been exposed to its people and the UN community (UNSC, UNGA) as completely under control of the Zionist Lobby.** It is no longer a government of the people by the people (if ever it was!). In the past, it was suspected that Israel had some influence over American foreign and home policy, but now it is certain that Israel controls American foreign policy in totality. The question of which part of the dog is the tail and which the dog has become meaningless - it's all ""dog"". Moreover, this compromise of the State, the subversion of Western governments to the purposes of the Zionist lobby, has been repeated on other Western governments like Germany, France, Britain.

We have just witnessed the destruction of 'Pax' Americana and its replacement by 'Pax' Judaica. Thus, the prediction of Sheikh Imran Hossein has been fulfilled.

**17. Well done on the genocide front!** Israel has progressed quite far in it's genocide of the Gazan Palestinian population within the last 12 months. The depopulation of the Gaza strip is well on it's way by means of sickness, starvation more than missiles and bombs.

For this there will be a price to pay in the eyes of history, for the Zionists if Israel have provided the excuse (not justification) for some enterprising tyrant to commit future persecutions and genocides against the Jews - and others.

**18. Israeli economy is destroyed along multiple vectors for the foreseeable future.** MNCs with offices in Israel have been negatively impacted. Affected business range from individual companies that cannot operate in Israel anymore due to instability and loss of workforce, to larger corporations whose ethical compliance measures require them to decouple from Israel. The impact extends to companies that cannot tolerate the disruption to energy infrastructure and logistics lines.

**19. New, persistent threats that cannot be remedied by the West have been created.** The Houthi and the Iraqi Hashds being one case in point.

There's just no end in sight here. These actors are going to be around for years, threatening the viability of Israel as a ""peaceful place for the Jews"" and turning it into merely another American garrison in the Levant.

**20. Degraded Israeli gas and Oil infrastructure in the Mediterranean.** Recent strikes have not only destroyed some of Israel's gas platforms in the Med but demonstrated that Iran has the ability to wipe out Israel's energy infrastructure. Israel will now have to recalculate the security of its energy supply. Any customers of Israel's gas and oil production will have to recalculate their energy security equations.

**21. Ensured continuity of the Resistance.** The further radicalization of Hezbollah by removal of the conservative elder leadership has resulted in the younger, more aggressive, less restrained commanders to take the lead. Moreover, the remaining elder leadership in the Shura council have been painfully reminded that there is no negotiating with the Israelis and the Americans and that the only way out is to fight.

The murder of national heroes like Hassan Nasrallah has very likely galvanized the youth of Lebanon.

In a similar vein, the next generation of Hamas and Al Qassam fighters, now still children, have been created in the camps of Gaza, the West Bank, Ein Al Hilwe and other Lebanese Palestinian camps and the Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan and Syria.

This is the primary reason for the American and Israeli murder campaign against Palestinian children and babies.

**22. A distraction for the USA and the Western Imperium:** Ultimately the debacle in Occupied Palestine, engineered and sustained by Benjamin Netanyahu has posed a major drain on American resources.

It is a distraction from confronting bigger, more threatening adversaries like China and Russia.

The more cognitive energy, financial resources and political capital the USA has tied up in the Middle East conflict, the less it has left to confront serious developments on the Russia and China fronts.

The BRI, for example continues apace. Chinese and Russian space and marine developments proceed by leaps and bounds. Chinese chip manufacture has reached the 7 nm scale and 4 nm is in testing. Hypersonic missile development in Russia and China has outpaced American developments by leaps and bounds. China has achieved a 6g Transmission network implementation. China operates the biggest space station human kind has ever deployed.

**23. The UN has been exposed as an impotent and in fact detrimental organization:** Israel, through it's own behavior at the UN has exposed the entire organization, from the ICC, ICJ, UNSC, UNGA and even organizations like UNRWA as completely impotent for all tasks that do not support the interests of the Western Powers. While this has been obvious since the comprise of the OPCW some years ago, the rot has been exposed at all levels of the UN and repeatedly hammered home by the Israeli representatives at the UN.

Nobody can ignore it anymore, nobody other than those benefiting from the grift.

**24. It Bleeds:** The vulnerability of Israel, it's economy, it's military and it's allies has been exposed by non-state actors who have now demonstrated that they are able to keep this so called regional 'superpower' bleeding for a straight year while being severely under-supplied, outgunned, outnumbered.

Should other Arab countries decide at any point that Israel no longer serves their purposes in the Middle East, they've seen the evidence that Israel is not invincible and on the contrary, remarkably vulnerable.

**25. Weakening of the Lebanese, Iraqi, Syrian and Yemeni State is a Strengthening of Hezbollah and the Houthi Movement:** Israel, in taking the wrecking ball to Lebanese and Yemeni civilian government and sovereignty has created an environment in which the state will never be able to hold a monopoly on violence. The entire extent of Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen will therefore remain free and open for Hezbollah and Ansarallah to operate without government restraint. Even if this ""freedom"" is the freedom of chaos.

**26. It can be terrified into paralysis:** The delayed response of Israel to Iran's latest hypersonic attack has been uncharacteristic. It demonstrates that the mere use of violence is sufficient to paralyze not only the Israeli Occupation State Apparatus but also that of the wider Anglo-American Empire, which itself seems scared of retaliating directly against Iran.

**27. The World notes this.** For perhaps the first time in history, war crimes accusations leading to actual arrest warrants have been issued against Israeli individuals (by the ICJ). Yes, with much reluctance, but it indicates that even the Zionist dominated West is beginning to crack under the stress of it's own contradictions. These contradictions will merely expand further ...

**28. The utter failure of the Lebanon Ground invasion and discredit of the IDFs power:** It is clear that the IDF's ground invasion of Lebanon is a failure when compared with Israel's previous invasion and occupation of Beirut. In an era where the IDF/IOF should have enhanced military technology and training, the full support of the West, it's performance on the ground has only been a fraction of what it could once demonstrate. Even if the IDF/IOF ever manages to grind its way to Beirut, it will arrive there a bruised and battered remnant of itself. Then, the real war will begin ...

**29. The IDF/IOF and the so called 'State' of Israel has been exposed to be a fully dependent and indivisible organ of the American Empire:** The complete dependence on massive airlifts of American weapons, THAAD, American Political Intervention in the U.N and other arenas has exposed Israel as nothing without life support infrastructure provided by the Americans. The image of Israel as a viable future state for the Jews has thus been utterly shattered. It cannot exist for now or ever without Uncle Sam behind it. When the Empire Falls. Israel goes with it. Israel's enemies (and allies) will note this and plan accordingly.

How will all these ""sensitive initial conditions"" - these ""achievements"" - combine over the next 6 - 12 months to form greater unintended effects?

It's anyone's guess but the picture doesn't look good for Israel regardless of how it looks for the rest of the Levant.

I want you to think of the person you love the most, someone you'd put your life on the line for. And then imagine them in this situation we see livestreamd from Gaza. Because love isn't something only the free world gets to feel.

The limbs you see blown off in pictures every day, they were once held, caressed, they were used to hold someone's face, they were used to break bread in company of their loved ones, they were used to clap with delight, they were where someone else once found their whole world. This is just about hands. Every single body part you see blown apart, was moved in love, contentment and grief once.

A person's shredded hand doesn't change the fact that it belonged to a person. A human being capable of so much. All snatched by the cursed genocidal colonial entity that Zionist regime is.

Have you ever held a baby's hand? And felt how tightly their tiny fingers curl around yours? Those baby hands. Imagine them. And the love that fills all of your heart when you realise you will never know a love like this. And then imagine that someone has to collect their baby's dismembered body in a plastic bag.

Imagine your home. And the kind of effort you put into buying even a towel or a key holder. The number of shops you go to. The hours you spend online getting the aesthetic right. And then some foreign devil drops a bomb on your house. And all of it just gone. 

The windows you researched on and finally bought shattered. The door you closed on the outside world to finally relax, shattered.
That one beautiful crockery set you wash despite being exhausted after a day of hosting guests, smashed to smithereens.

If your heart isn't moved by the images from Gaza, I actually feel sad for your heart. I feel sad for the people you love. I feel sad for your conscience. Because have you ever even loved if you aren't moved and if you aren't in a constant state of rage?

Beyond that, an estimated 10,000 people are buried under rubble.

1gasfuf,"Resistance and Palestinian Christianity, are there Christians with the Resistance?",2024-10-24 02:38:23,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1gasfuf/resistance_and_palestinian_christianity_are_there/,"I was trying to know the same thing, so I did my research. Here is an overview of what I found.

First before talking about anything related to Hamas. We have to know Hamas is not what we used to think about. Hamas is a political organization based on democracy rather than an Islamist one. But it has its own military. There are too many groups like Hamas eg: PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine), PIJ (Palestine Islamic Jihad), DFLP (Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine), PRC (Popular Resistance Committees), etc. All of them have their own military unit. They work independently for the freedom of Palestine. Most of them are focused on secular or non-religious ideology rather than Islamic including Hamas. But since Oct 7 all these groups have been working under the umbrella of Hamas.

The interesting thing is PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine) was founded by a Christian (George Habash). ""Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades"" is their military wing. DFLP (Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine) was also founded by Christian (Nayef Hawatmeh). ""National Resistance Brigades"" or ""Martyr Omar Al-Qassem Forces"" is their military wing. The red color headbands are used by PFLP, the black ones are used by both DELP and PIJ, and the green and dark green-brown colors are used by Al-Qassam/Hamas. All of these groups were involved directly in the Oct 7 attack alongside Hamas. This shows that these groups have good connections with Hamas. But the question is are these groups still maintained by Christians? No, because of the small population of Christians in Palestine (1% of Gaza and 2-3% of West Bank) majority of its members are Muslims. So are there even a small amount of Christians in these groups now? Yes. Another group, Fatah/PLO (currently the govt of Palestine) is known to have a lot of Christians as its members. Till the Second Intifada, this group directly fought against Israel. And its military wing ""Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades"" (separated in 2007) was indeed present in the Oct 7 attack and still fighting. This explains the Christian and Muslim unity against occupation.

During a September 2, 1982 press conference at the United Nations, Yasser Arafat stated that:

>Jesus Christ was the first Palestinian fedayeen who carried his sword along the path on which the Palestinians today carry their cross.

*- The Dhimmi: Jews and Christians Under Islam. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press. p:145*

In an interview, Alastair Crooke speaks of his meeting with the founder of Hamas:

>""He said that Hamas is a liberation movement. He didn't say it was an Islamic movement, in fact he said it wasn't an Islamic movement, it was a liberation movement for people who are occupied, and he said so Christians can join it, Druze can join it, I could join Hamas if I want, as a liberation movement.

*- YouTube/judgingfreedom*

This explains that Hamas and other groups have positive views of others including Christians. What about Christians?

The co-founder of Palestinian American Churches for Peace said:

>he didn‚Äôt blame Hamas for their history of attacks against Israel.

*- Book, Palestinian Christians and Their Identity and Resistance in the 20th Century. p:115*

Archbishop Atallah Hanna (Theodosios), the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem maintains good relations with the resistance. He said:

>Israel has no right of claiming that we maintain relations with terrorist organizations because what Israel calls terrorist maybe to us nationalistic, freedom fighters.

*- Interview with Archmandrite Dr. Theodosios Attallah Hanna*

Father Manuel Mosallam, a Christian priest and head of the Department for the Christians of the Palestinian Foreign Office.

>He also urged the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Hamas to launch a compulsory military service scheme the Palestinian youth in order to establish a Palestinian army.

>‚ÄúThe Palestinian people are the decision makers,‚Äù the Palestinian official pointed out, stressing ‚Äúthe only solution is the resistance and civil disobedience.‚Äù

>He called on the Muslim countries to provide what he described as the Palestinians with the weapons that ‚Äúwould help them liberate Al-Aqsa.‚Äù

>On the two-state solution, Mosallam noted that ‚Äúthis project was over long time ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúPalestinians have no faith in anyone. They only trust in their weapons, resistance, and their blood,‚Äù he said.

*- Palestine Chronicle*

Personally, I have seen at least one on Twitter and one on Quora who claimed to be a Palestinian Christian. And they directly support Hamas. The one on Twitter was from Gaza, I used to follow him on Twitter but can't find him now. The other one on Quora wrote: (Ignore his bad English)

>But supporting Hamas maybe is, hamas is a group from gaza that is defending and works like a state in Gaza city and the state is officialy muslim such as the Hamas group by itself, so they are muslims yes, are they any christians fighting with Hamas? No, i don‚Äôt think so, who SUPPORT hamas? Definitely YES, because they are defending all of us in palestine and it‚Äôa them who bombs israel and staying for us so why would we not support them? Because they are against christians? No they aren‚Äôt, soooo easy to know it because i am arabic speaker and live with them so i think the media takes a big role in this case

Even though he can not be a verified and trusted source, but he talked about some important points: Are there any Christians who support Hamas? - Definitely YES. Are there any Christians fighting with Hamas? - No, he doesn't think so. (But his expression says it's not impossible)

So yeah, still most Christians support the resistance, even though most of the time they talk about non-violent resistance. But they generally support groups like Hamas. And indeed a small amount is still present in the resistance, but it's very hard to find them.

# Here is a breakdown of everything:

Are there Christians in Palestine?

\- Yes, but a very small population (1% of Gaza and 2-3% of West Bank).

Do they support the resistance?

\- Definitely YES.

Do they fight alongside the resistance?

\- Yes.

Are there any Christian majority resistance groups?

\- No.

Do Christians support Hamas?

\- Yes.

Are there Christians in Hamas?

\- No, most probably.

Can Christians join Hamas? Are they welcomed positively?

\- Yes.

So, where are Christians fighting as the resistance?

\- Most probably, PFLP, DFLP. These two groups were founded by Christians, and because of their secular understandings.

*Personal Conclusion: As a non-Palestinian and non-Christian living tens of thousands of kilometers away from Palestine, it is impossible to find those Christians who are part of the resistance.*"

Good things to keep in mind when dealing with pinkwashing!

One example:
In July 2023, a man who calls himself Mohammed was driving from the West Bank to Jerusalem with a Palestinian man he had met on Grindr. While Mohammed has a Jerusalem ID that allows him to travel freely between the Occupied Territories and Israel, he must still pass through checkpoints upon entry and exit. When he arrived at the Al Jeeb checkpoint with his partner, he was stopped by an Israeli soldier who asked him to open his phone for a security check. Mohammed complied, telling the soldier, ‚ÄúYou can check my car. You can check me. There‚Äôs nothing,‚Äù he said. The soldier then turned to Mohammed and pointed to the Grindr icon. ‚ÄúNo, you have this application here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not good.‚Äù

For five hours, Mohammed and his partner were held in custody. An Israeli official scrolled through his chats and intimate pictures on Grindr and asked him about encounters with other Palestinians, Mohammed said. He asked Mohammed to work as a collaborator, offering him payments in shekels and promising not to arrest him. When Mohammed refused, Israeli soldiers beat him for two hours."

Then Katie talks to Rami Younis, a Palestinian writer, journalist, activist and co-director of ""[Lyd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LypAVlUCUpM),"" a science fiction documentary he co-directed about the once-thriving Palestinian city of Lyd. Rami reacts to Israel's recent decision to ban the film.    
   
Maura Finkelstein is a writer, ethnographer, and associate professor of anthropology. She is the author of The Archive of Loss: Lively Ruination in Mill Land Mumbai, published by Duke University Press in 2019. Her writing has also been published in Anthological Quarterly, City and Society, Cultural Anthropology, Anthropology Now, Post45, Electric Literature, Allegra Lab, Red Pepper Magazine, The Markaz Review, the Scottish Left Review, Mondoweiss, and Al Jazeera. She has been nominated for a Pushcart (2021), was a finalist for the Witness literary award (2022), was a Tin House Scholar (2023), and was recently the recipient of the 2024 New Directions Award from the General Anthropology Division (GAD) of the American Anthropological Association.      
    
Rami Younis is a Palestinian filmmaker, writer, journalist and activist from Lyd. He was a 2019-20 Fellow at the Harvard Divinity School. As a journalist, he mainly wrote for the online magazine +972 and served as both writer and editor of its Hebrew sister site, ‚Äúlocal call‚Äù, a journalistic project he co-founded, designed to challenge Israeli mainstream journalism outlets. Rami served as a parliamentary consultant and media spokesperson for Palestinian member of Knesset (Israeli parliament) Haneen Zoabi. Rami is also co-founder and manager of the first ever ‚ÄúPalestine Music Expo‚Äù: an event that connects local Palestinian music scene to the world wide industry. Younis was the host of the Arabic-language daily news show, ‚ÄúOn the Other Hand.""     
    
Lyd is a feature-length, sci-fi documentary that shares multiple pasts, presents, and futures of the city of Lyd in Palestine/Israel. From the perspective of the city herself, voiced by Palestinian actress Maisa Abd Elhadi, the viewer is guided through the lifespan of a five-thousand-year-old city and its residents. Lyd was once a thriving Palestinian city with a rich history. In 636AD, It was even considered the first capital of Palestine. When the State of Israel was founded in 1948, Lyd became an Israeli city, and in the process, hundreds of Lyd‚Äôs Palestinian residents were massacred by Israeli forces, and most of the city‚Äôs 50,000 Palestinian residents were exiled. Today, the city has a Jewish Israeli majority and a Palestinian minority and is disinvested and divided by racism and violence. For Palestinians, Lyd‚Äôs story is a painful and tragic fall from grace, which is why the film dares to ask the question: what would the city be like had the Israeli occupation of Lyd never happened?    
   
Using never-before-seen archival footage of the Israeli soldiers who carried out the massacre and expulsion, the city explains that these events were so devastating that they fractured her reality, and now there are two Lyds ‚Äì‚Äì one occupied and one free. As the film unfolds, documentary portions follow a chorus of characters through their daily lives, creating a tapestry of the Palestinian experience of this city, and vivid animations use the language of speculative fiction to envision an alternate reality where the same documentary characters live free from the trauma of the past and the violence of the present. As the film cuts between fantastical and documentary realities, it ultimately leaves the viewer questioning which future should prevail."

They interrogated his colleague. It turned out the deceased was tasked with driving a bulldozer. His colleague is quoted saying that they were forced to run over people, dead and alive, in the hundreds.

The good thing is that the article begins with a warning that there might be disturbing details for readers. What's shocking though is that it is not about the horror of the trucks squashing people, no, rather about the story of the suicide of the soldiers.

To be fair, the colleague called them terrorists, not people. So it's fair game I guess.

**It was only their machines: on Yahya Sinwar‚Äôs last stand**

Yahya Sinwar's last stand laid bare Israel's weakness, exposing the truth about its post-heroic army that only survives from a distance and remains shielded by armor, unwilling to face its enemies head-on.

By Abdaljawad Omar October 21, 2024 

When the Israeli soldiers believed they had found Yahya Sinwar‚Äôs body lying before them, they rushed to release the photos. Here, at last, was the image of victory, a portrait of conquest and proof of Israel‚Äôs power to reach its enemies and strike down its most determined adversary. In their rush to declare the capture of their cherished prize, the soldiers didn‚Äôt appear as conquerors but as a motley assembly of tribal marauders, gathering around the lifeless body of a fallen enemy. Their victory was not one of triumph but of desperation, of an army and a people lost in the fog of conquest clinging to the illusion of power. 

Although it remains uncertain, it appears that the photo was released without prior approval and before Israel could carefully curate the narrative of his martyrdom. Despite the power of the military censor and the tight control over information, Israel rushed to leak its success, barely realizing that those images would unravel the very narrative it had spent a year constructing around the Palestinian leader and shatter his portrayal as a cynical leader indifferent to the suffering of his people. The ‚Äúvictory image‚Äù instead exposed the fragility of the story Israel wished to tell, designed to render Palestinian leaders diabolical and project onto them the cowardice and corruption of their own ‚ÄúKing Bibi‚Äù and to sow divisions within Palestinian society. 



The military fatigues, the keffiyeh wrapped around his face, his defiant last stand ‚Äî all of this contained the essence of Sinwar‚Äôs final moment. Here was a leader who did not fall through precise intelligence or get caught in a dark tunnel surrounded by captives, as Israel would have us believe, but was slain in battle as his enemies, fearing their own deaths, fired tank shells at him from a distance rather than face him as he stood confronting their drones and machines.



Paradoxically, Israel‚Äôs image of victory was anything but victorious. Yes, they killed Yahya Sinwar, but in his death, they also exposed the cracks in their own power and the irrevocable loss of their once-charismatic militarism.

The contrast could not be more striking when we draw parallels between Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Israeli leaders fight for political survival, cloaking their ambitions in the language of an existential war, while Palestinian leaders fight tooth and nail, tethered to the soil beneath their feet, throwing sticks at drones. Israeli leaders weave rhetoric from a distance, while Palestinian leaders bleed on the frontlines. Israeli leaders send their sons to distant lands, safe across the ocean, while Palestinian leaders offer themselves and their families, finding no refuge but in the promise of resistance.

Their own newspapers describe Israeli leaders as ‚Äúpsychopathic,‚Äù manipulative, calculating, and indifferent even to the fate of Israeli captives. Meanwhile, Palestinian leaders have fought and died to free their prisoners. The contrast couldn‚Äôt be starker between a leadership driven by self-preservation and detached power and a leadership bound to the struggle for liberation, its sacrifices both personal and collective.

**The mythic power of force** 

Israel believes that assassinations hold the power to dismantle resistance ‚Äî that killing a leader might somehow end the struggle. Even though Sinwar was not assassinated as imagined, this myth remains anchored in the conviction that Arabs are little more than disorganized tribes poised to crumble with the death of their ‚Äúsheikh.‚Äù Israel‚Äôs belief in this racist and orientalist fantasy has cost it dearly, especially when it underestimated Hamas‚Äôs strength before October 7. That same mentality conflates revenge with victory, punishment with military success, and tactics with strategic change, a mentality that assumes only Israelis build institutions and possess the capacity for creative forms of organization. 

Israeli newscasters framed Sinwar‚Äôs death as a ‚Äúgame-changer,‚Äù revealing a mindset that underscores how deeply Israel misreads the intricate dynamics of a movement far more complex than it wishes to acknowledge.

Moreover, it hints at a deeper desire among many Israelis to signal to the right-wing forces driving the country toward perpetual war, with its increasingly complex multi-front entanglements, that the time has come for a political settlement. As Israeli protestors demanding a ceasefire and a prisoners‚Äô exchange suggested in their chants, ‚ÄúYou got your Sinwar, now bring our prisoners home from Gaza.‚Äù 

The killing of one man, after all, has done nothing to shift the tectonic plates of the war, and it hasn‚Äôt halted Israel‚Äôs deeper commitment to expansion and ethnic cleansing. The economic decline continues, and the fractures within Israeli society remain deep and unhealed. Israel‚Äôs underlying contradictions have not disappeared, but have been exposed even more starkly, leaving Israel in a bind from which no assassination can offer a way out. 

When Jared Kushner, that poster child of privilege, gleefully boasted on X that Nasrallah‚Äôs death was a monumental victory that promised to reverse the tide in the region, it offered a rare glimpse into Israel‚Äôs precarious and manufactured sense of confidence. His triumphalism betrayed a deep anxiety that has long shadowed Israeli politics, and one could almost hear the echo of a nation desperate to close the existential rupture created on October 7. But the gaping wound from that day is far deeper than any single assassination could ever mend.

In this Israel has displayed a remarkable inability to learn from history, placing a near-mythic faith in the power of force and failing to understand that history has shifted beneath its feet. Perhaps in an earlier time, under specific conditions, an assassination might have delivered the victory Israel so desperately craved, but today the calculus has changed. The old tools of covert operations, targeted killings, or even large-scale punishment campaigns no longer achieve the kind of conclusive results they once promised. 

Firstly, the battlefield is no longer confined to physical terrain but has expanded into the realm of perception, where Israel‚Äôs actions expose its desperation rather than its dominance. Secondly, Palestinians and Arabs have formed social, ideological, and political organizations that outlive their leaders. While emotional attachments to specific leaders exist, the impact of a single assassination remains at best tactical. The Palestinians and Arabs have grown accustomed to the loss of their leaders, and through their protracted duel with Israel, have adjusted accordingly.

This is the case with Yahya Sinwar, whose death may have offered Israel a fleeting sense of gleeful revenge. Israel‚Äôs momentary indulgence in its grim rituals of celebration, as a nation that appears to find solace in the spectacle of death, found an occasion to rally around the myth of invincibility. But despite the fervor with which Sinwar‚Äôs death was framed, it was far from the transformative ‚Äúgame changer‚Äù Israel wished to project.

**The child and the imagination**

The life of Yahya al-Sinwar mirrors the life of the Palestinian resistance itself. Born in the Khan Younis refugee camp, where existence begins in the narrowest of alleyways, he grew up in a world where children play ‚ÄúArabs and Army‚Äù ‚Äî a variation of hide-and-seek that mimics the brutal reality they are destined to live. In this game, children rehearse the roles they would soon know too well: soldiers shouting and shooting, Arabs fleeing and throwing stones.

In those tight corridors, beneath the unblinking sky and the ever-present threat of the machines of death that hover above, life reveals itself not as a distant dream, but as a battlefield. Here, innocence is quickly eroded, and the struggle for survival becomes the only language left to speak. In these streets and alleyways, resistance is born and takes shape not as a choice but as a necessity etched into the lives of those for whom defiance is the only path to dignity.

Sinwar grew up as Palestinians have always grown up, constantly imagining a different world where dignity and freedom are more than distant dreams.

Sinwar grew up as Palestinians have always grown up, constantly imagining a different world where dignity and freedom are more than distant dreams. To live under occupation is to live with the ever-present question, ‚ÄúWhat is to be done?‚Äù It haunts every step, a question asked not in abstract terms, but in the daily struggle against a reality that denies one‚Äôs very existence. There is very little time to intellectualize or theorize, and perhaps even less time to disentangle the web of relations that produces the refugee camp. For Sinwar, like so many others, this question is a guiding force, a call to action that resonated in the narrow streets of Khan Younis and beyond, shaping his life as it has shaped the lives of countless Palestinians ‚Äî demanding not just survival, but the creation of a new world out of the ruins of the old.

As Palestinians grow up, some find themselves accommodating to a world that has persistently rejected them, worn down by the relentless power of Israel‚Äôs incarceration machine or its ability to kill. The weight of this machinery looms large, a force that not only imprisons bodies but stifles dreams. For some, the fear of disappearing behind bars becomes too heavy to bear, and they retreat into survival, compromising with a system that seems inescapable. 

Disillusionment deepens as comrades, once bound by a shared oath and common secrets, betray the cause, choosing personal safety over collective struggle. In this fractured reality, the pull of resistance still endures, but for those who have seen betrayal and defeat up close, it is often accompanied by the bitter knowledge of what has been lost along the way. When they raise the question of what is to be done, they retreat behind closed doors or curse those who take the initiative.

Sinwar was not one of those who surrendered to fear or disappointment. He continued to play ‚ÄúArabs and Army‚Äù his entire life, though the stakes were no longer child‚Äôs play. For him, the game transformed into a lifelong struggle, where the roles became real and the battlefield extended beyond the narrow alleyways of Khan Younis. The soldiers were no longer imagined, the stones no longer symbolic. He excelled at those games, exposing the soldiers for their dishonor, cowardice, and inability to fight when the machines were not there to protect them against Palestinian fire when their army collapsed like a house of cards on October 7. 

Sinwar exposed the truth about Israel‚Äôs post-heroic army that only survives from a distance, shielded by armor and dependent on the excessive use of firepower. The myth of bravery and direct engagement has long been abandoned, replaced by a military that shies away from close confrontation, preferring to strike from the safety of drones, artillery, and airstrikes. In Sinwar‚Äôs last stand, this fear was laid bare‚Äîa military unwilling to face its enemy eye to eye, relying instead on distant destruction, where the risk of true combat is minimized.

Israel chose to shell a wounded fighter who had already lost his weapon, not out of necessity, but out of the pleasure of killing and the fear of facing death themselves. Rather than capture him ‚Äî an act that could have yielded not only valuable intelligence but also the powerful image of a leader taken alive ‚Äî Israel opted to kill the one man who could be pressured for information on its captives. In doing so, Israel sacrificed a potential strategic victory for immediate destruction, exposing the cowardice of its military machine.

This choice was no anomaly; it reflects Israel‚Äôs broader approach to the conflict ‚Äî destruction over strategy, or rather, destruction and massacres as a strategy. Its method is rooted in fear and the unwillingness to confront Palestinian resistance, and where the battlefield cannot be won by force alone.

The only courage Israel shows today is the courage to wield its American-manufactured machines.

Yet the impact of Yahya Sinwar was not due to any singular power he possessed. His success lay in something far greater ‚Äî a disciplined, highly organized, and competent resistance movement that had been meticulously built and sustained, even during his long years behind bars. This is why his story is not just one of personal defiance but of a collective strength that was able to bring Palestine back to the center and unsettle the empire and its managers. He reminded Israelis that Palestinians will neither yield nor submit, and that surrender is not in their vocabulary.

In response, Israel chose the path of genocide, and it did so willingly, deliberately, and in cowardice. It laid bare its childish fantasy of nation-building through destruction, of erasing a people and their history to secure its own fragile existence. In choosing extermination over reconciliation, Israel has exposed its moral and political bankruptcy, the hollowness of its narrative, and the unending resistance that will continue to rise from the rubble.

Sinwar opened the deepest void in Israel‚Äôs self-understanding, fully aware that doing so would cost him his life. The little boy from Khan Younis, who once played ‚ÄúArabs and Army‚Äù in the cramped alleyways of the refugee camp, became the man who compelled Israel to confront its own fears and unravel its illusions haunted still by the question of its existence, and leading itself towards death by its own sword. 

**And even if Israel annihilates every last Palestinian, the world will know the truth ‚Äî it was not the Israelis who won, but their machines.**

Please delete if not allowed. I'd like to ask how to respond to people who justify Israeli war crimes with the argument that it's impossible for civilians not to die in those numbers in an urban environment, and/or that there's past evidence of Hamas forcing civilians to stay, and/or that Hamas hides or stores weapons under civilian infrastructure. 

My usual response is that there is no evidence of this provided for every single bombing. I also point out that the types of weapons used almost guarantee more destruction and civilian casualties. 

Is there something else that can be said?  I noticed even in the International Court's charges they had to focus on the blocking of aid, because in a war situation, it's hard to prove intent to kill more civilians. "

1g809vz,Historical films depicting resistance against colonialism,2024-10-20 14:43:28,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1g809vz/historical_films_depicting_resistance_against/,"I recently watched two older movies: the ""Battle of Algiers"" as well as ""The Lion of the Desert"". They depict the struggle against two colonial powers - France and Italy - and the brutal tactics used by these powers to try to retain their control as well as the actions of the resistance. I would encourage everyone to watch these and read the history of colonialism in these countries as well as what led to their ultimate freedom. What is happening in Palestine today is the same thing, except 70 years later. 

Algeria and Libya were not alone in experiencing this - just they happened to have two movies dedicated to their struggle. War criminals like Rodolfo Graziani never faced justice even though he was responsible for hundreds of thousands placed in concentration camps and murdered in Libya and Ethiopia (the Nazis actually visited concentration camps in Libya to learn how to run them). He ultimately died of old age after serving in the Italian civilian government after WW2. 100000 Italians honored him by attending his funeral. A monument was built at his burial place in 2012.

I only mention all of this to remind people that colonialism and racism and seeing non-europeans as subhuman is not new and still exists as shown by the treatment of the Palestinians today. The children of the people that committed these atrocities as recently as the 1950s and 1960s are the ones in power today and it is normal that many still hold onto the same underlying racist beliefs and support the genocide of the Palestinian people by a European power.  These events I talked about occurred abroad, but for those in the US - hospitals had a white section and a colored section well into the 1960s and we still have people living today that experienced segregation. The only solution is for the oppressed people of the world to stand together against injustice, and to not forget that unless you stand for others who are suffering you may be next."

I know Israel proper is not some post racial utopia, and that de facto and de jure apartheid exists there, but the voice of so called ""Arab Israelis"" has been conspicuously absent from the conversation around this conflict. I guess I just want to know what daily life is like for you. I imagine Palestinian citizens of Israel might be scared to voice their opinion on this issue, since providing ""material support for terrorism"" is grounds for deportation to Gaza or the West Bank.

But do you notice or face discrimination in your daily life? To what extent do you interact with Jewish Israelis? Do you see yourself as Palestinian, Israeli, or both? What connection do you feel to those living in the occupied territories, and how do you feel about the resistance, armed and unarmed? Generally speaking, how ""welcome"" do you feel in Israel these days?

I'm a British woman who has lived in the US for almost twenty years. I currently live in a neighborhood which is very pro Israel. Quite a lot of Jewish people in the area and a lot of Israeli flags on display. 
I have always been a Palestinian supporter and I have spent the last year with my blood boiling. I am often talking about and posting about Palestine. I actually just lost a friend due to my open support of Palestine. This I can handle, however, my teenage son has been trying to stick up for Palestine in front of his pro Israeli friends (some of whom are Jewish). He's been laughed at and ridiculed for being ""pro Palestinian"" by these friends. He doesn't fully understand but I think he's heard enough from me to get the gist of who the bad guys in this story are. He does also has an old friend (not in our current neighborhood) who is Palestinian. 
I don't know what to do. How do I help him? I don't want him to be ostracized but also don't want him to kowtow to them. His friends think they know it all and have even said they want to come debate me on the issue!!

I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about what's happening in Palestine. It feels like Israel‚Äôs long-term plan might be to either completely wipe out the Palestinian population or reduce it to such a small number that they hardly matter anymore. After that, it seems like Israel would take over the remaining Palestinian land as part of their own.

What's really worrying is how the world seems to have gotten used to seeing Palestinians suffer. It‚Äôs like the violence, mass killings, and destruction have become so common that people, governments, and the media don‚Äôt react as strongly anymore. The Palestinian genocide seems to be unfolding in slow motion, and it‚Äôs terrifying to think that the global community might just be accepting it.

Most of the time, we see weak responses from international leaders, and no real push for a solution. So, I‚Äôm left wondering: is this what the future looks like? Are we watching the slow disappearance of an entire people, and is the world just okay with the ongoing Palestinian genocide?

I‚Äôd love to hear what others think. Do you believe Israel has a long-term plan to eliminate or greatly reduce the Palestinian population? And if so, why do you think the world is becoming so numb to it? What can be done to stop this?

Looking forward to your opinions!"

I need to vent about it and any guidance you have is appreciated. I wear this necklace that had the Palestinian flag on one side and the keffiyeh pattern on the other. I thought it would be fine to wear since its just cultural symbols and doesnt directly say any political statement but someone wrote in our guest survey about how them and their jewish family ""doesnt feel safe with an employee wearing a ""free palestine"" necklace so close to the anniversary of october 7th"". I saw this comment on my own, and I havent been talked to about it yet but i worry that they wont let me wear it anymore and that makes me extremely upset. I know for a fact that if i was wearing an Israeli flag they wouldnt ask me not to. Im extremely offended by the prospect that the Palestinian flag and a cultural scarf is somehow ""unsafe"" on their own. Im preparing to have to defend myself and my right to wear it. 

Edit because i wanted to add: i work for a company that prides itself on its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and has a sign on the door that says ""hate has no home here"". That feels a little relevant to me. 

Edit again with another noteworthy add: since wearing the necklace Ive gotten many, several positive comments about it from customers directly telling me in the moment.  This would be the first negative one. So hopefully that works in my favor. "

For those who do not know, the Balfour Declaration is a public statement issued by the British government during World War I to declare its support for the establishment of a ‚Äúnational home for the Jewish people‚Äù in Palestine, which was an Ottoman territory with a Jewish minority (about 3-5% of the total population). It was a letter dated November 2, 1917, from the British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Lord Lionel de Rothschild, a prominent figure in the British Jewish community, for transmission to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. The text of the declaration was published in the press on November 9, 1917.¬†[read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration)

[Balford Declaration](https://preview.redd.it/qk84zhiwxlvd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d56e83d4fcda30dcf37725b36866b1bbf71105df)

  
So I decided to simulate the historical event and try to correct it by building a platform that allows any user to impersonate Arthur Belford and create his version of the declaration and I put a list of countries that support the establishment of the Zionist entity so that he can choose a part of their lands to present to the Jews since these countries support the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãestablishing a state called Israel.

**What's TNH1917 About?**

The idea at first was just to create a form that would allow anyone to create their own Belford declaration, then the idea was expanded to include 6 more sections.:

1. **The Poll:**¬†Step into the shoes of Arthur Balfour and create your own ""declaration."" Choose a country from a list of nations that support the right to a homeland for Israel and decide on aspects like allocated area and policies regarding the indigenous population. Your personalized declaration can then be printed or sent to the embassy of the chosen country.
2. **Events:**¬†This section provides a timeline of events before and after October 7th, aiming to present a comprehensive view of the circumstances leading up to recent developments.
3. **Numbers:**¬†A compilation of data comparing losses, support, and other statistics related to both parties since the latest escalation. (We're actively seeking reliable sources to ensure accuracy.)
4. **Humans:**¬†A memorial page honoring victims, including profiles of those who have lost their lives, been injured, or displaced. (Contributions with verified information are welcome.)
5. **Fallacies & Facts (F&F):**¬†Addressing common misconceptions and propaganda by presenting clear facts alongside prevalent myths, with plans to include detailed references.
6. **Decentralized United Nations (DUN):**¬†An ambitious initiative to gather signatures for a global petition advocating for an updated international system. The goal is to promote a fairer global governance model that reflects today's realities, including a review of veto powers.
7. **Discussion Platform:**¬†A forum dedicated to open and respectful dialogue about all aspects of the platform and related topics, especially considering the censorship some face on mainstream social media platforms.

The name¬†**TNH1917**¬†reflects the term ""National Home"" from the Balfour Declaration and the year it was issued.

The project is open source and I have no personal intentions behind it. I would like to hear your opinion regarding the idea and the way to market it and whether it will succeed or just a failed attempt. Up until now, I do not have experience in marketing these projects. In addition, I ask everyone to contribute whatever information they have regarding the issue, especially the data and numbers aspect, in the forum dedicated to that.

Like many other victims of the Israeli air strikes they lie buried under the rubble - this time in Gaza City, in the north.

A teenage boy was pulled from the first floor of a collapsed building. As his feet and legs emerged it looked as if he might be alive.

But then the whole body was lifted free, and flopped lifelessly in the arms of the rescuers.

They leaned across and passed the boy through a window below, and into the waiting arms of another group of men.

In the narrow streets men dug with their hands. But there were no sounds coming from the rubble now. Whoever lay there was beyond help.

Ramez Abu Nasr was digging for hours. His mother, father and brothers were entombed by the falling masonry.

Ramez managed to save his youngest brother. The boy told him that he had heard his parents nearby, reciting the Shehada, the Muslim prayer of faith.

Soon after they were silent.

‚ÄúI took out my younger brother at the last moment. I don‚Äôt know how we can go back to our home... without my mother, or father, or brothers,‚Äù says Ramez.

The family fled here from Jabalia when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) began their renewed offensive against Hamas in the north twelve days ago.

The IDF issued an evacuation order affecting an estimated 400,000 people in the northern Gaza Strip, telling them to move to the south.

But many thousands stayed behind, exhausted by constant displacement, fearful of heading to a place where they had no access to supplies."

1g5g28d,How Settler Violence Against Palestinians Serves Israel's Interests,2024-10-17 01:57:18,155,https://archive.is/gipCC,"##Attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank have surged since Oct. 7, 2023. 

The heads of the Israeli military‚Äôs Central Command and security service made recently worried statements about the surge in violence perpetrated by Jewish settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank.

But there‚Äôs something misleading about these statements. They portray the settlers who commit violence as if they‚Äôre operating outside the norms of Israeli occupation, as if the official actions of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) itself are not violent and soldiers are not involved. This framing allows the IDF, the sovereign power in the West Bank, to evade responsibility for the attacks. 

Since the 2000s, [two armies](https://archive.is/7RYGi) within the IDF have gradually formed; alongside the official army, a policing force has emerged in the Israeli-controlled West Bank. This comprises an infantry brigade permanently stationed in the region, units of the border police, and settler militias armed and trained by the IDF for ostensibly self-defense. Unlike the official army, this policing army is informally controlled by a matrix rather than a hierarchical structure, characterized by a network of informal agencies, the most important of which are the settlers‚Äô communities and their politically powerful leadership.

While the official task of this policing army is to protect both Palestinian and Jewish communities, its [unofficial task](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13530194.2021.1972795) is to promote the quiet annexation of parts of the West Bank and prevent territorial contiguity of the Palestinian Authority. To this end, the policing army needs settler violence to carry out what official Israel cannot.

[Settler violence is a form of government policy, aided and abetted by official state authorities with their active participation](https://www.btselem.org/settler_violence). This is why such violence is systematically tolerated. Between 2005 and 2023, only 3 percent of investigations launched into ideologically motivated offenses by Israelis against Palestinians led to convictions. In 2022, when Israel was led by a center-right government, the monthly average of settler attacks on Palestinians stood at about 71. That figure surged to [about 110](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-201-west-bank) after the start of the war in Gaza last year.

We should distinguish between two forms of settler violence:

* **Functional violence** is the type that serves the state‚Äôs goals‚Äîincluding violence instrumental to land grabs‚Äîand is therefore tolerated. 
* **Dysfunctional violence** is extremely aggressive and escalates to a degree that threatens the security order in the West Bank, which official Israel seeks to preserve, and significantly harms the country‚Äôs international legitimacy.

Dysfunctional violence includes organized and lethal attacks by settlers on Palestinian communities, such as the [recent one in the town of Jit](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/world/middleeast/israel-settlers-attack-jit-west-bank.html). Dozens of settlers, some masked, set fire to buildings and cars and hurled rocks and firebombs. This kind of attack does not serve Israel‚Äôs concrete goal. Similar examples include settlers‚Äô attacks against the IDF. It is this dysfunctional violence that Israeli officials condemn.

In contrast, functional violence is tolerated. Since the beginning of the war, some [19 isolated Palestinian communities and single-farm families, comprising about 1,100 residents, were forcibly displaced.](https://www.btselem.org/settler_violence/20231019_forcible_transfer_of_isolated_communities_and_families_in_area_c_under_the_cover_of_gaza_fighting) In all cases, the families left following violence committed by settlers or threats thereof, in some instances accompanied by soldiers. When the displaced communities demanded to return to their lands under IDF protection, the military prevented their return and even explicitly declared that it had no intention of assisting them. One community, [the village of Khirbet Zanuta](https://archive.is/OLRVP), secured a court decision and been allowed to return. But in the meantime, settlers destroyed most of the homes there, the military has not permitted the residents to rebuild and has even pressured them to leave the village."

*May otherwise be known as: Explosive robots, explosive-laden robots, bomb-laden robots, empty military vehicles loaded with explosives being triggered remotely, remote explosive robots*    
     
""The Israeli army used these robots for the first time in Gaza in May 2024 during its second incursion into Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. Today, in its declared plan to depopulate northern Gaza, the Israeli army is using 3 methods: 
1. Relentless and indiscriminate aerial bombardment
2. Planting explosives in homes and blowing them up 
3. Using booby-trapped robots
    
**Israel's use of booby-trapped robots is prohibited under international law, as they are considered indiscriminate weapons that cannot be directed or limited to military targets.** Due to their nature, they directly hit civilians, or hit military targets, civilians or civilian property indiscriminately. As such, they are illegal weapons under international law, and using them in residential areas is a crime against humanity in and of itself.""

Conceived by retired Major-General Giora Eiland, the plan aimed to empty the area of the approximately 300,000 Palestinians who had refused to flee and had remained in their homes in the north, so Israel could take full control of the area and make it part of a buffer zone.""

The West Bank increasingly resembles Gaza.",2024-10-14 02:30:52,112,https://archive.is/Fc0t9,"Late in the morning of Wednesday, September 25, Amani Amur, 82, died in her home in the village of Anza. While the men were taking part in the funeral procession, the women gathered in the dead woman's home, as is the custom. 

Just then, an Israel Defense Forces special-ops unit invaded the village. Not an everyday occurrence in this relatively peaceful village. The troops passed by the house of mourning and continued on their way to the home of Mohammed Brahami, who was wanted by the Israeli authorities.

According to witnesses, there was no special resistance during the arrest, other than stones being thrown at the force.

At approximately 5 P.M., shooting suddenly began, aimed at the house of mourning where the women were gathered. Individual shots, one after the other, not in a burst, were fired at the house. This went on for about five or six minutes, with some pauses. No one in the house had the slightest idea as to what prompted the soldiers to open fire, but the casualties mounted fast. 

The first was the grieving daughter-in-law, Zohur, who was hit by two rounds, in the chest and the stomach. Immediately afterward, Halima Amur, a 73-year-old relative, took a bullet to her face. Then the dead woman's 15-year-old granddaughter, Noor Abdel Hafez, was struck in the jaw and left hand; and finally, Sidra Abu Haniyeh, a girl of 9, was shot in the head. 

A field researcher who investigated the incident  reached the conclusion that the soldiers had aimed at the house of mourning and fired round after round at it for no apparent reason.

------

A week later, October 3, around 10 P.M. in the Tul Karm refugee camp. Along with the nearby Nur Shams camp, Tul Karm has been a major target of IDF offensive activity in recent months. Devastation is rampant there, with roads ripped up, infrastructure wrecked, homes in ruins. Some places in the camp look like they've been transplanted from the killing fields of Gaza. This past week, too, on the night between Sunday and Monday, six bulldozers and 20 jeeps entered to continue the army's mission of destruction.

The Al-Hiyat Caf√©, named for its proprietor, is situated in the Al-Hamam neighborhood in the heart of the Tul Karm camp. It is located on the ground floor of a three-story residential building, and has an apartment attached to it behind. At 10 P.M. last Thursday evening, the caf√© was abuzz with young people. 

Suddenly, in the sky above the caf√©, the sound of drones could be heard ‚Äì par for the course here. But an instant later the skies thundered and three huge explosions ripped through the camp, sending a cloud of dust skyward. Three missiles had been fired at the caf√© from an Israel Air Force fighter plane. Just a quarter of an hour from the central Israeli city of Netanya, the air force is bombing densely crowded population centers almost indiscriminately.

In the apartment attached to the caf√© an entire family was wiped out. There is no way to know who was still awake when the missiles landed on them or who was killed in their sleep. But they are all dead: the mother, Sajaa Harwish, 28; the father, Mohammed Abu Zahra, 31; and their two small children, 8-year-old Sham and 5-year-old Karam. A whole family, innocent of any wrongdoing, obliterated. All told, 18 people were killed in the caf√© and adjacent apartment. The target of the attack was Zahi Oufi, 39, the commander of Hamas in the Tul Karm camp.

The field researcher, says that in his view at least six of those killed were noncombatants.

-----

We wanted to cover these two grim events this week. Getting to Tul Karm camp was out of the question, after we learned that the army was still operating there. So we headed for the village of Anza. The soldiers at the checkpoint were behaving differently than usual, turning back all vehicles with yellow Israeli license plates. They said that Israelis were not allowed to enter Area A of the West Bank ‚Äì something I as a journalist have been doing for the past 35 years consecutively.

It's another worrisome sign of the dangerous Gaza-fication of the West Bank: a ban on proper journalistic coverage. Maybe we'll soon be able to travel in the West Bank, too, only with the permission of the IDF spokesman, to report on places and stories that only he allows, under his supervision and escorted by his soldiers, as has been the case in the Gaza Strip since 2006."

We can go around and around this circle.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have a right to self-defense, but you have to exercise this self-defense in a certain way,‚Äù said Judge Kai Ambos, a law professor at the University of G√∂ttingen in Germany, who serves on a special tribunal at The Hague that prosecutes war crimes committed in Kosovo during the 1990s. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not limitless.‚Äù

Interpretation would have to be settled by a court or the United Nations Security Council. But it is rare for courts or the Security Council to address these types of questions.

##What does international law say?

[Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/en/content/purposes-and-principles-un-chapter-i-un-charter#:~:text=Article%202%20(4)%20of%20the,political%20independence%20of%20other%20States.) ‚Äúprohibits the threat or use of force and calls on all members to respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of other states.‚Äù But [Article 51 of the charter](https://legal.un.org/repertory/art51.shtml) also makes clear that member states have a right to defend themselves from armed attacks.

There are more complications. Lebanon is a sovereign state, but Israel says it is fighting against Hezbollah, which is both a militant group and an influential player in Lebanon‚Äôs government. (Israel and the United States consider it a terrorist organization.)

Some experts say the invasion is legal because Lebanon allows Hezbollah to use its territory to strike Israel.

##Humanitarian legal protections

Separate from questions about the legality of Israel‚Äôs invasion, every country has a legal obligation to safeguard civilians during warfare.

Even if Hezbollah places military targets in civilian buildings, for example, experts say Israel must consider the safety of the noncombatants inside when it conducts airstrikes. (International law does not distinguish between ground invasions and airstrikes ‚Äî the measure is ‚Äúuse of force,‚Äù according to Oona A. Hathaway, a professor of international law at Yale University.)

[The United Nations says](https://unscol.unmissions.org/full-transcript-un-secretary-generals-press-encounter-situation-middle-east) more than 1,500 people have been killed in Lebanon by the Israeli military in the past two weeks, including hundreds of deaths in a single day in September, during [one of the most intense air raids in recent warfare.](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-strikes-deaths.html?smid=url-share)

‚ÄúWhile it is difficult to make definitive legal assessments of individual attacks from far away,‚Äù said Janina Dill, the co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict, in an email, ‚Äúthe use of heavy explosives in densely populated areas of Lebanon and attacks against residential buildings where Hezbollah militants are suspected to hide, which have caused hundreds of casualties, many of them women and children civilians, raise very serious concerns about compliance with these rules.‚Äù

Nearly one million people have been forced to flee their homes in Lebanon, a humanitarian crisis that many fear will soon rival the one in Gaza.

Humanitarian laws of war, including the Geneva Conventions, require military forces to give civilians ample warning to flee before attacking. Israel has issued evacuation alerts for large sections of south Lebanon, though, in some cases, it has given people as little as two hours to leave their homes before striking.

Israel is also required to consider whether displaced people can be relocated safely. For example, the United Nations says more than 250,000 people have fled from Lebanon to Syria, which is still ravaged from a civil war that began in 2011.

The US and allies are still fully supporting this genocide while parroting falsehoods, and allowing Israel to escalate and expand the carnage. Rulings from the highest court in the world have not stopped it.            
      
[A year ago Palestinian trade unions made an urgent call on workers everywhere to end all complicity and stop arming Israel.](https://www.workersinpalestine.org/the-calls-languages/english) It is evident that not enough has been done here, and that it must be the priority.    
      
Israel cannot perpetrate this destruction and slaughter without the weapons and military aid it imports from other countries. The focus now can only be on pushing to ban arms sales to Israel, but more immediately‚Äî turning all efforts towards **preventing weapons exports to Israel**‚Äì This is something the people can directly impact. Workers of the world need to be galvanised, the power to significantly slow down if not halt this genocide is in trade union solidarity and actions with this as a focus.     
    
Israel imports the majority of its armaments. This means that the international working class can act to cripple its military. Workers in a position to stop guns, bombs, rockets, military vehicles and all other supplies going to the IDF must do so. A coalition of Palestinian unions had already made an urgent call (a year ago) for unions in all relevant industries around the world to refuse to build or transport weapons destined for Israel. This applies to other supplies necessary for this massacre to continue, like oil and other fuels.     
     
**The original statement from the coalition of Palestinian unions called on trade unions & workers in relevant industries to:**      
1. Refuse to build weapons destined for Israel
2. Refuse to transport weapons to Israel
3. Pass motions in their trade union to this effect
4. Take action against complicit companies involved in implementing Israel‚Äôs brutal and illegal siege, especially if they have contracts with your institution
5. Pressure governments to stop all military trade with Israel, and in the case of the US, funding to it

##[PDF link](https://nwtrcc.org/PDFs/w4.pdf)


##‚ÄúNo taxation without representation!‚Äù


Your money is being used to fund bombs being dropped on the other side of the world, billions of dollars at a time.


In about 10 minutes, you can stop funding war (and get a little extra every paycheck!)


##üéµ**It‚Äôs easy as 1-2-3!**
1. Calculate your federal income tax for the whole year (don‚Äôt panic, its going to a big number‚Äì remember this is out of your annual income)
2. Add the standard deduction (in 2024: $14,600 for single filers, $29,200 for joint filers and $21,900 for heads of household)
3. Put this total in Form W4 line 4b ‚ÄúDeductions‚Äù


###You should note:


- You can update your tax information at any time. Most employers have this setup electronically. It takes a few minutes and usually takes a couple paychecks to become effective. 
- This method increases your W4 deductions so that you don‚Äôt pay federal income tax. **Deductions do not need _any_ evidence or explanation.**
- If you are not a W2 employee, there are similar methods of resistance for 1099 or self-employed income. 


###**IMPORTANT:**
**Most people resist war taxes, but still file their taxes. This is because there are severe penalties for failing to file. The legal risks of not paying are much smaller. This guide is not financial advice and I am not a lawyer, accountant, or financial advisor. Please read about legal risks and make your own informed decision on how to resist.**

Among Israelis, there is a common myth that the name ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù was introduced by Roman Emperor Hadrian, who renamed the province of Judea to ‚ÄúPalestina‚Äù (Latin: Syria Palaestina) in order to weaken the Jewish connection to the land.

Thus, according to the myth, the first kingdom on this land was the Jewish kingdom, with all the consequences that follow.

This is absolutely true. Half true, to be precise. This event did take place, but the name ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù was used much earlier. Let‚Äôs take a look.

In fact, the name ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù originates from the Greek word ‚ÄúŒ†Œ±ŒªŒ±ŒπœÉœÑŒØŒΩŒ∑‚Äù (Palaist√≠nƒì), which in turn comes from ‚ÄúPhilistia‚Äù ‚Äî the Latin variant of the name of the Philistines, an ancient people who lived on the coast of this region around the 13th‚Äì11th centuries BCE.

The origin of the name and its connection to the Philistines is widely recognized in historical scholarship and confirmed by various sources from antiquity as well as later archaeological and textual evidence.

The earliest use of the term ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù in the form ‚ÄúŒ†Œ±ŒªŒ±ŒπœÉœÑŒØŒΩŒ∑‚Äù is found in Greek historians. For example, Herodotus in his book *Histories* (5th century BCE) used the term ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù to describe the territory on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean, including lands inhabited by both the Philistines and other peoples.

The state of the Philistines was not a unified centralized state but rather a confederation of city-states located on the southwest coast of Canaan (modern-day Israel and the Gaza Strip). Their main cities were located along the Mediterranean coastal plain and formed the so-called ‚ÄúPentapolis‚Äù ‚Äî a union of five major Philistine city-states.

These cities are:

1. **Ashdod** ‚Äì one of the key Philistine cities, located on the coast in the central part of modern-day Israel‚Äôs coastal plain, near the modern city of Ashdod. It was an important trading and seaport, and one of the largest cities.

2. **Ashkelon** ‚Äì a major coastal city south of Ashdod, also located on the Mediterranean coast at the site of modern-day Ashkelon. It was a strategic point for the Philistines and served as a trading port.

3. **Gaza** ‚Äì the southernmost and possibly the most important city of the Philistines, located in what is now the Gaza Strip. Gaza was a vital trading city, situated at the crossroads of trade routes leading from Egypt to the Levant.

4. **Ekron** ‚Äì located inland, northeast of Ashdod, near modern-day Kiryat Ekron. Ekron was a center of agriculture and likely known for olive oil production, a key source of wealth for the Philistines.

5. **Gath** ‚Äì one of the largest Philistine cities, located further inland in southern Israel. Gath is associated with the legendary Philistine warrior Goliath. The city was located near modern-day Tel Zafit.

And finally, a little bit of Torah for dessert, because, well, who will be convinced by Herodotus?

*Genesis* (Bereshit) 21:31-32:

‚ÄúAnd they made a covenant at Be‚Äôer Sheva, and Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines.‚Äù

Hebrew:

Its clear that Israel's leadership are opposed to the formation of any Palestinian state, for all its flaws even the two-state solution is seen as a threat to Israel and thus the continuation of the west bank settlements exist to prevent it from ever happening. 

I dont know what will be the result of the ICJ recognizing the west bank settlements being illegal under international law, since thats been the stance of the global community for decades since the occupation started but that havent stopped the building of any settlements, so I dont know if it will be the first nail in Israel's coffin or not.

After much deliberation, planning, and orchestration, I have decided to organize another large scale art project for Palestine during this year‚Äôs BLINK 2024 festival in Cincinnati.Blink is the largest arts, music, and lights biennial festival in the United States, and twice I have applied to be an official artist during BLINK, and twice, I have been denied. The first time was in 2022, and we decided to organize a GoFundMe to light up the ‚ÄúWelcome to Jaffa‚Äù mural in Cincinnati, to much success and media coverage.[https://www.cincinnatimagazine.com/article/a-journey-of-discovery-bears-fruit-for-artist-jason-al-ghussein/](https://www.cincinnatimagazine.com/article/a-journey-of-discovery-bears-fruit-for-artist-jason-al-ghussein/)

[https://www.citybeat.com/arts/cincinnati-artist-creates-mural-in-over-the-rhine-to-pay-tribute-to-his-palestinian-heritage-13989429](https://www.citybeat.com/arts/cincinnati-artist-creates-mural-in-over-the-rhine-to-pay-tribute-to-his-palestinian-heritage-13989429)

This year has been a very difficult year for many of us. Many of us have lost friends or family in Palestine during this year of violence and destruction. As this year‚Äôs BLINK festival had been approaching, I had reached out to many various business and property owners throughout the City of Cincinnati asking if I could have permission to paint a new mural, dedicated to the Children of Gaza and Palestine. Many had said no. Some never bothered to respond to my emails. Other‚Äôs had already promised their wall surfaces to many of the other artists who are officially a part of the BLINK festival.

I had been feeling quite depressed and defeated, trying my best to secure a surface that had prominent visibility in the city, to no avail. I was sitting in a cafe, with a tight deadline approaching, ready to give up. It was at that moment I received a text message from my friend Josh Paul, with my cousin Jamal and Tarek Habash, who have sacrificed a lot to advocate for Palestine, and I knew I just couldn‚Äôt give up that easily.

I had reached out to an organization called POAH (preservation of affordable housing) here in Cincinnati, and was finally met with some enthusiasm and support regarding my art, and my efforts to paint a mural dedicated to the children of Gaza. After some time of communication, VP of Operations, Evelyn Starks-Spicer (cc‚Äôd on this email) gave me the formal permission I needed to begin this project on October 2nd. Immediately, I sprung into action to secure my surface preparation crew to begin doing the concrete/mortar repair work needed to repair the wall and facilitate the painting of a new mural.¬†

I have everything I need in place regarding my team of creatives, technicians, and support labor. We are experts in the fields of large scale creative projects, and are more than capable of executing this project, and have already begun working in parallel. However, we will need support in the form of funding to be able to execute this project with the required equipment, supplies, and machinery, which is not cheap. 

In order to execute this project, we are looking to raise $55,000. This will be a 45 foot tall and 75 foot wide mural of a girl from Gaza who got dressed up for Eid despite the current onslaught of devastation violence. It is an image I immediately fell in love with, and I think it highlights the strength and resilience of the Palestinian people like no other.

My goal of this project is to continue to use my art to educate others about the history of Palestine and the humanity of the Palestinian people, and use the publicity these large projects garner to direct more financial support to organizations on the ground doing the much needed and invaluable work in Gaza.

I hope you will consider donating to this project, and help to promote and share this with anyone you know who may be interested in supporting an artistic endeavor of this nature.After the mural is painted, it will be illuminated at night with laser projectors and animation. We are planning on using some of Macklemore‚Äôs track ""Hind‚Äôs Hall‚Äù to animate to, among others. I would love for him to be made aware of this project, as well as Roger Waters.¬†I have developed an application called BLONK which holds all of the locations of all of the art exhibitions throughout the city of Cincinnati during this year‚Äôs BLINK event. There will be an anticipated 2 Million people in attendance. And we will be including a donate button to PCRF within the application.¬†[https://blonkcincinnati.com/](https://blonkcincinnati.com/)

I am trying my best to use art as a medium to educate others and humanize the Palestinian people to western audiences. I hope that you will support me in that effort. A donation, no matter how large or small is deeply appreciated. The next best thing to do is share this GoFundMe page with anyone you know who may be interested in this effort.

Hospitals are overwhelmed, and a major ground invasion by Israel appears imminent. A country already mired in myriad crises is living through its worst nightmare. But its national military is remaining on the sidelines.

The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) face a unique, unenviable quandary: whether to participate in a war that engulfs their homeland. The LAF‚Äôs absence on the front line could be interpreted by some Lebanese citizens as dereliction of duty. Meanwhile, participation would mean backing Hezbollah in the war, which could threaten the LAF‚Äôs own relationship with its benefactors in the West.

Several sources, including Lebanese and Western military officials as well as local politicians and notables, told Foreign Policy that the LAF will likely stay out of the war as long as it can. The overarching sentiment seems to be that this isn‚Äôt a war that the LAF has the capabilities to win‚Äîor even to credibly participate in.

""[Palestinian liberation is disability justice.](https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2023/12/02/why-palestinian-liberation-is-disability-justice) This work is a small piece of that work, made possible by the ingenuity and dedication of Mirna El Helbawi and her Connecting Humanity team of less than 20 people, of three disabled Asian writers in the diaspora, by everyday people like you who have even $1 and a little bit of time to spare.¬†   
     
This disabled mutual aid work is a rebellious act against a hyper-capitalist, ableist world that insists we here in the west ignore our disabled kin in Palestine, Sudan, Congo, Lebanon, and beyond. For our disabled kin in Gaza and Jenin, we are refusing to let our disabled existence be used as cover for genocide and imperialism with every eSim we send and activate, with every cent donated.¬†    
     
Our hearts go out to everyone doing this work with us, to all those who are hurting for and grieving their family members experiencing ongoing genocides, and to every person using our eSims on the ground, surviving an ongoing genocide.""

Mentioned in the update is this blog post from January which is also an excellent read:
- [How Disabled Organizers Are Helping Palestinians in Gaza Stay Connected](https://organizingmythoughts.org/how-disabled-organizers-are-helping-palestinians-in-gaza-stay-connected)    
     
**Blog post excerpt:**         
‚ÄúWitnessing Palestinians refuse to leave each other behind ‚Äî the sick, the Disabled, the elders, the babies ‚Äî is the greatest love, the fiercest, most devoted act of Disability Justice. Witnessing Palestinians choose to move slower and more intentionally ‚Äî guiding wheelchair users under a never-ending rain of white phosphorus bombs, under the threat of inconceivable (but real) bombs with flying blades that explode your muscles into tiny pieces ‚Äî is nothing short of a miracle. It is a display of breathtaking interdependence‚Ä¶. The valiant Palestinians have shown us how to practice Disability Justice with no tools, left with nothing but your bones and heart and soul.‚Äù"

David Ben-Gurion (the first Israeli Prime Minister): Quoted by Nahum Goldmann in Le Paraddoxe Juif (The Jewish Paradox), pp121

Let us not ignore the truth among ourselves ‚Ä¶ politically we are the aggressors and they defend themselves‚Ä¶ The country is theirs, because they inhabit it, whereas we want to come here and settle down, and in their view we want to take away from them their country. ‚Ä¶ Behind the terrorism [by the Arabs] is a movement, which though primitive is not devoid of idealism and self sacrifice.‚Äù

The United States has supplied Israel with at least $17.9bn in military aid since its genocidal war on Gaza began on October 7 last year, according to a report for Brown University‚Äôs Costs of War project.

In addition, the U.S. has spent $4.86 billion on operations in the Middle East to support Israel and counter regional threats from Hezbollah and the Houthis.

The funding represents the largest amount of military assistance provided to Israel in a single year.

Excerpt from our article: In some cases, the answer is obvious. The U.S. may not currently see a war with Iran as desirable, but this is entirely secondary to its commitment to defend Israel no matter what. Even if Biden were not senile, the lack of political determination to stop Israel‚Äôs aggression would remain. As for the governments of Britain, Germany, France, Japan and other advanced ‚Äúdemocracies,‚Äù they are sycophants committed to upholding the U.S. world order even if it leads to the devastation of their own economies. They are not about to put up a fuss.  
  
But what about the forces opposing Israel, such as Iran? Or the millions who have demonstrated against the genocide in Gaza? Why haven‚Äôt they been able to stop the bloody spiral in West Asia? Here we must not only look at the balance of military force but also examine the political outlook of the various oppositions to Netanyahu. As we shall see, the real reason his government hasn‚Äôt been stopped is that its opponents lack a bold and coherent program to defeat Zionism and throw off imperialist domination of the region.

I'm a cognitive psychologist and have worked in a number of psychiatric wards;
i have seen several PTSD patients, many from the Iran-Iraq war, but my god i had never seen something like this one before.
i had never seen the look of absolute terror engraved on someone's face like this. This is beyond psychological trauma.

Does anyone know what happened to him after he was released? Is he still alive? Is he recieving care?

Her small steps stumble over the rubble, searching for meaning in the destruction.

You can read more about the history of US taxpayer money being sent to Israel here. This includes vast sums being sent following Hurricane Katrina - funds that should've been used to aid citizens following the natural disaster. Instead, that money was sent as economic aid for settlers occupying Gaza to rebuild settlements elsewhere.

I didn‚Äôt know and nobody told me and what  
could I do or say, anyway?

  
They said you shot the London Ambassador  
and when that wasn‚Äôt true  
they said so  
what

  
They said you shelled their northern villages  
and when U.N. forces reported that was not true  
because your side of the cease-fire was holding  
since more than a year before  
they said so  
what  
They said they wanted simply to carve  
a 25 mile buffer zone and then  
they ravaged your  
water supplies your electricity your  
hospitals your schools your highways and byways all  
the way north to Beirut because they said this  
was their quest for peace  
They blew up your homes and demolished the grocery  
stores and blocked the Red Cross and took away doctors  
to jail and they cluster-bombed girls and boys  
whose bodies  
swelled purple and black into twice the original size  
and tore the buttocks from a four month old baby  
and then  
they said this was brilliant  
military accomplishment and this was done  
they said in the name of self-defense they said  
that is the noblest concept  
of mankind isn‚Äôt that obvious?  
They said something about never again and then  
they made close to one million human beings homeless  
in less than three weeks and they killed or maimed  
40,000 of your men and your women and your children

  
But I didn‚Äôt know and nobody told me and what  
could I do or say, anyway?

  
They said they were victims. They said you were  
Arabs.  
They called¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†your apartments and gardens¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†guerrilla  
strongholds.  
They called¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†the screaming devastation  
that they created¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† the rubble.  
Then they told you to leave, didn‚Äôt they?

  
Didn‚Äôt you read the leaflets that they dropped  
from their hotshot fighter jets?  
They told you to go.  
One hundred and thirty-five thousand  
Palestinians in Beirut and why  
didn‚Äôt you take the hint?  
Go!  
There was the Mediterranean: You  
could walk into the water and stay  
there.  
What was the problem?

  
I didn‚Äôt know and nobody told me and what  
could I do or say, anyway?

  
Yes, I did know it was the money I earned as a poet that  
paid  
for the bombs and the planes and the tanks  
that they used to massacre your family

  
But I am not an evil person  
The people of my country aren't so bad

  
You can expect but so much  
from those of us who have to pay taxes and watch  
American¬†TV

  
You see my point;

  
I‚Äôm sorry.  
I really am sorry.

This poem was written in 1982 but could have been written today, yesterday, a year ago, or any day since 1948. The 7th of October is almost here, and the headlines and articles published by the Western mainstream this time will undoubtedly frame Israel as the victim and Palestinians and Lebanese as the aggressors, even more than usual. But this didn‚Äôt begin on October 7th, 2023. Since its establishment, Israel has consistently operated as an oppressive entity, with a long, blood-stained track record of violence and displacement tracing back to 1948. 

Armed resistance is a natural response to oppressive regimes throughout history, and groups like Hamas and Hezbollah are direct results of prolonged occupation and violence. Their rise isn‚Äôt born out of hatred or extremism for its own sake; it stems from years of displacement, military occupation, and a complete denial of basic human rights. Palestinian resistance is the inevitable outcome of a people left with no other avenue to assert their existence and dignity. Yet, Western media often erases this history, focusing instead on the symptoms of resistance while ignoring the root cause. 

Real peace will never come through temporary ceasefires or condemnation of resistance. It will only come by addressing the root causes - occupation, displacement, and apartheid - not by focusing solely on the reactions to those injustices. As long as those fundamental issues remain unresolved, the cycle of violence will continue, and this poem, written 40 years ago, will remain as relevant as it was in 1982, as relevant as it is today."

Here is mine: For Sydney, Australia

In my country our main organisers are too scared of backlash and overly compliant that they are unable to properly fight back against the narrative of lies told about my people.  
Many people are part of sectarian divides that stop them communicating and organising with other sects.  
Our chants are not that informative to the public.  
We have not increased our use of technology much, or even fixed bad speaker systems.  
We know our communications are compromised and that there are moles in the community.  
Most social media of the organisations is treated as information dissemination rather than a social place for people to discuss and refine new activist strategies or projects.  
The protests have become so normalised, they likely do not have the same impact anymore.  
We have done a great job at mobilising people, but not at actually getting them organised amongst themselves.

I think encouraging the community to actually organise amongst themselves in a decentralised way instead of relying on centralised leadership, would only give us more ideas to try and would help prevent us becoming stagnant. Many ideas for actions are useful in all countries with minor adjustments, same with lawsuits for companies still breaking international law, there are also many people working on similar projects (like BDS visualisers, data visualisation of israeli crimes over the years, knowledge graphs of related news, encrypted messaging systems, DIY police violence defence etc) that would save a lot of time if they had a way to work with each other instead of both doing the same thing.

It‚Äôs enraging that they consistently fail to present a balanced view, focusing only on one side. Where is the coverage of the thousands of Palestinians who have suffered due to the airstrikes, bombings, and blockades? How can they report on these events without acknowledging the humanitarian crisis that has devastated so many innocent lives?

Journalism is supposed to inform people with the truth, not manipulate public opinion by cherry-picking facts. The Times seems to ignore the disproportionate damage being done to Palestine, and it‚Äôs sickening to witness how they push this one-sided narrative. How can anyone trust their coverage when it‚Äôs so biased?

It‚Äôs time to stop pretending this is fair reporting. The Times needs to do better and hold themselves accountable to reflect the reality on the ground for both sides, not just Israel.

The definition of occupation under international law is, and I paraphrase, ‚Äúmaintaining effective control over another land or territory.‚Äú It should be concluded that, because of Israel‚Äôs blockade, it‚Äôs full unilateral control, over the land, the sea, and the airspace of the Gaza Strip, that Israel is still an occupying force of the Gaza Strip despite not bearing the traditional marker of occupation, which is to say a military presence inside the occupied territory."

1fve2mq,Eulogy for Aziz Salha,2024-10-03 18:06:13,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1fve2mq/eulogy_for_aziz_salha/,"Today, we reflect on the life of Aziz Salha, a man whose name became known to the world through a single moment of violence, but whose story reaches far beyond that event. To many, he was labeled a murderer, yet to those who knew him, Aziz was much more. He was a man shaped by a lifetime of struggle, resistance, and survival under the unyielding weight of occupation.

Born into a world where his people were denied their land, their rights, and their dignity, Aziz experienced the harsh realities of life under Israeli rule from a young age. His early years were marked by witnessing the daily injustices imposed on his people: families displaced, homes destroyed, loved ones injured or killed. For Aziz, these experiences weren‚Äôt just headlines or distant tragedies; they were woven into the fabric of his everyday life. He grew up in a community where the hope for peace faded, replaced by the cold reality of oppression that hardened around him.

In 2000, during the Ramallah lynching that would forever alter his life, Aziz acted not out of malice, but out of anger‚Äîan anger born from years of collective suffering. That day, he was not alone in his rage; it was shared by many Palestinians, a people pushed to the brink by an occupation that left them with little more than the impulse to resist. To understand Aziz is to understand the crushing weight of living under military rule, where checkpoints, curfews, and constant fear dictated every aspect of life.

Aziz was arrested after the lynching and sentenced to life in prison. But his time in captivity was not simply a punishment for his actions‚Äîit also revealed to him the brutal treatment of other Palestinians, many of whom were detained for far lesser offenses. In prison, he saw firsthand how the system targeted men and women alike‚Äîsome who had resisted, others who were simply at the wrong place at the wrong time. The cruelty was rampant: arbitrary beatings, psychological torment, and systemic humiliation were common. Aziz bore witness to countless innocent lives being crushed by a system built to dehumanize. What scarred him most was seeing others suffer the same fate simply because they were Palestinians living under occupation.

In 2011, Aziz was released as part of a prisoner exchange, returning to Gaza to live out his remaining years. While he never sought the limelight, perhaps he hoped for a quiet life, one where he could find some peace after years of turmoil. But his story was far from over.

In 2024, amidst another violent chapter of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Aziz was killed in an airstrike‚Äîone of many indiscriminate bombings that took the lives of so many in Gaza. He died alongside children, mothers, fathers, and countless innocents, all victims of a war that spares no one. Aziz‚Äôs death, like the deaths of countless others, was not just a personal loss for his family but a shared loss for a people who have endured decades of suffering.

Aziz Salha‚Äôs life was shaped by forces beyond his control‚Äîoccupation, violence, and resistance. But what truly determined his fate was the brutal reality of Israel‚Äôs apartheid regime, a state built on the subjugation and displacement of Palestinians. The Israeli government, through its relentless pursuit of land and power, has shown no regard for the humanity of the people it oppresses. From the systematic abuse in prisons to the indiscriminate bombings of civilians, Israel has committed itself to the erasure of Palestinian existence. Aziz was not merely a victim of violence; he was a victim of a state that uses military might to silence any voice that dares to demand freedom.

Today, we remember Aziz not just as an individual but as a symbol of defiance in the face of state-sponsored terror. His death, like the deaths of countless Palestinians, is a direct consequence of Israel's oppressive policies‚Äîpolicies that have disregarded international law and basic human rights for decades. Israel‚Äôs refusal to acknowledge the rights of the Palestinian people is a stain on the conscience of the world. Until it is held accountable, the cycle of violence and injustice will continue.

May we not only remember the lives lost but also challenge and condemn the state that continues to destroy them."

Currently everyone seems to think that only moral solution is to give Ukraine as much military aid as possible against Russia. Also same would probably happen with Taiwan if China start an incursion to Taiwan.

But in case of Palestine, even people who feel sympathy for Palestinians don't want to give them weapons or other military aid. They only want ceasefire and peace talks. Why is that the case?

Personally I can understand both points of view, but what I don't understand is the selectivity: if you think arming the one who is defending against the invader is the right choice, why that is not the case with Palestinians?"

Here‚Äôs what I have:


‚ÄúLet us not ignore the truth among ourselves ‚Ä¶ politically we are the aggressors and they defend themselves‚Ä¶ The country is theirs, because they inhabit it, whereas we want to come here and settle down, and in their view we want to take away from them their country. ‚Äú
- David Ben Gurion 1938

‚ÄúIf I were an Arab leader, I would never sign an agreement with Israel. It is normal; we have taken their country. ‚Ä¶ They see but one thing: we have come and we have stolen their country. Why would they accept that?‚Äù
- David Ben Gurion

‚ÄúWe have forgotten that we have not come to an empty land to inherit it, but we have come to conquer a country from people inhabiting it, that governs it by the virtue of its language and savage culture ..... Recently there has been appearing in our newspapers the clarification about ""the mutual misunderstanding"" between us and the Arabs, about ""common interests"" [and] about ""the possibility of unity and peace between two fraternal peoples."" ..... [But] we must not allow ourselves to be deluded by such illusive hopes ..... for if we ceases to look upon our land, the Land of Israel, as ours alone and we allow a partner into our estate- all content and meaning will be lost to our enterprise.‚Äù
- Moshe Sharett, the first Israeli foreign minister, 1914

""We must expropriate gently the private property on the state assigned to us. We shall try to spirit the penniless population across the border by procuring employment for it in the transit countries, while denying it employment in our country. The property owners will come over to our side. Both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discretely and circumspectly.‚Äù
- Theodor Herzl, 1895

‚ÄúZionism is a colonizing adventure and therefore it stands or falls by the question of armed force. It is important to build, it is important to speak Hebrew, but, unfortunately, it is even more important to be able to shoot.‚Äù
- commonly attributed to Ze‚Äôev (Vladimir) Jabotinsky, 1923

‚ÄúOur thought is that the colonisation of Palestine has to go in two directions: Jewish settlement in Eretz Israel and the resettlement of the Arabs of Eretz Israel in areas outside the country.‚Äù
- Leo Motzkin

‚ÄúIf the Jews at the end of the 19th century had not embarked on a project of reassembling the Jewish people in their ‚Äòpromised land‚Äô, all the refugees languishing in the camps would still be living in the villages from which they fled or were expelled.‚Äù
- Mordechai Baron IDF commander during the 48 war

‚ÄúWe must continually raise the demand that our land be returned to our possession .... If there are other inhabitants there, they must be transferred to some other place. We must take over the land. We have a great and nobler ideal than preserving several hundred thousands of Arab Fellahin‚Äù
‚Äî   Menachem Ussishkin, April 28 1930

I‚Äôm sure there are plenty more quotes such as these floating around. If anyone has any, feel free to enlighten me."

Yet amidst this genocide, our people in Gaza, across Palestine, and across the world remain steadfast in our resistance. The struggle continues.
On October 5, we will make clear from wherever we are that our movement is going nowhere until full liberation and return are ours. We will not stop, we will not rest, until every inch of Palestine is free.

1fufcsy,More women and children killed in Gaza by Israeli military than any other recent conflict in a single year,2024-10-02 12:47:52,317,https://www.oxfam.org.uk/media/press-releases/more-women-and-children-killed-in-gaza-by-israeli-military-than-any-other-recent-conflict-in-a-single-year/,"###Israeli explosive weapons hit civilian infrastructure in Gaza - including schools, hospitals and aid distribution points - once every three hours

More women and children have been killed in Gaza by the Israeli military over the past year than the equivalent period of any other conflict over the past two decades, new Oxfam analysis has found.

Conservative figures show that more than 6,000 women and 11,000 children were killed in Gaza by the Israeli military over the last 12 months. Data from 2004 - 2021 on direct conflict deaths from the Small Arms Survey estimates that the highest number of women killed in a single year was over 2,600 in Iraq in 2016.

A report by the organisation Every Casualty Counts examined information on over 11,000 children killed across the first 2.5 years of the Syria conflict, an average of over 4,700 deaths a year. UN Children and Armed Conflict reports over the last 18 years show that no other conflicts killed a higher number of children in one year.

Separate data from Action on Armed Violence up to 23 September shows that Israel hit civilian infrastructure across Gaza with explosive weapons once every three hours on average since the war began. Other than the six-day humanitarian pause last November, there were just two days in the entire year without bombardment.

Records - which are not comprehensive - show that Israeli explosive weapons hit on average:

* Homes every four hours
* Tents and temporary shelters every 17 hours
* Schools and hospitals every four days
* Aid distribution points and warehouses every 15 days

Civilian infrastructure has either been completely destroyed or severely damaged, including around 68 per cent of cropland and roads. Only 17 of 36 hospitals remain partially functional, and all suffer from a lack of fuel, medical supplies, and clean water.

Throughout the last year Israel has committed serious violations of International Humanitarian Law which may rise to the level of crimes against humanity. This includes a level of destruction that is indicative of Israel‚Äôs use of disproportionate force in relation to military objectives and a failure to discriminate between military targets and the civilian population. The Israeli military has relentlessly targeted infrastructure indispensable to civilian survival. Civilians have been forcibly displaced dozens of times to so-called ‚Äòsafe zones‚Äô that fail to meet basic humanitarian needs and have also been regularly bombed or attacked.

The UN Children and Armed Conflict reports show the number of Palestinian children killed in Gaza and the West Bank. Over the last year, more than five times more children were killed in Gaza than between 2005 and 2022 in total.

The record number of women and children killed in Gaza does not include those among nearly 20,000 people who are either unidentified, missing or entombed beneath the rubble and bomb debris.

Earlier this year, a study published in The Lancet estimated the true number of deaths in Gaza could be over 186,000, taking indirect deaths ‚Äì for example due to starvation and lack of health care ‚Äì into consideration."

1gcfga8,"Rewarding Bad Behavior - A Mistake Israel, Europe and the United States has Made and Continues to Make",2024-10-26 07:10:23,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1gcfga8/rewarding_bad_behavior_a_mistake_israel_europe/,"In my view, looking at things externally, as an African-American man, a passionate friend and defender of Israel and Jews, but not a evangelical Christian, Israel is making the classic mistake of rewarding and at least trying to appease terrorism and evil. Israel is far from alone in making this major mistake, many other countries, such as the United States, many European countries and UK make the exact same mistake. And it is a MAJOR mistake, because what you reward you get more of.

One of my main influences in this area, Dr. Tawfik Hamid, the great Arab Muslim reformer and thinker, former terrorist and current hero, has written at length about this over the years and I couldn't be in more agreement with what he has said on this subject.

Let's think about this logically. If you are a Palestinian who is in agreement with terrorism ideologically and you want money, notoriety and you want to be a hero and here that your family will be provided for, you will get a stipend if you commit an act of terrorism against innocent Jews, the more gruesome and horrible the act the more money you get, obviously this is a major incentive to carry out terrorist attacks. It isn't the government of Israel paying directly, but you have funding from the United States, Israel, Europe and others going to the PLO and the PLO is paying these stipends. So indirectly the United States, European and Israeli tax payers are ENCOURAGING and PAYING for terrorism.

It is the EXACT same with the so-called two state solution. At this point, giving PLO and Hamas a state, is giving them a huge reward for the evil crimes of October 7th. What do you think they are going to do if they get rewarded for October 7th. You really think this is going to result in less terrorism or more. I say things will become far worse, because you are rewarding bad behavior and this only teaches evil doers to do more evil.

Punishing bad behavior, punishing terrorism, can involve traditional wars and bombing and targeted assassinations, it can include that. But you know what is as effective or can even be even more effective? CUTTING THE FUNDING. 

That is one MAJOR, MAJOR criticism I have of the government of Israel and indeed of America. We are sending countless billions to Gaza, which ends up in the hands of Hamas and then billions to the West Bank which ends up in the pockets of President Abbas and his evil, terrorist supporting cronies and other terrorists. 

This is while nearly 30% of Israeli children live in poverty. 38% of Druze live in poverty. 14% of Orthodox Jews live in poverty. 35.3 Ultra Orthodox  Jews live in poverty. If I were Israel, I would UPLIFT MY OWN PEOPLE BEFORE SENDING MONEY TO A HOSTILE POPULATION THAT BELIEVES IN WIPING ME OUT. Again, I am not Israeli, this is just my view. I think it is ABSOLUTELY, F\*\*KING DISGUSTING, that billions go into the pockets of terrorists and criminals while loyal citizens SUFFER. If I were running things, the billions would go to LIFTING peaceful citizens out of poverty. Making sure that the 30% of Israeli children living in poverty get basic social services and those living in poverty get the necessary services and assistance to lift them out.  Also Israel needs to do a LOT more to help LOYAL minorities in the country. In other words ELIMINATING funding to terrorists and ensuring that loyal Jews and loyal Israeli minorities get the services and support they need. LOYAL people should be the priority when it comes to support and help...There was a case recently of a non-citizen, a Black Hebrew Israelite, who had joined the IDF and died defending the country. He wasn't even a citizen. Others in his community have joined the IDF to defend the country as well and support it. I would respond to this by ensuring they had necessary services and granting citizenship, that is what I would do... you want to be loyal, support Israel as the Jewish homeland and fight and die if necessary for the country, I don't care about their religion, welcome to Israel, that is my view...

Another way to fight terrorism, again, from Dr. Tawfik Hamid, my hero, is the morality and obligation to fight back against terrorism by LIVING and BUILDING in the Jewish historical homeland.

There is a lot of talk about so-called settlers and settlements, Jews living in peace in their homeland. Hamid has the PERFECT solution to this situation and controversy. Jews build and continue to build in these ""settlements"" as long as their is terrorism. In fact, for major terrorist attacks, you start legalizing and expanding settlements in a MAJOR way. You attack, you kill, we live, we expand would be the campaign. It is part of the response. The Hamas and PLO terrorists hate it, therefore it is a strong encouragement to not f\*\*k with Jews.

We talk about a two state solution, I could only see that when Arabs are detoxfied of this toxic deep hatred of Jews and other non-Arab Muslims. That is what I see. And after a PROLONGED period of peace. Minimally 10-20 years of no attacks. At MINIMUM. That is what I see...

When it comes to humanitarian aid to Palestinians, that is laudable and a good thing AFTER Israel takes care of their own people. This humanitarian aid should ONLY go to regions and groups that are peaceful towards Israel and respect the rights of Israel to exist as a Jewish state and don't encourage or condone terrorism..."

Do you think Israel has done anything to make the situation worse and encourage Palestinians to hate Israelis ? Was it better or worse before the Oslo accords? Do you think two peaceful states are ever possible?

It seems like the more isolated the two sides become from each other the less likely there will be peace one day. Maybe I‚Äôm too optimistic but I think it might still be possible. "

Hamas is a sick ideology, that is build on inhumane thoughts, antisemitism and the will to destroy the state of Israel.

This ideology is the main enemy, count Hamas, Fatah, PLO, PA, Hezbollah, or the Mullahs to this. They all part of this ideology and when people don't understand this, how can they fight this? They can't and allow it to continue.

How can we beat this ideology? For this we must understand how it can even spread and survive. It survives throught people, who carry hate in their heart, they keep it alive and spread it. (Parents, who give it to their children, as an example.)

The civilians in Gaza may share the thought with Hamas, that they want Israel destroyed, but they suffer because of Hamas and we must help them, do the right thing. (Love your enemy.) But we and everyone who wants peace and safe the children in Gaza must accept, that this narrative and this ideology survives, because it's in the head of the people in Gaza, they infected with this hate. 

So just taking Hamas out of power won't work, Israel, the UN, all countries on this planet must do everything to free these people, from this ideology, by giving them education, let them see, who the Israeli people really are, that they are not monsters, who wants them dead, but like them humans.

And people who doesn't want to accept that are warmongers, who doesn't care about children, civilians, peace, or the future.

Don't let this inhumane Ideologie survive, or every suffer was for nothing and after some time, we will stay again here. In a war, were even more innocent woman, children and men will die.

I have spent much time and effort over the past year (and prior) defending Israel in leftist spaces (I consider myself a leftist, or at least on the left).  A quick check of my comment history will show this.

But yesterday I read these articles.

https://www.democracynow.org/2024/10/16/gaza_doctor

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/09/opinion/gaza-doctor-interviews.html

Help me out.

What have we to say about this?  The IDF gives no statement.

I know bad shit happens in war, and I know Hamas is hoarding food, and I know they use child soldiers.

But preteen children, shot in the head?  Many of them?

Someone help me.

I am the person who, when I see an article titled ""IDF helps settlers attack palestinians"", I always look for the full story b/c often it's exactly the opposite.

But I can find nothing to ameliorate these claims by many different doctors, not all of them working for Hamas, many of them international volunteers, having the x-rays and such to back them up.

Anyone?

Those of us in the diaspora are working overtime trying to defend Israel's honor and reputation, and fight against the flood of misinformation and misinterpretation and outright (and subtle) antisemitism, and then I see something like this, and I dunno.

Someone please contextualize this.  If you can.

Todah."

I never had any Jewish friends, nor did I ever go to school with any, and although I‚Äôve befriended Palestinian-Americans, we never discussed the conflict. So your country‚Äôs history was largely new to me, and I‚Äôve tried to stay 
unbiased throughout my research as a result. 

But in my research, I can‚Äôt help but get the feeling that Israelis are better scholars. I‚Äôve been impressed by Benny Morris in particular, and have read nearly all of his works now. What frustrates me is that I can‚Äôt seem to find an equivalent to him on the other side. Khalidi and Pappe try to be, but Morris has thoroughly criticized both of their works as shoddy history. When I read Chomsky or Said, they‚Äôre both heavy on the moralizing language, and pretty light on the historical analysis. 

I thought I had something with Asma Al-Ghoul‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Rebel in Gaza.‚Äù But then I saw how ‚Äúhappy‚Äù she was on October 7, and that she thinks Palestinians have to stand by Hamas. I just can‚Äôt trust someone‚Äôs judgment if they can‚Äôt call out the obvious atrocities of that day. Generally, I‚Äôm just not interested in people who can only criticize in one direction. 

But I refuse to believe there aren‚Äôt reasonable voices to be heard. So I ask: who are those reasonable voices that you listen to, from the other side? There must be someone who‚Äôs said something that makes you think, or whose work has challenged you. If there are any books you recommend, I‚Äôd love to hear them. 

Thanks in advance. Your country has a fascinating history, and I love the challenge of figuring out who‚Äôs right about it. I hope to visit someday! "

I have been following the attack on Oct 7th and the subsequent war avidly as I, for one, do believe Israel has every right to defend itself and hunt down those who perpetrated the acts of Oct 7th.

What I'm confused about right now is the increase in Rocket Attacks on Northern Israel from Hezbollah.

Hamas is more or less decimated in Gaza, and IDF has made significant progress in Lebanon against Hezbollah. Their entire leadership is gone, quite a bit of weapons cache and terrorists eliminated.

I know the war is not over by any means and thousands of Hezbollah fighters remain in Lebanon, engaged in battle with IDF even as we speak.

However, at a time when I see the Hezbollah infrastructure weakening significantly in Lebanon and their resources declining, how is it that more Rockets are being fired by Hezbollah now then ever before?

I understand the Terrorists want for revenge and also, no leadership is required to fire Rockets. But after the amount of damage IDF did to their infrastructure and personnel, both South all the way to North Lebanon, how are there enough terrorists with enough weapons cache to increase the barrage of rockets being fired in Northern Israel?

Additionally, after making the significant gains which IDF did in Lebanon, and also seeing the increase in the rocket attacks from Lebanon, I would think a significant portion of IDF would be focused on eliminating the direct threat of terrorists along the South border who launch these rockets into Israel. 

I have seen several videos of IDF strikes on their Rocket Launchers, but again, the attack seems to be ""increasing"" rather than ""decreasing"".

Appreciate any insight. Thanks.

I just finished a 4-year study program in Germany and I am thinking about the future.

I was born and raised just outside of Tel Aviv. I am as Israeli as it gets. I did not serve in the military due to a health condition, so at 18 I decided to go on a little work and travel adventure in Europe and see where it would take me, so I moved to a small college town in Germany.

Problem is, things worked out a bit too well. I picked up the language and culture super quickly, built meaningful relationships with many people and have a promising career path. I definitely don't feel Germanized, but I absolutely love being an expat among expats.

One year ago I felt like a world citizen, like Israel and Germany were just different cities I could hop between whenever I felt like it. But since Oct 7 things feel different, I feel like no matter what I do or where I go, Israel will play a major role in how people see me, which makes me feel very connected to it. I almost see Israel as a family member that I don't want to leave behind just cause I'm having fun somewhere else lol. I miss my old and carefree mindset so much!

I am turning 24 next month and I am not sure what's next. The next logical step would be to move to a big, international city in Europe and keep living the life I enjoy, with all the interesting experiences one can only make abroad. At the same time, I really miss my family, childhood friends, weather, food etc in Israel. Weirdly, the worse the situation is back home, the more I wanna be there.

I've also realized that I never actually lived in my country as an adult, and it is something I would like to experience before I really get older, settle down and have a family. I am also worried that if I don't go back at 24-25, I will have little to come back to as everyone I know will be getting settled. I am just so unsure what to do since I like both lives so much and for radically different reasons... "

Over a long time,a marked difference in fertility rates could mean that jews become a minority ( it doesn't happen as it as we would think but it has happened in india as our native population is shrinking).My question is , is it something that jews are concerned about?

1gai2jf,Was the 1982 Lebanon war one of Israel's biggest mistakes?,2024-10-23 18:41:43,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1gai2jf/was_the_1982_lebanon_war_one_of_israels_biggest/,"
So as I was reading about the Lebanese civil war, and I noticed from the start of Lebanon's civil war until the 1982 invasion, Israel and Maronite Lebanese formed some sort of alliance against Muslim factions ( including PLO in Lebanon) and the Syrian army. Israel wanted to expel PLO from south Lebanon and install a pro-Israel Maronite Christian government, so they trained and supplied the Maronite forces.

However, the 1982 attack seemed to achieve neither of these goals, as it weakened their allies and made a future Maronite-Israel alliance difficult. not to mention in the long term it set the foundation for the formation of Hezbollah. but it did achieve the task of removing PLO from its northern border.

so the question is, could Israel have done this in another way? there were constant bombings by PLO against Israel at the time and for its security, Israel must have done something. not to mention having PLO right across the border was not acceptable to Israel's security. but the 1982 invasion (and subsequent occupation of south Lebanon) caused bigger problems in the long term. Israel could have helped create a friendly arab country in the 80s and secured one of its borders permanently. This could have been another 1978 Camp David Accords for Israel, but this time with Lebanese.

From a pragmatic pov, I think Israel maybe could have done things differently to achieve its goals, like simple things such as providing much more military support ( including air support when necessary) or sending soldiers with other uniforms so Maronite could take over south Lebanon and disarm PLO ( like Russia support for eastern Ukraine separatists in 2014).

So, do you guys agree with my take ? I'm no expert but I like to read about politics and history, so I would appreciate all opinions, especially from the experts in this field."

These are worse than their generals or fighters. They serve hezbollah and Iran intereset and they work against the lebanese people.

I know they were surrounded by civilians and local press but the IDF has been going a very good job issuing warnings for civilians to evacuate. Hezbollah terrorists needs to learn that they are no longer allowed to exist.

1g9xqcw,One Reason Israel is Losing the PR War - Education - Who Controls the Past Controls the Future,2024-10-23 00:38:42,163,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1g9xqcw/one_reason_israel_is_losing_the_pr_war_education/,"‚ÄúWho controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.‚Äù

‚Äï George Orwell, 1984 

In other words, those who control the narrative of history, through the education and media are able to shape public understanding and influence the present and future. 

I am not Jewish or Israeli. I don't have any Jewish or Israeli family, I am just an African-American friend and passionate supporter of Israel and the Jewish people. Many, many years ago I used to feel that Hamas was best for the Palestinian people and used to oppose foreign aid to Israel. Most of my Jewish friends at that time, either were neutral and didn't care, or mostly agreed with me in regards to cutting foreign aid to Israel...

I became pro-Israel through a long period of self-study and learning a lot more about the conflict. Studying and talking to BOTH sides, instead of just relying on a one sided narrative.

It wasn't that I hated anyone, I never hated anyone, it was just that I was not educated. Let's get real, if you knew nothing about Israel and Zionism and not only were you getting a particular message from the education system, your non-Jewish friends and even some of your other good friends, who were Jews, also mis-educated and misinformed, all gave you a particular narrative, naturally you would believe it. For example, let me give some examples from my life. Let's say you, like I was, were being fed an anti-Zionist narrative through professors and the media you watched. You talk to your Jewish friends and they express more of the same. Or they couldn't care about Israel either way. One of your good Jewish friends tells you that the underlying problem was that the entire country of Israel was an occupation, that the entire land was ""stolen."" Another Jewish friend told you that most of the problems in the Middle East were primarily caused by ""Khazar"" ""fake Jews"" (this was told to me by an Jewish Israeli friend of mine -- no she isn't African in case you were wondering...) How could you end up NOT ending up as an anti-Zionist hater of Israel. Unless you have been taught something else...

So I know of what I speak. it is a battle in the mind. An educational battle...

One major reason Israel is losing the PR is because they and their allies in the United States and Europe have almost entirely abandoned the education ""field of battle"" to their ideological enemies, Chinese and Russian communists, radical Islamists and far left activists. America, Europe and Israel all let their worse enemies fund and advise their education systems including their colleges. There ideological enemies are in almost complete control and are able to influence young minds and give them a one sided, propaganda based narrative in regards to Israel, the West and in regards to the rest of the world. The college encampments and huge anti-Israel protests are no surprise to me. if you have been indoctrinated in religious and ethnic hatred, that Jews and Israel are evil incarnate, well then how is someone going to end up not hating them.

The situation reminds me in many ways of the education system in certain parts of the United States right after the Civil War and during the Jim Crow era. You had widespread ""education,"" actually propaganda, on how slaves ""enjoyed"" slavery, how Africans were ""naturally inferior"" and a ""threat"" to white people and needed to be expelled to Africa. That Abraham Lincoln was an ""oppressor,"" that the Confederacy, ""opposed slavery,"" and the North ""occupied"" and ""oppressed"" the South. Every mistake of the Union army is amplified and every crime of the Confederacy is minimized to the point where it is basically nothing...

Just like certain anti-Zionist Jews today, during that time period and even today, there were African-Americans who had been so brainwashed that they actually hated themselves. They apologized and felt guilty for their own existence. Or they considered themselves somehow ""separate"" and ""superior"" to other African-Americans for whatever reason...There were even African-Americans who supported and stood with the Klan, just like today, some Jews stand with and support terrorists and terrorism...

You had this and all other kinds of nonsense being taught. What conclusions could someone indoctrinated in this kind of hatred and nonsense end up with. They are going to end up, after this ""education"" as a hard core racist unless they somehow get educated in the truth. That is the problem. A person educated in Neo-Confederate propaganda, someone raised being indoctrinated in all sides by Neo-Confederate propaganda is going to obviously end up being a racist -- how could they not?

If I had my way, if I had a magic wand and could change things, I would first take back the systems of education in Israel and in various Jewish educational institutions throughout the world. I would start by getting rid of all the propaganda BS that is taught in some (not all or most) of these schools. I think it is key, it is super key, that Jews themselves understand and are proud of their history and country. There is NOTHING to be ashamed of. You should be PROUD of your people, your history and your country, despite its faults it is LIGHT YEARS above nearly all other countries.

This is obvious when you look at how OTHER countries respond to similar threats. Even when you look at what Israel's neighbors have done and continue to do when the Palestinians have threatened them. That is a key point that is missing from both Jewish and non-Jewish education on the subject. 

We hear endless talk about the Nakba, where some Palestinians were expelled but a greater number were encouraged to leave the Palestinian mandate by their leaders and were assured they would be able to return once the Arab armies completed the Holocaust and murdered every last Jewish man, women and child. But we hear nothing about the Kuwaiti expulsion, where the Palestinian leadership supported Saddam and as a result Kuwait expelled hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, or the Iraqi expulsion, where the the Palestinians were rounded up and expelled by the Iraqi government. Or Black September where Jordan massacred up to 20,000 Palestinians once they threatened his regime. 

Another thing we never hear about, when we hear talk about the Nakba, is the Jewish Nakba, where nearly a million Jews were rounded up and expelled from THEIR communities by Arab leaders.

Or the history of Dhimmitude in the Ottoman and earlier Islamic empires, where Jews faced regular mis-treatment and periodic massacres. How they, and Christians were treated like sub-human trash by these empires. There certainly was not peace and mutual respect before Israel was established, what a total joke...

The fact that so many people, even the vast majority of young Jews I know don't know this kind of stuff is an indicator of the failure of the education system..."

In¬†[the video](https://youtu.be/zqwOt6Z3A0w?t=29)¬†published in English, Hebrew, and Arabic, two underground entrances are shown connected to the Al-Sahel building and Al-Ahmedi building both of which are located to each side of the hospital but are not directly connected to it.

Additionally, Israel's Arabic spokesperson¬†[Avichay Adraee](https://twitter.com/AvichayAdraee)¬†gave¬†[detailed instructions](https://twitter.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1848423905754493168)¬†in Arabic as to where the entrance and exit of the bunker could be found:

>Hezbollah keeps hundreds of millions of dollars in paper currency and gold under the Coastal Hospital in Haret Hreik to use for financing its terrorist activities.

>‚≠ïÔ∏è We reveal dangerous information about Hezbollah placing the shelter of the so-called Hassan Nasrallah under the Sahel Hospital located in the heart of Beirut.

>‚≠ïÔ∏è **The entrance and exit points are located inside the Al-Ahmadi Building and Al-Sahel Center Building.**

>‚≠ïÔ∏è Inside this shelter is a complex where hundreds of millions of dollars in paper currency and gold are kept, a large portion of which was taken from the citizens of the Lebanese state‚Äîfunds that could, and still can, rebuild the Lebanese state.

>‚≠ïÔ∏è The hospital's address is on Dargham Street, Airport Road, Haret Hreik.

>‚≠ïÔ∏è These funds are intended exclusively for arming the terrorist organization Hezbollah, with no other purpose.

>‚≠ïÔ∏è Air Force aircraft are currently reconning the complex. We are monitoring it and will continue to do so.

>‚≠ïÔ∏è We call on the Lebanese government, governing institutions, and international organizations to return the funds stolen from Lebanese citizens, and not to allow Hezbollah to use them for its terrorist purposes.

>‚≠ïÔ∏è Our war is not against the citizens of Lebanon, but against a bloody terrorist organization that Iran continues to arm and direct according to Iranian interests. üíö

Despite having clear instructions as to the entrance and exit of the bunker and being fully aware that it had no direct connection tot he hospital per the IDF's video, the BBC decided to tour the hospital itself rather than demanding to see the alleged entry and exit points exposed by the IDF.

It was at this time that Avichay put out a¬†[second Tweet](https://twitter.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1848644476287291576)¬†once again directing reporters to proper locations:

>To the media personnel who are currently participating in the media tour inside **#Sahel\_Hospital** in Haret Hreik‚Äîgo to the specific locations we have revealed and do not waste your time on theatrics inside the medical departments. Go down to Hezbollah's private shelter.

>Dargham Street, Building No. 7, Airport Road, Haret Hreik. **Entrance and exit in Al-Ahmadi Building and Sahel Center Building**.

>Go there.

This too was ignored by the BBC who then¬†[published a tour](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c9818n8v7d8o)¬†of Al Sahel Hospital where (naturally) nothing was found.

>To all the journalists in Beirut, including those who participated in the press tour in the Al-Sahel Hospital, these are the entry instructions to Nasrallah‚Äôs bunker we exposed yesterday:

>**According to intelligence information, one of the entrances to the bunker, containing more than half a billion dollars in gold and dollars, is on the eastern side of the basement of the Al-Ahmedi building, located south of the Al-Sahel hospital.**

>**The basement is on the second floor down (level -2).**

>**It is important to note that it is possible the entrance is hidden by various means in order to make it difficult to find.**

>We invite you to this site in which Hezbollah is holding money that was taken from the Lebanese people.

Despite having an obligation to seek out and report the facts, the BBC decided to abandon its journalistic obligations and instead carry water for Hezbollah by ignoring multiple detailed instructions on how to access the bunker opting for a performative ""investigation"" instead. In the end, the BBC got the headlines that it wanted but its readers did not get the truth.

Is Amos Oz read widely in Israel or only narrowly by liberal seculars inclined to agree with his peace-pointing efforts?

It seems me to me that Jews and Armenians have a lot in common, as does Israel and Armenia. Jews and Armenians have both suffered a genocide, Israel and Armenia are both very unpopular in the Middle East for being non-Muslim countries surrounded by Muslim neighbors. 

My understanding is that the international relations between Israel and Armenia are limited and not particularly warm. Perhaps for neither side is it seen as ‚Äústrategic‚Äù to align with a small unpopular country, but we have have many of the same enemies (Turkey and Islamic extremists like the Muslim brotherhood who can‚Äôt stand any non-Muslim countries in the Middle East for instance). I think there is an opportunity for these peoples and countries that can empathize with each other, perhaps better than anyone else in the world, to have warmer and stronger ties.

How the hell is an act of war NOT extraordinary circumstances?

I'm not even kidding, I argued with them for 2 days straight!!! I settled with them last night for $300 of the $850.

When signing up for a Twitch account, you can select an account verification method ‚Äì email or phone ‚Äì for added protection. Following the October 7, 2023 attacks, we temporarily disabled sign ups with email verification  in Israel and Palestine. We did this to prevent uploads of graphic material related to the attack and to protect the safety of users.

Signups were not disabled, and we continued to see sign ups from both regions. Users could choose to sign up with phone verification. We‚Äôve learned that, inadvertently, we did not re-enable email verification sign ups for either region.

We deeply regret this unacceptable miss, and the confusion it has caused. We‚Äôve fixed the issue, meaning all affected users can sign up with email verification.

We‚Äôve also heard concerns about whether our Community Guidelines apply to all content on our service. We continue to enforce our rules as consistently as possible, and are actively reviewing content and taking enforcement action where needed.

‚Äî

Readers added context:

>The ban was based on IP addresses, not email addresses (which in most cases cannot be geolocated based on the address only). Sign-up was impossible even when using a phone number.

Long story short is that the antisemitism is terrifying right now - the normalizing of it is so wild. 

I‚Äôm applying for Aliyah and family and friends are not supportive because there‚Äôs a war happening. 

I follow facts and data however and I‚Äôm aware of globally what‚Äôs happening - I would have to be completely living under a rock to think I don‚Äôt need an Israeli passport. I work in academia and it‚Äôs very bad here in the States, I need to move and I‚Äôm planning to attend Hebrew U. 

Am I nervous about the language, the cultural immersion, the fact I don‚Äôt have family there? YES. 

But I don‚Äôt see a future without an established connection, support and life in Israel.

So if you have data on safety in Israel, I would love it. Is Israel safer than the States? Is Israel the safest place we can be right now as Jews?

The Rabbinate doesn't make any real sense.

* It's not accepted by much of Israel's more moderate Jews.
* It's not accepted by much of Israel's Haredi Jews.
* It somehow dictates the validity of conversions to become Israeli citizens.
* It has a monopoly over things like Kashut certification.
* Marriages are either religiously valid or people fly over to Cyprus and it's just as valid in the eyes of the state.

Shouldn't it be liquidated and replaced with a mixture of governmental and confessional community authorities?

**Think about it.**

You set up a Ministry of Jewish Cultural Affairs which confers with Jewish authorities and establishes a universal standard for conversion recognition and things like Kashrut certification. Those standards are presented to all Jewish communities as the ""State Standard"" which means these are the bare minimum for state recognition.

* Communities who want higher standards are free to hold themselves to a higher standard. They wouldn't be denied from doing so.
* The state would have a Jewish Ministry directly involved in issues of marriages and burials and kashrut certification standards and so on.
* They can even investigate fraud within the Jewish community with regards to things like misuse of Kashrut certifications and the selling of fake or non-kosher Tefillin/Mezuzot.

Regardless, it doesn't overrule other communities who want to have higher standards or more stringent standards internally. The Haredi and similar will always be able to do what they wish to do.

If someone chooses to have a higher standard, let them advertise it. Nobody would be banned from that.

It just doesn't make sense why the state continues to maintain an institution which is universally hated. The only issue of Judaism I think both the Israeli and diaspora Jewish community have both come to agreement on is the Rabbinate is garbage and nobody likes it.

So why not go scorched earth and start from scratch?"

Jewish calendar seems to be very well adjusted to this specific region. I know that since Sukkot I can't smoke on my balcony at night without a t-shirt and rains are coming soon.

What are these people expected, that Israel just leaves? Did they learned nothing from the 2014 Gaza war? Hamas would now just rearm themself and after a few years, they would continue where they stopped, Hamas is more then just a government, you need to destroy, it's an ideology, thats in the head of the people in Gaza. An ideology build on hate, death and sacrifice of your own children.

Hamas and all the other terrorist groups wouldn't stop now, they fight to the death, they would rather want every child in Gaza see die, then making peace with Israel. 

So what I would ask these people in politic and who are activist, who now speaking about peace is, how many people, how many woman, children and men do you want to see die in the next war, which Hamas, or another terrorist group will start.

And of course the most important thing isn't even solved, the hostages, they are still being tortured and held captive in terror tunnels.

So if there is someone out there, who is politic active, or active in journalism, or has contacts in politic, can you ask these people, this question? Can you ask them how many people they want to see die, in the next war? 

Thank you."

Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezra as well as Daniel all portray the Persians extremely positively. For Fucks sake Cyrus (who is unquestionably still the Goated ruler in Iranian hearts) is mentioned by name as the anointed one. It is literally the Persians themselves who are the first to ask the children of Zion to return to Jerusalem and construct the second temple. I can tell you as someone who attended up to the first year of  high school in Iran, this is conveniently not mentioned anywhere. Their history books mention Cyrus as a benevolent ruler who treated his conquered lands well, and on the maps of the time the region of Israel is within his empire. But the connection is never made. I guess I'm curious if this history is as neglected in Israel as it is Iran. I really doubt it, and if so does this betrayal create an extra level of hurt in Israeli hearts? "

1g75061,Breaking Down Claims Of Starvation By The IPC,2024-10-19 09:12:59,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1g75061/breaking_down_claims_of_starvation_by_the_ipc/,"**What is the IPC?**

[According to its site](https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipcinfo-website/ipc-overview-and-classification-system/en/):

>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is an innovative multi-partner initiative for improving food security and nutrition analysis and decision-making. By using the IPC classification and analytical approach, Governments, UN Agencies, NGOs, civil society and other relevant actors, work together to determine the severity and magnitude of acute and chronic food insecurity, and acute malnutrition situations in a country, according to internationally-recognized scientific standards.

>The main goal of the IPC is to provide decision-makers with a rigorous, evidence- and consensus-based analysis of food insecurity and acute malnutrition situations, to inform emergency responses as well as medium- and long-term policy and programming.

>The IPC was originally developed in 2004 to be used in Somalia by FAO‚Äôs Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU). Since then, a global partnership of 15 organizations is leading the development and implementation of the IPC at global, regional and country level. With over 10 years of application, the IPC has proved to be one of the best practices in the global food security field, and a model of collaboration in over 30 countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia.

**Where is it being used in the context of the war in Gaza?**

The UN, other organizations, and the mainstream media use the IPC as a source to claim there are catastrophic levels of starvation in Gaza.

This can routinely be seen on the almost daily [flash updates](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-16-october-2024) published by The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs on its site where as of October 16th it claims 495k people in Gaza are facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity based on the IPC projection for May through September 2024.

https://preview.redd.it/qqnoawknxkvd1.png?width=1449&format=png&auto=webp&s=d86a72c9f365a5dfb5422b2a7d44df6d0ad1f778

>Note:

>While reviewing the details from my previous thread on the topic, I noticed a subtle but deceptive change in the wording used by the UN to describe food insecurity in Gaza. This dishonest framing replaces the word ""projected"" with ""facing"" creating the impression that Palestinians are facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity rather than it simply being a projection.

>It should also be mentioned that the projection currently in use by the UN was inflated by a staggering 115.3% (based on the most recent data published by the IPC) not only making it factually incorrect but resulting in the continued spread of disinformation regarding the war in Gaza.

https://preview.redd.it/jm3kfyne0lvd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=70d9d074814b4d214386f3c0d5343a8f5752a806

**What are the IPC food insecurity classifications?**

The IPC uses three food classifications, Acute Food Insecurity, Chronic Food Insecurity, and Acute Malnutrition.

https://preview.redd.it/imnhw3wjwkvd1.jpg?width=929&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7692d7fad108936a8f5bf48dbe2bd9143e22aaee

In the context of Gaza, only the Acute Food Insecurity scale is being used. As stated in the image above this classification ""Identifies areas and populations with food deprivation that threatens lives or livelihoods, regardless of the causes, context or duration.""

The Acute Food Insecurity scale is further broken down in the following chart:

https://preview.redd.it/pdbfpc8lwkvd1.jpg?width=925&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=050940868e2ec8c229b149b5e8b447a0128acdf6

What is the current and former IPC analysis for Gaza?

>Based on a [report](https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1156872/?iso3=PSE) published by the IPC on March 18th 2024, 30% of the population was facing Phase 5 catastrophic food insecurity between February and March with a projected 63.5% increase between March and July to 50%.

>On June 25th an [updated report](https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1157065/) was released showing 15% of the population facing Phase 5 catastrophic levels of food insecurity between May and June with a projected 44.5% increase between June and September to 22%.

>In the most [recent report](https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1157985/) published on October 17th, 6% of the population was reported to be facing Phase 5 catastrophic food insecurity between September and October with a projected 159.3% increase between November and April to 16%.

>Note:

>When comparing the projections of each report to subsequent reports we find that the report from March overestimated its projection by 105.4% while the report from June overestimated its projection by 115.3%.

>It should be noted that this calculation assumes the 'current' value in each analysis was accurately reported despite its extreme implausibility (detailed below).

**Combining the data with the IPC classification reference table with a primary focus on mortality:**

https://preview.redd.it/56pxe6tmwkvd1.jpg?width=817&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7be63231498f99a075d2fc766fcefd899b513a81

Based on the reference table, phases 3-5 are where malnutrition start impacting mortality. As such we will only calculate the expected deaths from these classifications for people in those groups.

**Feb-March**:

>26% of the population or 577,963 people were facing Phase 3 food insecurity. If we divide 577,963 by 10,000 people we get 57.7. We then multiply that by 0.5-0.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 28.8-57.1. This means between February and March (29 days) there would have been 835.2-1,655.9 Phase 3 starvation deaths during that time period.

>39% of the population or 875,618 people were facing Phase 4 food insecurity. If we divide 875,618 by 10,000 people we get 87.5. We then multiply that by 1-1.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 87.5-174.2. This means between February and March (29 days) there would have been 2,537.5-5,051.8 Phase 4 starvation deaths during that time period.

>30% of the population or 676,636 people were facing Phase 5 food insecurity. If we divide 676,636 by 10,000 people we get 67.6. We then multiply that by >2 to get an expected daily death rate of >135.3. This means between February and March (29 days) there would have been >3,923.7 Phase 5 starvation deaths during that time period.

Conclusion: According to the IPC there would have been **over 7,296.4-10,631.4 starvation deaths** during that period.

**March-July (projection):**

>12% of the population or 265,309 people were projected to face Phase 3 food insecurity. If we divide 265,309 by 10,000 people we get 26.5. We then multiply that by 0.5-0.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 13.2-26.2. This means between March and July (122 days) there are expected to be 1,610.4-3,204.4 Phase 3 starvation deaths during that time period.

>38% of the population or 854,290 people were projected to face Phase 4 food insecurity. If we divide 854,290 by 10,000 people we get 85.4. We then multiply that by 1-1.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 85.4-170. This means between March and July (122 days) there are expected to be 10,418.8-20,740 Phase 4 starvation deaths during that time period.

>50% of the population or 1,106,945 people were projected to face Phase 5 food insecurity. If we divide 1,106,945 by 10,000 people we get 110.6. We then multiply that by >2 to get an expected daily death rate of >221.3. This means between March and July (122 days) there are expected to be >27,009.4 Phase 5 starvation deaths during that time period.

Conclusion: According to the IPC there would have been **over 39,038.6-50,953.8 starvation deaths** during that period.

**May-June**:

>51% of the population or 1,148,301 people are facing Phase 3 food insecurity. If we divide 1,148,301 by 10,000 people we get 114.8. We then multiply that by 0.5-0.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 57.4-113.6. This means between May and June (31 days) there would have been 1,779.4-3,521.6 Phase 3 starvation deaths during that time period.

>29% of the population or 642,864 people are facing Phase 4 food insecurity. If we divide 642,864 by 10,000 people we get 64.2. We then multiply that by 1-1.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 64.2-127.9. This means between May and June (31 days) there would have been 1,990.2-3,964.9 Phase 4 starvation deaths during that time period.

>15% of the population or 342,719 people are facing Phase 5 food insecurity. If we divide 342,719 by 10,000 people we get 34.2. We then multiply that by >2 to get an expected daily death rate of >68.5. This means between May and June (31 days) there would have been >2,124.8 Phase 5 starvation deaths during that time period.

Conclusion: According to the IPC there would have been **over 5,894.4-9,611.3 starvation deaths** during that period.

**June-September:**

>41% of the population or 913,156 people are projected to face Phase 3 food insecurity. If we divide 913,156 by 10,000 people we get 91.3. We then multiply that by 0.5-0.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 45.6-90.4. This means between June and September (92 days) there are expected to be 4,195.2-8,316.8 Phase 3 starvation deaths during that time period.

>33% of the population or 745,437 people are projected to face Phase 4 food insecurity. If we divide 745,437 by 10,000 people we get 74.5. We then multiply that by 1-1.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 74.5-148.3. This means between June and September (92 days) there are expected to be 6,854-13,643.6 Phase 4 starvation deaths during that time period.

>22% of the population or 495,291 people are projected to face Phase 5 food insecurity. If we divide 495,291 by 10,000 people we get 49.5. We then multiply that by >2 to get an expected daily death rate of >99. This means between June and September (92 days) there are expected to be >9,113.3 Phase 5 starvation deaths during that time period.

Conclusion: According to the IPC there are expected to be **over 20,162.5-31,073.7 starvation deaths** during that period.

**September-October**:

>49% of the population or 1,044,353 people are facing Phase 3 food insecurity. If we divide 1,044,353 by 10,000 people we get 104.4. We then multiply that by 0.5-0.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 52.2-103.3. This means between September and October (30 days) there would have been 1,566-3,099 Phase 3 starvation deaths during that time period.

>31% of the population or 663,721 people are facing Phase 4 food insecurity. If we divide 663,721 by 10,000 people we get 66.3. We then multiply that by 1-1.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 66.3-131.9. This means between September and October (30 days) there would have been 1,989-3,957 Phase 4 starvation deaths during that time period.

>6% of the population or 132,987 people are facing Phase 5 food insecurity. If we divide 132,987 by 10,000 people we get 13.2. We then multiply that by >2 to get an expected daily death rate of >26.4. This means between September and October (30 days) there would have been >792 Phase 5 starvation deaths during that time period.

Conclusion: According to the IPC there would have been **over 4,347-7,848 starvation deaths** during that period.

**November-April:**

>34% of the population or 727,681 people are projected to face Phase 3 food insecurity. If we divide 727,681 by 10,000 people we get 72.7. We then multiply that by 0.5-0.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 36.3-71.9. This means between November and April (151 days) there are expected to be 5,481.3-10,856.9 Phase 3 starvation deaths during that time period.

>41% of the population or 875,573 people are projected to face Phase 4 food insecurity. If we divide 875,573 by 10,000 people we get 87.5. We then multiply that by 1-1.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 87.5-174.2. This means between November and April (151 days) there are expected to be 13,212-26,310 Phase 4 starvation deaths during that time period.

>16% of the population or 344,839 people are projected to face Phase 5 food insecurity. If we divide 344,839 by 10,000 people we get 34.4. We then multiply that by >2 to get an expected daily death rate of >68.9. This means between November and April (151 days) there are expected to be >10,414.1 Phase 5 starvation deaths during that time period.

Conclusion: According to the IPC there are expected to be **over 29,107.4-47,581 starvation deaths** during that period.

>Note:

>In the most recent report, the entire strip is falsely classified as being under IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) despite 63% of the population being in Phase 3 or lower. When divided by area, 65% of the Deir Al Balah & Khan Younis Governorates are Phase 3 or lower, 55% of the Northern Governorates are Phase 3 or lower, and 55% of the Rafah Governorate is Phase 3 or lower.

**After reviewing the data does it add up with on the ground reports of starvation deaths?**

According to a recent [report](https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/09/30/they-destroyed-what-was-inside-us/children-disabilities-amid-israels-attacks-gaza) by Human Rights Watch (citing the Hamas run Ministry of Health in Gaza), 38 people have died due to severe malnutrition (which includes those with pre-existing medical conditions and others who were not in a previously healthy state) since Oct 7th.

With such an obvious discrepancy between the IPC's projected deaths and actual deaths due to starvation we can conclude that the estimates provided by the IPC (which are uncritically parroted by almost every mainstream media outlet, the UN, and various human rights organizations) do not accurately reflect the facts on the ground and even the most recent projection published a few days ago overestimates the expected starvation deaths by an extreme degree.

**How did the IPC come to such a conclusion considering the lack of evidence supporting it?**

For this I suggest reading a [report](https://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_Famine_Review_Committee_Report_Gaza_June2024.pdf) published by the Famine Review Committee in June which found that there was no evidence to support the analysis provided by the IPC or famine in general:

>Following the publication of the second FRC report on 18 March 2024, which projected that a Famine would occur in the most likely scenario, a number of important developments occurred. In contrast with the assumptions made for the projection period (March ‚Äì July 2024), the amount of food and non-food commodities allowed into the northern governorates increased. Additionally, the response in the nutrition, water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and health sectors was scaled up. In this context, **the available evidence does not indicate that Famine is currently occurring**.

A [similar report](https://www.gov.il/en/pages/the-third-ipc-report-on-gaza-june-2024-3-sep-2024) also reviewed what details were ignored by the IPC resulting in incorrect food insecurity classifications:

>The accumulation of unique and problematic practices in the IPC reports on Gaza since December 2023 point to a systemic failure by the FRC to ensure compliance with the most basic IPC standards and principles when it comes to this situation.

>

>The expressly biased descriptions of events, coupled with the lack of transparency throughout the process ‚Äì from the identity of the organizations in the Analysis Team, through the details of the ""non-TWG analysis process,"" to the extensive reliance on sources that are factually or methodologically flawed ‚Äì raises serious doubts regarding the neutrality and impartiality of the IPC reports on Gaza, and hence on their credibility.

>

>Hamas' October 7th atrocities, including the taking of over 200 hostages, and its use of civilians as human shields at an unprecedented scale are the cause of the large-scale destruction in Gaza and the serious hardship suffered by its population. Addressing the food security crisis which ensued is a complicated challenge which requires, first and foremost, a reliable and accurate analysis. Sadly, after three reports, it is clear by now that the IPC has been providing a highly misleading picture of reality and projections which are divorced from the actual trends on the ground.

>

>The pattern emerging raises concern that at least some of the organizations involved in the IPC have instrumentalized the analysis process for their campaign to force Israel into an unconditional ceasefire, without the release of its hostages or the removal of Hamas' genocidal threat. Some IPC partner organizations have also been lobbying openly for a weapons embargo on Israel and Hamas (but focusing only on countries supplying them to Israel)  and for other legal measures against Israel, including the issuing of arrest warrants by the ICC. The skewed IPC reports on Gaza thus became the primary ""evidence"" for the libel that Israel has a policy of intentionally starving Gaza's population, making it appear as a plausible accusation in the public, political and academic discourses, as well as in the highest institutions of international law. That is not robust humanitarian advocacy, but a dangerous and irresponsible, even if unintentional, fueling of hate.

**This brings us to the most important question for you to ask yourselves, was this malice or stupidity and if it was the former why is the IPC intentionally lying about the situation in Gaza?**

These settlements cost millions to protect and maintain due to the security risks. There is often violence between Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank which is not always dealt with fairly by the IDF. The risks in Gaza of extremist movements, especially after a war, is very high. 

2-If Israel chooses to annex part or all of the Gaza Strip and builds settlements without allowing Palestinians to return the allegations of ethnic cleansing will be correct. They were displaced for their own safety during the war but refusing to allow them to return would mean they were ethnically cleansed.

3- Israel is in the process of normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia which would be a great ally for them against Iran. Settling the Gaza Strip could jeopardize this deal. 

4-Israel is surrounded by enemies and must try to maintain relations with the only two neutral countries nearby (Jordan and Egypt). Re-settling Gaza could fuel ideas of Israeli expansionism and militarism which may damage their relationship with these nations. 

5- The settlements in the West Bank have significantly increased tensions with the PA and are often used by anti Israel activists to promote the idea that Israel doesn‚Äôt want peace. They have very little benefit to Israeli society overall. Regardless of what you think of the PA they‚Äôre still the government in the West Bank and Israel needs to try to work with them. 

6-The costs associated with ensuring that there are no more extremists groups in Gaza like Hamas would be significantly increase with an Israeli civilian population present in the territory. 

7-It may be necessary to build fences or gates to separate these settlements from other Palestinian communities making travel between Israel and Gaza very challenging and dangerous. Many around the world could also see this as an unjust system. 

Are there any counterpoints to these? What do Israelis think? Only a small minority in Israel think the same thing as Smotrovich and Ben Gvir luckily. "

Just wanted to write my thoughts on this whole situation based on my intuition.

Throughout this past year I have seen many people in my country talking shit about Israel, from my very own family to politicians who are in the current government. University campuses are full of ignorant LGTB kids who think they‚Äôre fighting for freedom being openly antisemitic and in reality they are defending people who would also punish or even kill them for being homosexual. These days are just crazy, whenever I watch the news I see ‚ÄúIsrael *attacks* this part of Lebanon or ‚Äúis planning an offensive‚Äù like if you would do this war thing for mere pleasure or something.
 
I admire how you Israelis are handling this situation, with half of the planet thinking that you guys are evil genocides. You are keeping a well organized western civilization in the middle of a region full of problems and countries that are willing to destroy even the last remain of you (spoiler alert: they won‚Äôt). 

Also, as an agricultural engineer I want to thank you for the invention of drip irrigation. I truly appreciate how did you manage to create such a prosperous country in the middle of arid climate and surrounded by a hostile atmosphere.

btw, I have never been to Israel, so this are just my 2cts.

Several ministers and MKs from Likud and Otzma Yehudit are expected to attend

An invitation from Likud, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's party, to an event near the Gaza border has been circulated under the title ""Preparing to Settle Gaza.""

The event, scheduled for next week, will feature the construction of a sukkah as part of a ""city of sukkahs"" initiative by the Nachala movement, which is known for establishing illegal outposts in the West Bank.

Social Equality Minister May Golan, along with MKs Tally Gotliv, Osher Shkalim and Hanoch Milwidsky, confirmed to Haaretz that they will attend the event. The invitation also mentions that six other Likud MKs are expected to participate.

The Nachala movement stated that ""the event is not just a theoretical conference, but a practical exercise and preparation for renewed settlement in Gaza."" The movement added that ""the return to settlement in Gaza is no longer just an idea but a process that is already in advanced stages, with government and public support.""

According to the movement's announcement, ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir, Bezalel Smotrich, Amichai Eliyahu, and Yitzhak Wasserlauf are also expected to attend the event.

The event is slated to include a tour of Kibbutz Nirim, but the kibbutz issued a statement saying, ""No tour was coordinated with Nirim. The security coordinator has not been contacted, and we do not agree to this, so it will not take place.""

The kibbutz added, ""We are still waiting for the government and coalition members to take responsibility for the catastrophic failures of October 7 and for the deep wound still in our hearts. Instead of holding political events aimed at establishing settlements, the government should focus on bringing home the 101 hostages and supporting the reconstruction of Gaza border communities.""

Throughout the war, Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly stated that Israel has no intention of establishing settlements in Gaza. He reiterated this in his speech to the U.S. Congress in late July.

In June, during an interview on Channel 14, Netanyahu rejected a proposal from host Yinon Magal to settle Gaza and ""exact a price from Hamas,"" stating, ""It may be that many think this way, but I do not believe it is realistic or serves the goals of the war.""

In a May interview with CNN, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the reestablishment of settlements in Gaza was ""never in the cards.""

""I said so openly [and] some of my constituents are not happy about it, but that's my position,"" Netanyahu said."
1g6w27j,Need Resources to Counter Pro Palis Propaganda ,2024-10-18 23:46:42,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1g6w27j/need_resources_to_counter_pro_palis_propaganda/,"Hey everyone,

I recently found myself in a heated panel on TikTok that was unexpectedly pro-Palestinian. I joined because I saw the host was Jewish, and I thought we‚Äôd have some reasonable, balanced discussion. However, the host kept inviting a lot of pro-Palestinian speakers, many of whom were Egyptian, and they started pulling out all sorts of historical events (wars between Egypt, Lebanon, and Israel, etc.) to demonize Israel.

- They claimed that Zionism is inherently antisemitic, and being a Zionist contradicts supporting Jewish people.

- They argued that Israel is a colonial project and that Zionists colonized Palestinian land, ignoring the Jewish historical connection to the region and the legal purchase of land.

- They suggested that Jews should ‚Äúgo back to their homeland‚Äù and that Israel‚Äôs establishment is illegitimate, which seemed to deny Israel‚Äôs right to exist. And brought up historical wars like the Suez Crisis (1956), the Six-Day War (1967), and the Yom Kippur War (1973) to justify hostility toward Israel, even though Egypt has a peace treaty with Israel now.

They referenced incidents like the Bahr el-Baqar school bombing (1970) to demonize Israel and paint it as responsible for civilian deaths.

They continuously used past sources and events to discredit Israel, making it seem like supporting Israel equals supporting oppression.
To be honest, I felt caught off guard. They used these ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù moments, referencing past wars and events to attack Israel, and I wasn‚Äôt fully prepared to respond. I know Egypt is in a peace treaty with Israel, and it feels wrong seeing Egyptians being so anti-Israel, especially when we‚Äôve moved toward peace.

I‚Äôm well-educated on many topics, but I didn‚Äôt expect this level of historical referencing and intense bias against Israel. They seemed to think I was justifying colonialism, and it made the discussion difficult to manage.

Can anyone recommend resources (books, articles, videos) or even strategies to help me better respond to these kinds of claims in the future? I want to be well-prepared to handle these pro-Palestinian talking points and propaganda, especially when they bring up historical events in an attempt to demonize Israel.

Thanks in advance for your help!"

1g6h7f1,Debunking the ‚ÄúThree Oaths‚Äù Argument Against Israel,2024-10-18 12:46:29,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1g6h7f1/debunking_the_three_oaths_argument_against_israel/,"There are many anti-Israel voices that use the ‚ÄúThree Oaths‚Äù mentioned in the Talmud as a reason why Jews supposedly shouldn‚Äôt be in Israel today. They argue that Jews are betraying these oaths and that Israel shouldn‚Äôt exist because of them. But this argument is misleading and ignores the actual context of Jewish history and the creation of the State of Israel.

First, let me explain what the ‚ÄúThree Oaths‚Äù are. According to the Talmud, after the destruction of the Second Temple and the beginning of exile, the Jewish people were bound by three oaths:

1.	Jews should not ‚Äúascend [to the Land of Israel] as a wall,‚Äù meaning by force.

2.	Jews should not rebel against the nations.

3.	The nations should not oppress Israel too much.

Some anti-Israel individuals claim that by re-establishing the State of Israel, Jews are violating these oaths, particularly the first one about not returning to the land by force. However, this interpretation is not accurate for a few key reasons:

1.	The Return to Israel Was Not by Force: The modern return to Israel happened gradually, through immigration and political negotiations‚Äînot through military conquest. The Jewish population increased over time, and the United Nations presented a plan in 1947 that offered both Jews and Palestinians a state. Despite the UN offering Jews a smaller portion of land, we accepted the plan in good faith, while many Arab states rejected it. The creation of Israel was endorsed by international law, not by force.

2.	We Fought in Defense, Not Conquest: After the UN proposed the partition plan, it was the surrounding Arab nations who attacked Israel, leading to the 1948 War of Independence. Israel had to defend itself, and through that defense, we maintained our state. It wasn‚Äôt that we went to war to conquer the land‚Äîit was about survival and self-defense.

3.	The Context of the Oaths: Many Jewish scholars argue that the Three Oaths were specific to the time of exile and were never meant to be binding forever. Additionally, the third oath is often overlooked: the nations should not oppress Israel excessively. Given the atrocities of the Holocaust, it‚Äôs hard to argue that the world upheld this part of the oaths, which further undermines the argument.

The modern State of Israel came into existence through legal international agreements, not by breaking the Three Oaths. The claim that Israel‚Äôs existence violates Jewish law is a distortion of history and Jewish teachings. The truth is, Israel was established through diplomacy, and the wars we fought were to defend ourselves, not to take land by force."

I have this running through my head, and I would love honest opinions and to start a discussion, wondering what historians will say about this time in history.

Right now, *all other issues aside* (because there are too many if them and I want to just discuss *one*), do you think Netanyahu has been the right leader at the right time for Israel? 

Is there another person who could have been PM over the last year (and yes I am going to leave out the ""he missed / ignored signs of the attack"", because that is abhorrent; I'm not excusing him) that would have said ""we are going to finish Iranian terror proxies one by one, and IDFAFxwhat our 'allies' or the UN says"" and actually delivered on that? 

Look at the terrorist infrastructure, including leaders, that have been eliminated. Could anyone but Netanyahu accomplished *on this front* what he did in a year? Has he actually been the leader Israel needed *at this time, on this issue only*?

I want to add, before this is a talking point, that I know many want a ceasefire and a release of the hostages.  Who has Netanyahu *really* had to negotiate that with (in good faith)? I have prayed and cried, very literally, for the hostages and their families every day and night since 10/7/23. Is it ""fair"" to say he failed them by not getting them all released?

Iran looks inept.

Israeli forces demonstrated their capacity to ensure regional peace.

Time for the Saudis to sign the security agreement with Israel that October 7th was meant to prevent. They can fund and manage the building of a peaceful Gaza and Southern Lebanon.

‚ÄúHamas will no longer rule Gaza,‚Äù Netanyahu promises in a video statement. ‚ÄúThis is the beginning of the day after Hamas, and this is an opportunity for you, the residents of Gaza, to finally break free from its tyranny.‚Äù

Turning to the hostage families, Netanyahu says this is ‚Äúan important moment‚Äù in the war. ‚ÄúWe will continue with all our strength until the return of all of your loved ones, who are our loved ones.‚Äù

Netanyahu then turns to Gazan civilians: ‚ÄúSinwar ruined your life. He told you he was a lion, but in reality he was hiding in a dark den. And he was killed when he fled in a panic from our soldiers.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo the Hamas terrorists I say: your leaders are fleeing and they will be eliminated,‚Äù he continues.

He says that anyone holding hostages will be allowed to live if they lay down their weapons and release their captives.

‚ÄúAnd at the same time I say, whoever harms our hostages, his blood will be on his head,‚Äù says Netanyahu. ‚Äù We will come to a reckoning with him.‚Äù

Netanyahu says freeing the hostages brings the end of the war closer.

Addressing the people of the Middle East, Netanyahu says there is ‚Äúa great opportunity to stop the axis of evil and create a different future.‚Äù

Netanyahu says that Sinwar‚Äôs killing makes clear to critics in Israel and abroad why his government insisted on continuing the war. ‚ÄúWhy we insisted, in the face of all the pressures, to enter Rafah, the fortified stronghold of Hamas where Sinwar and many of the murderers hid.‚Äù‚Äù"

On behalf of the ""Corriere della Sera,"" I spent two weeks in Israel. I had never been there. Or, rather, I had been there a couple of times in my travels in the Far East, but I had never stopped there. This time my intention was to quarter myself in Jerusalem and, with the help of my Israeli friends, who know more about this subject than anyone else, study the whole situation in the Arab countries, which surround and threaten the new Jewish state. 


But, after a couple of days I had abandoned the project, in fact I had completely forgotten about it, all caught up as I was in the interest that local things aroused in me. And, instead of staying in the capital poking around in the archives of the Foreign Ministry and gathering the confidences of the various intelligence services about what was happening across the border between the Nassers, the Kassems and the Husseins, I spent my time wandering through the fertile plains of the upper and lower Galilee and the Negev desert.


The fruit of my observations are the articles that appear in the ""Corriere della Sera,"" and I do not intend to duplicate them here.
 I just want to explain to my readers of the ""Sunday"" why Israel made such an impression on me that I set aside the program I had mapped out before coming there and on which I had also made a definite commitment to the newspaper. 


And the reason is this: that finally in Israel I saw documented in facts a truth in which, underneath, I had always believed, but of which I lacked proof: namely, that it is not countries that make men, but men that make countries. 


So that when we say ""developed zone,"" we must imply energetic and active men and peoples; and when we say ""depressed zone,"" we must imply depressed men and peoples. All other reasons for depression - climate, hydrography, orography, etc. - are merely convenient excuses when they are not even the result of human incapacity and sloth.


Israel, as long as it was an Arab country, that is, until about thirty years ago, was exactly like Egypt (without the Nile), Jordan and Saudi Arabia, with which it borders: a barren and thirsty heath, without a tree, a succession of yellow and stony hills, on which the goats had devoured every last blade of grass and of which the uncontested lords were the crows and jackals. Such areas in the country are still there, mind you, here and there, in patches. They are the ones where the Arabs have stayed. They have water, now, because the Jews went after it in the Jordan River and Lake Tiberias. And with a system of aqueducts from there they brought it to irrigate the whole country. And they also have tractors, because the government gives them tractors. And they also have the assistance of technicians, because the state provides them. And they even have, all around them, the example and the practical lesson of how to turn a barren and inhospitable land into a paradise of citrus groves, pine and cypress forests, lush vegetable gardens, wheat and cotton fields. Yet, they take little or no advantage of it.


Their villages have remained dreadful hemlocks, their
still-nailed plow merely scratches the surface of the earth without bothering to recreate a ""humus"" on it, their axe ruthlessly cuts down trees, and their goats nip in the bud every hint of vegetation. They are by no means ""the children of the desert,"" as they are called in the rhetoric of those who, of the Arab countries, know only ""The Arabian Nights."" They are its fathers. They are not the victims of an inclement climate: ""they are the ones who caused and aggravated it, especially by destroying the forests. And if they suffer thirst, it must be said that they have brought it on themselves by giving up through sloth to regulate the waters, to retain rain in reservoirs and redistribute it with canals. 


I finally understood why the Arabs hate the Jews so much. It is not race. It is not the religion, which sobers them against them. It is the indictment, it is the condemnation, that Jews represent, in the eyes of the whole world, here in their own lands, against their sloth, their lack of goodwill, commitment to work, pioneering enthusiasm, organizational intelligence.


For Israel proves that this is precisely what the depressed areas of the Middle East lack. It is the people who inhabit them, not nature or the good Lord, who made them so. the Jews took them as they were, that is, as other countries all around are: with that scorching sun, with that lack of atmospheric precipitation, with those sand dunes, with those desolate brugheires, with those mosques, with that malaria. 


And in thirty years of hard work, each individual postponing his own individual gain to the interest of all, each generation, sacrificing its own convenience for the sake of the next, of the Palestinian depressed area they made the Po Valley. 


Today this country is in the midst of an overproduction crisis. It no longer knows where to put its wheat, its eggs, its chickens, its cotton, its oranges and its grapefruits. Its milk production is proportionately the second largest in the world, beaten only by that of the Netherlands: which means that from the stony ground it has also drawn wonderful pastures. In thirty years it has planted over thirty million trees, and anyone who dares to touch one goes to jail.


And the climate in thirty years has also changed, because of the forests and irrigation. It was this marvelous human adventure that mesmerized me, overshadowing my interest (and unfortunately the newspaper's as well) in Middle Eastern politics. 
For it answered precisely, with resounding and indisputable facts, the question I had always asked myself: namely, whether it is countries that make men, or men that make countries. 


My friends, it is men who make countries: men and only men, their will, their toil, their ability to believe and sacrifice for what they believe. Depressed areas exist only there, in their resigned souls, in their sluggish muscles, in their indolent brains, in their renunciation of struggle, in the morality of ""getting by"" and ""who makes me do it?"" in short, in the lack of a religious sense of life, and thus in the disposition to derive only immediate profits and enjoyments from it.

Genocide refers to violence that specifically targets individuals based on their membership in a particular group, with the ultimate goal of destroying that group. The Holocaust stands as a devastating example of genocide, where an estimated 6 million Jews were systematically murdered during World War II. The global Jewish population has never fully recovered from this atrocity, which accounted for approximately **0.26%** of the world population at the time (2.3 billion in 1940).

The average daily death toll during the Holocaust was around **4,110 Jews per day** over four years, reflecting the immense scale of destruction. In contrast, the ongoing conflict in Gaza, which began on October 7, 2023, has resulted in approximately **41,802 Palestinian deaths** as of mid-October 2024, with an average of **111 deaths per day**. Although tragic, this figure accounts for around **0.00051%** of today's global population, which stands at **8.18 billion**‚Äã

[CountryMeters](https://countrymeters.info/en/World)‚Äã

[Nations Geo | Population](https://nationsgeo.com/population/).

¬†

When discussing genocide, it's important to consider the scale and intent behind the violence. The Holocaust sought the complete annihilation of a people, whereas current conflicts, while devastating, differ in scale and context. The use of the term ""genocide"" should be approached with caution, as it carries specific legal and historical implications. The comparison highlights the difference between large-scale extermination efforts during WWII and the current violence in Gaza, underscoring the need for precise language when addressing such events.

What status do you think will be conferred upon WB Palestinians? If the status is ""**residence**"", then will they have to prove their ""center of life"" in the few WB cities in Area A? Basically, will Israel have an addition of approximately 2.5 - 2.7 million residents with roughly the same status as Jerusalemite Arabs? 

The reason I am curious about this, is that on Oct 31st 2024 (unless something big changes!), Palestinian Authority banks and by extension their financial system will start to collapse, because Smotrich did not extend an Israeli authorization needed by Palestinian banks in order to function. That, coupled with the already deeply anemic nature of the Palestinian Authority means that it is very likely to collapse, leaving Israel to deal with the mess.

Apparently it always start small, like doing graffiti against Netanyahu etc, it makes me think... how many graffities have i seen against netanyahu  recently that was painted with iranian money? In a different case, he got paid for posting himself throwing wood in fires started in protests against Netanyahu, another food for thought. Important: Im not saying the people who protest against Netanyahu are getting money from Iran, hell no. Most of them are very zionists and love the country, im just saying, iran is trying to use these protests for something bad, like that few cases where they paid a few people to go there and cause trouble, its only few people, if at all. 99.99% of people there protest out of love for the country/hate for bibi and got nothing to do with iran.

The last one is... most of them are people from Russia/Ukraine who only in the last few years moved to israel, i guess they are easier to enlist cause they dont feel as strong connection to israel as the rest of us do.

Its a bit worrying people would sell their country for a few dollars, they should sit in prison for life."

1g4s7o0,Is it possible to completely pacify Gaza and the West Bank by using divide+conquer and carrot+stick techniques?,2024-10-16 05:34:22,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1g4s7o0/is_it_possible_to_completely_pacify_gaza_and_the/,"Today I listened to a Jewish gentleman from IPF give a talk about the war and his belief on where Bibi went wrong. During question time, a woman told a story about being a victim of Islamic driven destruction of her business, and asked how he believed peace could ever be possible with Islamic extremists.

Her question was interesting imo: *What if the Palestinians, and the wider Muslim world, simply never ever come to want peace with Israel? What then?*

After some thought, perhaps could Israel could look at what China did in Hong Kong after the protests there. China:

1. Quickly exiled the protest leaders by coercing (one way or another) them into leaving, and simply never letting them back in.
2. Carrot and stick - China gives cash gifts to HK residents for complacency.
3. Divide and conquer - China approves whether politicians can run based on them agreeing with CCP rule, creating a resented ruling body, and an agitator underbody. Eventually the population will be split in their feeling between the two political classes, dividing the population.

Israel could follow a similar policy in both Gaza (and Lebanon with restrictions). No need to fully destroy Hamas:

* Initial peace deal: Give the leaders exile in Qatar, in exchange for the hostages.
* The Gazan people will now be demoralized given Hamas leaders have fled, and their bargaining chip is gone. Reward really well any weapon turned over. This will encourage desperate people to start turning over weapons.
* Incentivize Gaza residents towards peace with minimal ongoing payments and rewards that are just enough to leave them content but not enough to take it for granted. Give them nothing extra.
* Don't let any 3rd party freely give aid or payments - it all goes through Israel, so that Israel can control the tap.
* If some Gazans or areas of Gaza will not cooperate, isolate and remove any reward from them.
* Keep exiling individuals who make too much noise (e.g. pay Afghanistan to quietly take them).
* Bring back Fatah, Hamas, and another group - but this time sow discord between the different groups. E.g. Have the new Hamas leader ""killed by the new Fatah"". A few weeks later, vice versa.
* Play more political games. E.g. Reward some areas of Gaza more for absolutely no reason, but make sure other areas know. Spread rumours that they were more friendly to Israel - sow resentment.
* If none of the above is working, flood the area with highly addictive drugs, which will erode social cohesion by causing internal conflict on how to handle addicts.
* Etc, continue with carot and stick, and divide and concequer techniques.

None of this is that ethical, but I see no other way the war can end. I doubt Hamas can be 100% removed, even if they were likely Palestinians will never want peace or a two state solution, and (actual) genocide isn't an option. The only way is to keep them so busy they have no time for focusing on Israel."

>  
>For those European elites, the right of self-determination of the French, Palestinians, or Chinese, is framed as a matter of justice: an inherent, unconditional right of a people to their land. **But when it comes to the Jews, the narrative shifts. Their right to self-determination is not viewed as intrinsic, but as an act of European compassion‚Äîgranted out of guilt for the Holocaust**. In this view, Israel exists not because of a millennia-old connection to the land, or because of global rejection or because of Zionist activity, but because Europe, burdened by its conscience, graciously allowed the Jews a state through the UN.  
>  
>This paternalist narrative strips Jews of their agency and their deep historical ties to Israel. But much worse, it turns their right to a homeland into something conditional‚Äîa ‚Äúgift‚Äù from Europe. And like any gift, it can be revoked if the recipient misbehaves.  
>  
>And this is where the obsession with Israel kicks in. **If Europe believes it bestowed Israel‚Äôs right to exist, then it assumes the authority to judge Israel‚Äôs conduct**. The Jews, unlike other nations, are expected to earn their right to sovereignty daily by conforming to the standards set by their ‚Äúbenefactors.‚Äù Fail to do so, and the right that was ‚Äúgiven‚Äù can be questioned‚Äîor withdrawn.

To which Bibi correctly replied: ‚ÄúA reminder to the president of France: It was not the UN resolution that established the State of Israel, but rather the victory achieved in the War of Independence with the blood of heroic fighters, many of whom were Holocaust survivors ‚Äî including from the Vichy regime in France.‚Äù"

I have a deep interest in history and culture, which makes Jerusalem a must-visit destination for me. Tel Aviv also greatly appeals to me. However, given the current tensions in the region, I would appreciate hearing local perspectives‚Äîthese seem far more reliable than the opinions of many people online who have never visited Israel.

Below are a few questions I hope you can help me with. I would be very grateful for your insights!

1. **Airstrikes.** I‚Äôve downloaded the Red Alert app on my phone and have been following the updates for Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. When Iran launched missiles recently, I was woken up several times, but things have been calmer over the past few days. Does this suggest that I shouldn't worry too much about the situation? Which channels should I follow to stay updated on Iran and Hezbollah's movements?
2. **Terror attacks.** The recent terror attack in Tel Aviv was shocking. How are locals perceiving this event? Was it an isolated ""lone wolf"" attack, or part of a more systematic targeting of civilians? How can I stay informed about the latest security updates?
3. **Flights.** I‚Äôll be flying from the UAE, and it seems that flights in and out of Tel Aviv from Dubai are priced around $200 at the moment. Does that seem reasonable? What are the chances of flight cancellations? A silly question, but could rocket fire affect flights?
4. **US Travel Advisory**. I‚Äôve been following the U.S. Department of State‚Äôs travel advisories for Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and they are currently at Level 3 ‚Äì Reconsider Travel. It seems like it should be okay as long as I mainly stay in these two cities. Would you agree with that?
5. **Additional suggestions.** Do you have any extra safety tips? For example, are there specific areas or times of day I should avoid? Would it be safer for me to head straight to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv‚Äôs airport? Any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated!"

In that post I made clear that I stand with Israel since Oct.7th, have ever since and will until Hamas, Hezbollan and the IGRC are crushed. But with the recent news coverage I feel burnt out.

Ever since the UNIFIL incident happened, calls in the SPD (governmental party) and the Greens have arisen for a ""differenciated"" view on Israel and to remove Israel's security as ""Staatsr√§son"" (state priority is the best translation), the Hamasniks become seemingly more brazen and now we have had Islamists demonstrating in Hamburg last Sunday. Not to forget that Baerbock (Greens, foreign minister) met with anti-Israel activists and refuses to name anyone.

I feel like the Hamas propaganda is becoming victorious, people who formerly supported Israel are now way more hesitant, citing civilian suffering and now Lebanon. They either don't see or don't care WHY Israel does this, all they see is news of destroyed homes, dispersed families and civilian suffering.

I am just so burnt out. I feel more and more isolated amidst growing apathy or even opposition. And now even first prominent politicians want to reevaluate. I feel like everything goes down south right now... I feel like I fight a futile fight. At least I know that I have some support here...

So yeah... thanks for reading and allowing me to let off steam... Am Israel Chai, hopefully for a long time."

I just wanted to post this question here. Where I‚Äôm from it‚Äôs viewed as pretty much an established fact that Putin had a hand in October 7. First of all that day is Putins birthday and the frequency by which Hamas leadership has visited the Kremlin before and since is obvious. In my view October 7 was done in coordination with Russia and Iran for slightly different reasons. For Putin it‚Äôs a way to split the lefty/progressive/liberal vote especially in the upcoming US elections and to cause a moral panic in the west. Iran on the other hand just wants to kill the Jews and spread the Islamist revolution. Would this view be in any way mainstream amongst Israelis? As a side note I see a lot of Trump support or at least Harris criticism among Israelis, which I find understandable, but at the same time misguided. If Trump wins, Ukraine will be handed to Putin which in turn will be a huge win for Russia of course but tangentially to Iran as well. I‚Äôd like to hear your opinions on the matter!"

1g3zn2w,The burning question for me: Why Isn‚Äôt H a m a s Held Accountable for the daily Gaza‚Äôs Suffering?,2024-10-15 04:28:17,137,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1g3zn2w/the_burning_question_for_me_why_isnt_h_a_m_a_s/,"This is just a question/thought, and feel free to remove it if it goes against the sub's rules.

Every day, I see people on social media blaming Israel, with some pro-pal voices calling Israel all sorts of names. But here‚Äôs my million-dollar question: Why don‚Äôt these people hold Hamas accountable for what they‚Äôve done? Why blame the country that‚Äôs trying to bring its citizens back to safety?

In my opinion, pro-Palestinian advocates should be asking Hamas to release the hostages, which would allow the war to stop, as has been mentioned countless times. So, why do they blame Israel instead of the group holding people captive? Everyone knows Israel won‚Äôt stop until they get their innocent citizens home. If Hamas simply released these people, wouldn‚Äôt that stop further bloodshed on both sides?

I genuinely want to know: why aren‚Äôt people calling out Hamas for their actions in Gaza? Even pro-Pal supporters, if they care about their people and their land, should be pressuring Hamas to return the innocent captives and stop the damage they are upset about.

I‚Äôm asking for knowledge, not to provoke. I support peace."
1g3y6ps,What does the future of Israel look like for left leaning Jews?,2024-10-15 03:05:01,169,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1g3y6ps/what_does_the_future_of_israel_look_like_for_left/,"There has obviously been a shift towards a right leaning society the past 20 years, for two main reasons it seems. One reason is the Palestinian Arabs‚Äô unwillingness to reach a territorial compromise in 2000 followed by the intifada. The continued rejection from arab leaders, including Abbas today, has forced many Israelis to feel as though they have no reasonable partner to negotiate with and they have no choice but to continue the occupation and vote right. This is totally understandable, although the hopelessness of it all makes me sad. 

The other, and probably more significant reason for this significant shift toward the right is demographics. Religious, right wing Jews simply have more children than secular, left-wing Jewish Israelis (5+ children vs 2-3 children). Over the years, there are more and more right wing voters with each successive election. Personally, I feel like Israel‚Äôs shift to a right wing government is permanent and will continue getting more right with each successive election. 

In addition to that, the persistent growth of settlements in the West Bank makes less and less territory for a Palestinian state to emerge. This combined with their continued rejection to the principle of a Jewish state next to them makes me feel like a partition compromise has grown unlikely and will continue growing more and more dead as the decades progress. 

I guess I‚Äôm just worried about the future of Israel and what it means for peace and socially left-leaning people. I‚Äôm worried left-leaning Jews won‚Äôt feel represented in Israel in the future based on the current trajectory. And also I‚Äôm frustrated by there being no end goal or vision from the government for this war and what comes after. 

I was listening to Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg‚Äôs latest interview and she talked about teshuvah. Once you‚Äôve done something wrong you bare the punishment for that act, but the real teshuvah (repair, repentance) is being in the exact same position and doing differently. Making a different choice. 

I look at Israeli society, I look at Jews all across the world, I look at the baseless hatred and division and chaos within Israel and just in general in the world (not specific to us), and we just have to do differently. I don‚Äôt want the next generations to based on hatred and radicalism and hopelessness. It‚Äôs not about guilt, but also what we‚Äôre doing isn‚Äôt working. Regardless of politics, we might be able to agree on that. 

(Anyways, it‚Äôs difficult to tell if this sub is more right or left leaning but these were just some thoughts I had going into Yom Kippur this year. Hope I didn‚Äôt ruffle too many feathers and much love to everyone, regardless of politics). "

1g3uhck,My attemp at understanding Israel Lebanon history since 1967.,2024-10-14 23:55:38,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1g3uhck/my_attemp_at_understanding_israel_lebanon_history/,"I recently watched the documentary ""Lebanon"" in Kan and tried to summarize it as much as I understood and typed it down for others to read and understand this conflict.

I would love you guys to correct me if I made any mistakes.

Israel-Lebanon 1967-2006

**1967 - Lebanon's Limited Role in the Six-Day War**

On June 8, 1967, during the Six-Day War, Lebanon played a minimal role. A Lebanese Hunter jet attempted to engage Israel but was quickly shot down by an Israeli fighter. Lebanon largely stayed out of direct involvement.

**Palestinian Exodus to Jordan and Black September**
After the 1967 war, many Palestinians fled to Jordan, where tensions grew between Palestinian militants and Jordanian forces. In 1970, Palestinians tried to take control of Jordan, leading to clashes with the Jordanian army. They attempted to assassinate King Hussein and hijacked planes, worsening relations.

In **September 1970**, during Black September, Jordan expelled the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). **The Cairo Agreement of 1969** forced Lebanon to accept Palestinian refugees and allowed them to use Lebanon as a base to fight Israel. However, over time, Palestinians began to assert control over parts of Lebanon, further destabilizing the country.

**1970 - The Avivim School Bus Massacre**
On May 22, 1970, Palestinian militants attacked an Israeli school bus near Avivim, killing 12 children and civilians. The attackers were reportedly aided by members of the Japanese Red Army.

**Lebanon's Civil War and Sectarian Violence (1970s)**
The Lebanese Civil War, which began in 1975, saw horrific atrocities committed by all sides:

1) In Damour, Palestinian and leftist militias killed around 500 Lebanese Christians.

2) In Tel al-Zaatar, Christian militias, in turn, killed Palestinians in a siege.

Syria entered the war, initially supporting Palestinian factions against Lebanese Christians. Christians sought help from Israel, which began supplying arms to the Maronite militias, including the Phalange party, led by Bashir Gemayel.

**Brutal Retaliations Between Factions**
After Palestinian forces captured Damour, Christian militias retaliated by evicting Palestinians from parts of Beirut and setting up checkpoints, where they killed Palestinians. Similarly, Palestinian militias committed reprisals against Christians. This mutual violence lasted from 1976-1982.

**Shift in Syrian Support and Begin's Involvement**
By the late 1970s, Syria reduced its support for the Palestinians, shifting its focus to maintaining control over Lebanon. Meanwhile, in 1977, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin began supporting Lebanon's Maronites, although he avoided sending Israeli troops initially.

**1978 - The Coastal Road Massacre and Operation Litani**
In 1978, Palestinian militants infiltrated Israel, killing Gail Rubin, and hijacking a bus on the coastal road to Tel Aviv, killing 35 civilians. This attack triggered Operation Litani, during which Israeli forces invaded southern Lebanon, capturing towns like Maroun al-Ras and Bint Jbeil. The UN soon intervened, leading to a ceasefire and the deployment of UNIFIL forces to monitor the border.

The **Southern Lebanon Army (SLA)** was formed, controlling the area south of the Litani River, supported by Israel. At this time, Lebanon's Shia Muslim population faced significant discrimination and inequality compared to Christians and other Muslims.

**Family Feuds and Sectarian Warfare**
Lebanese politics were highly sectarian. In one incident, Bashir Gemayel ordered the killing of **Tony Frangieh**, his wife, and child. The Frangieh family retaliated by killing one of Gemayel's children. This blood feud underscored the brutality of the civil war.

*""1979 - Samir Kuntar Raid**
In **1979, Samir Kuntar** and other militants crossed into Israel and carried out an attack in Nahariya, killing a police officer and civilians, including 4-year-old **Einat Haran**. This attack intensified Israel's cooperation with Christian militias in Lebanon.

**1981 - Palestinian Rocket Fire and Israeli-Syrian Tensions**
Throughout the early 1980s, Palestinian forces in southern Lebanon continued launching rocket attacks on Israel. At the same time, Christian militias in Lebanon provoked Syria by attacking Syrian patrols in Zahle, hoping to draw Israel further into the conflict. Israel shot down two Syrian helicopters, raising tensions.

**Assassination of Shlomo Argov (1982)**
In 1982, Israeli ambassador Shlomo Argov was shot in London by the Abu Nidal Organization, a breakaway Palestinian faction. This event, along with ongoing rocket fire, triggered Operation Peace for Galilee (also known as the First Lebanon War), where Israel invaded Lebanon. Israeli forces reached Beirut and forced the PLO to evacuate under UN supervision.

**Bashir Gemayel‚Äôs Assassination and the Sabra and Shatila Massacre (1982)**
In 1982, newly elected Lebanese President Bashir Gemayel was assassinated in a bombing, likely orchestrated by Syrian agents. In retaliation, Christian Phalangists entered the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, killing hundreds of Palestinians. Although Israeli forces did not participate, Israel was widely condemned for allowing the massacre to occur.

**US and French Peacekeeping Missions (1983)**
Following international outrage, the US and France sent peacekeeping forces to Lebanon. However, in 1983, a truck bomb attack on US Marine barracks in Beirut killed 241 American servicemen, and a similar attack killed 58 French soldiers. These attacks were carried out by Hezbollah, a new Shia militant group formed with support from Iran, which aimed to turn Lebanon into a Muslim state.

**The Rise of Hezbollah**
Hezbollah was formed from disaffected members of Amal and clerics radicalized by the Iranian Revolution. Iran played a major role in uniting Shia factions in Lebanon. Hezbollah's goal was to drive out Israeli and Western forces and establish a strong Shia presence in Lebanon. Two weeks after the US Marine bombing, another suicide attack targeted Israeli forces in Tyre.

**The Taif Agreement and the End of the Civil War (1989)**
In 1989, the Taif Agreement was signed, which ended Lebanon‚Äôs civil war and disbanded most militias, except Hezbollah, which retained its weapons under the pretext of resisting Israel.

**Israel‚Äôs Withdrawal from Lebanon (2000)**
In 1999, Ehud Barak was elected as Israel's Prime Minister, and by 2000, Israel unilaterally withdrew from southern Lebanon, ending its 18-year presence. The Southern Lebanon Army (SLA) collapsed, and Hezbollah, having achieved its goal of ending Israeli occupation, gained significant political power.

**Assassination of Rafic Hariri (2005)**
In **2005**, former Lebanese Prime Minister **Rafic Hariri** was assassinated, with many blaming Hezbollah and Syrian involvement. Massive protests, known as the **Cedar Revolution**, forced Syrian troops to withdraw from Lebanon after nearly 30 years of occupation.

**2006 - The Second Lebanon War**
In 2006, Hezbollah fighters crossed into Israel, kidnapping two Israeli soldiers, triggering the Second Lebanon War. Despite heavy casualties on both sides, Hezbollah maintained its power in Lebanon, solidifying its role as both a political party and a militant group. "

1g3thn6,Feeling conflicted ,2024-10-14 23:07:52,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1g3thn6/feeling_conflicted/,"Hi all,

For background, I‚Äôm an American Jew‚Äî grew up in reform family, was bar mitzvahed, attended schul for high holidays, and love my Jewish identity..

I‚Äôm been feeling very conflicted recently about Israel, particularly after the moves into Lebanon. I‚Äôm a Zionist. I whole heartedly believe in Israel‚Äôs right to self determination. I have been to Israel before, and cannot wait to go back next year. 

My fear comes from a feeling that Israel‚Äôs response to Iran will cause a full blown war. Not only does this make me worried about Israel‚Äôs safety and the potential loss of life, but also makes me worry that Israel will lose lots of favorability among law makers and the general public ‚Äî ultimately leading to even more antisemitism. 

I understand that favorability is not the only thing that matters, and I understand why Israel feels the need to retaliate. 

Sometimes I just think if Israel was able to mostly ‚Äúthwart‚Äù Irans attack, they should take the high road and focus elsewhere. I just don‚Äôt think Israel could ever remove the terroristic threat of Iran, even with a full scale war‚Ä¶ maybe I‚Äôm wrong..? Maybe  I‚Äôm a pessimist..?

I am not the most researched person, and I recognize that. I dont want to sound like a bed-wetter or snowflake etc. I am just curious:

Has anyone else been feeling like this? 

How are you dealing with these feelings?

Do you worry about the potential for an extreme rise in antisemitism if a full blown war broke out?

Any or thoughts?

Thank you very much :) Am Yisrael Chai

In it, he has described giving Palestinians who give up nationalist aspirations and pledge loyalty to Israel, **residential rights which I am interpreting as permanent residence**. He says that for those that won't pledge loyalty to Israel, they will be given compensation to emigrate. And for those that don't pledge loyalty, nor emigrate, they will be ""defeated"". 

Putting aside the emigration and the ""defeat"" (whatever that means), how would residential rights for west bank Palestinians work? In the case of annexation of WB (a forgone conclusion since the right wing in Israel does get everything), I am guessing a significant number of Palestinians will begrudgingly accept residency, in the face of no alternatives. Would this residency status be the same as the status given to East Jerusalem Arabs after 1967 when they refused to accept Israeli citizenship? Given that there are approximately 2.5-2.7 million Palestinians in the WB, even a partial acceptance by the WB Palestinians (lets say even 1 million) will change Israel rapidly. 

If the status being considered for the WB Palestinians after the annexation is similar to that of the East Jerusalem Arabs, i.e. permanent residence (sans the ability to apply for citizenship), how does that not fundamentally transform Israel and bring it closer to a single state! If these new residents can live, work, study, start businesses, buy and rent property anywhere in Israel, (as the permanent residents of Israel can!) then does it not sort of negate the idea of Zionism?

Given all TV and radio stations are government owned and controlled, that is on every channel, a few times a day, every day, year in, year out. The content doesn't matter. It doesn't even have to be true or make sense. Things like: A Palestinian family of twelve was killed in Israeli airstrikes on an empty barn. Zionist settlers set Palestinian kittens on fire in occupied West Bank. Some bullet hit a man walking in Gaza, we assume it was the Zionists. 

Then there are other forms of government-funded propaganda. There was a TV series a few years ago, with a big budget and everything, about a ""Zionist"" rich man who kidnapped an innocent Palestinian child, STOLE HER EYES, and sort of installed them on his own formerly blind son. It was called ""Zahra's Blue Eyes"" if you want to look it up. I thought Zahra having blue eyes made her suspect of being a European coloniser herself, but they know Iranians like blue eyes. 

There are also murals by government on city walls depicting an Israeli tank (whoch looks nothing like the Merkava, but what do they know) aiming at a kid or a butterfly or something. Not to mention the vast amounts of money spent on youtube channels, online groups, Instagram, videogames, thinktanks, etc. But thankfully most of that money is embezzled by themselves so little comes out of those ventures. 

I have still left a lot unmentioned. It is TOO MUCH for one post. Schools, university, business organisations, public transport, everything is tainted by anti-Israel propaganda. 

So if you happen to see an Iranian that espouses some anti-israel bias, that is not surprising. Talk to them on a human level. The image the regime has created of Israelis is such a caricature that often meeting a real person from Israel is enough to make someone question everything they have been told. 

What IS surprising though, and very encouraging, is the huge number of Iranians I see who support Israel. That is despite the peopaganda and brain-washing they have been subjected to since, literally, birth. It gives me heart to see so many people have attempted to discover the truth on their own. 

Despite the horrors and the difficulties we face today, both in Iran and over there in Israel, I believe the future will be bright. All the best, and stay safe."

One of the themes you see recurring in the online discourse is the notion that Israel is now tainted; Young people around the Western world hate us, people will stop buying Israeli tech, investments will dry up, people see Israel as a rogue state etc...you know the drill.

However, I think one of the things to come out of this horrific year is the renewed interest globally in this region. The few hardcore BDS idiots aside, more than anything, people are now invested in the story. Once the dust clears, and Israel emerges victorious in some shape or form (as seems to be the case), many people will be interested in coming to see Israel first person. Many people will be interested in Israeli innovation, history, tech, and Jewish culture. This also applies of course to world Jewry, who have developed a much stronger connection to Israel over the last year.

At the end of the day, Israel is easily accessible, unlike other conflict torn parts of the world. I think we will see much larger numbers of tourists than before. If you think this is far-fetched, you can check into the large numbers of people visiting Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. And that's Afghanistan.

If you are in the tourist industry, don't despair. I think we are going to see the upside of this soon."

1g30ozc,How should I fix this/ Lawyer Rec,2024-10-13 21:45:41,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1g30ozc/how_should_i_fix_this_lawyer_rec/,"Seeking some advice for my probably not unique situation. Feel free to DM any recs instead of posting, thanks in advance! 

Background: 
Jewish Father born in USSR, immigrated to Israel in 1973, onward immigrated to the US in the 1980s

Father married my (Jewish from USSR) mother in 1990s in the US. I was born, then shortly thereafter they divorced. 

My birth was never properly registered with the Israeli consulate. I never lived in Israel, only took short trips to visit family. I am 32 years old.

In 2013, I visited Israel, and entered on my US passport with tourist Visa. I was in the country for ~3mo. I took a weekend trip to Jordan, and upon returning to the Israeli land border, was questioned about how I spoke Hebrew. Due to my idiocy, I mentioned my dad was Israeli. This immediately raised issues with the border guard who said my status was uncertain, gave me a two week visa and told me to visit the interior ministry. The ministry told me that I was an Israeli citizen by birth and I had to register for IDF etc. I was able to hire a lawyer who went with me, and was allowed to leave the country on my US passport, however I‚Äôm almost certain I‚Äôm unable to return without getting my citizenship straightened out. I‚Äôve attempted to fix this a couple of times, but every time I get the runaround at the consulate, and they tell me that I need an extremely extensive list of documents proving my parents marriage from 30 years ago was bona fida (joint bank accounts etc). My parents are less than helpful, and I‚Äôm pretty sure none of the documents exist anymore. 

Is there anything I can do under the law of return or anything else that can straighten out my status without having to find a bunch of documents that no longer exist? Are there any legal firms that specialize in this kind of a case? 

Thank you!!

The whole world is waiting with baited breath to see what Israel will do and then how Iran will respond.

Why hasn't anyone been discussing cyber attacks as a valid option?

In my imagination, this would be a first step to lay the groundwork for something more massive and impactful. But I'm just speculating! I'm barely even an armchair strategist. 

I just find it odd that even on Israeli news, they're focusing a lot on conventional aerial attacks, showing maps, highlighting the pros and cons, the American perspective, etc. and meanwhile, Israel has demonstrated recently that it has a very diverse toolbox. "

It‚Äôs tough to see protests against you, but those people don‚Äôt understand the depth of the problem. You‚Äôre just trying to protect yourselves, don‚Äôt feel guilty about that.

People often ask me what it‚Äôs like in Lebanon. Well I‚Äôm not there right now, but my family in Batroun says it‚Äôs the same old story. They‚Äôre trying to stay positive, but they feel scared, especially with the recent influx of refugees. Just yesterday, there was an Israeli strike near Batroun, which really worried me. It targeted a Hezbollah depot, but it‚Äôs alarming to see a Christian area hit. This is why I bought my parents tickets today for Cyprus. Many of us believe that Hezbollah was stashing those weapons to kill us since we are so ‚Äúdisobedient‚Äù to their ways.

Politically, Lebanon is still stuck in deadlock with no president in sight. As for why Lebanese people don‚Äôt stand up to Hezbollah, many are simply tired and feel helpless after the October 17, 2019 revolution that Hezbollah terrorized. Right now, they‚Äôre scared and focused on survival, most actually hate Hezbollah and blame them for starting this war. Yes, some blame you too, not every anti-Hezbollah is your friend, but that‚Äôs not the priority right now. The focus should be on dealing with Hezbollah/Iran first and then figure out how to unite and bring people together later.

Stay positive and have faith that after this ends, the Middle East will be a better place. Also, this time, I hope Israel doesn‚Äôt leave Lebanon until it makes absolutely sure that Lebanon of the 50s and the 60s is back. "
1g2ll20,"Talking about morality and the emergence of Israel as a state, and the Nakba.",2024-10-13 09:03:55,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1g2ll20/talking_about_morality_and_the_emergence_of/,"Boker tov, my fellow Israelis! As a prelude, allow me to say, that this is intended as a challenging conversation, but not as a ""call out"" or an attempt at blaming anyone, or condemning Israelis and Israel of today for what happened 70+ years ago. I'm a pro-Israel Russian/Ukrainian-Israeli who arrived in the country about 2 years ago. I would describe my views as center-left, and liberal. Let's begin.   
  
After reading Benny Morris's book ""The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited"", specifically, Chapter 2 ""The idea of ‚Äòtransfer‚Äô in Zionist thinking before 1948"", I have been faced with a lot of questions of moral character, and spent some time thinking about what Ive read there, and after. For those of you who have never read it, I highly recommend you do so, Benny is one of the most if not *the* most respected historians in Israel and offers a very balanced and informed approach to our history. I'll give a short (as short as possible) overview of what the Zionist movement thought about transferring Arabs from the land of Palestine throughout the years.   

* **The end of the 19th century** and the beginning of Zionism, mainly in Theodor Herzl. The idea of transfer is rarely mentioned openly but talked about privately. This is a trend that continued all throughout the pre-1948 period, although it had slightly different reasons behind it. A few main ones remained, open talk about the transfer was thought to alienate those who were potential allies to Zionism, as well as put tension on the Arabs, who would perceive such discussion as making plans to expel them. Notably, transfer as an idea, while still in its infancy, was a real moral quandary for early Zionist leaders. Despite population transfers being considered moral, just, and rational in the time period, the idea did not sit well in the minds of Zionists, who were at the time majorly liberals and socialists. If talked about, it was always in the context of voluntary, or at the very least compensated transfer, where the Jews would buy land for the Arabs, or pay them some other way. 
* **The beginning of the 20th century** was characterized by shifts in this thinking. While many attempts to begin the voluntary transfer took place, none of them were substantial. Many of Zionist leaders preferred to still not to talk about the transfer, as more pressing matters were at hand, and one could always hope that a simple purchase of land and the following resettling of local Arabs would be satisfactory for the goals of the movement. However, spurs of Arab violence brought up the conversation, each time with more of the movement being ok with the idea of ""forceful"" transfer. 
* **1930s-1948** were, as we all know, the moment everything went down the proverbial drain. Arab violence, sporadic British limitations on Jewish immigration, and the emerging, and later raging Holocaust put Zionist leaders in a desperate position. Without many options left, and the plight of Jewish people as relevant as it ever was, or will be, the idea of forceful transfer and its necessity was all but accepted by the majority of the Jewish people in Palestine and abroad. Notably, the British and even the Arab leaders agreed with the notion (just as before, although before they agreed with an idea of voluntary transfer), that population movements were crucial for any state, be it a Jewish, or Arab one, to survive. During the civil war between the Yeshuv and the Palestinian Arabs in 1947, and the War of Independence in 1948, about 700 thousand Palestinian Arabs fled the territory that would become Israel. Some did it from sheer panic and fear of war, some were expelled by the Hagana and later IDF, who believed it impossible to establish a state with a large amount of disloyal populace, and some fled at the request of Arab leaders, who invaded in hopes of grabbing territory and, if possible, stopping the emergence of Israel. 

So, knowing this history (and feel free to point out any critical mistakes I made if you find them) my questions to the sub, are this (I'll add my own answers in parentheses):

1. Do you think there was, either pre or during 1947-1948, a policy (meaning a top-down, government-pushed objective) of expulsion directed at Palestinian Arabs? *(Personally, I do not see any evidence of that. Although the idea was considered inevitable, and even necessary, no such policy existed to my knowledge.)* 
2. Do you think the idea of transfer was moral for the Zionist movement to consider? Would it be more moral, or just, or practical, to follow the more left-leaning circles of the movement, and attempt to build a bi-national single state? *(I think people of the past should be judged with the standards of the historical period taken into account. Even though today the idea of forceful transfer of populations sounds incredibly inhumane and cruel to me, it was different back then, with examples like Greek-Turkish transfers improving relations and conditions of the people. Considering also that this question was a moral dilemma for early Zionism, and peaceful variations were preferred up to a point of no return, I would consider the idea morally grey, and relatively just. With how things usually go down in history, Zionist aspirations were more virtuous than almost anyone at the time. The idea of a bi-national state seems to be as an unworkable one at the time.)* 
3. Do you think the expulsion that took place during 1947-1948 was too violent, or was it simply a ""necessary evil"" during wartime? *(This is hard for me. Reading about the way the Hagana, and later IDF cleared out Arab villages is unsettling. While acts of real, sadistic cruelty are very rare and hard to find,  hundreds of thousands of people fleeing from war and terror, without many desiring to protect them, and even the peaceful Arabs faced with the reality, that the Jewish state cannot accept a large number of Arabs inside its borders, are all horrific to think about. It was a necessary evil for the creation of Israel, and considering the Holocaust, I cannot blame Jews for doing everything in their power to create a safe haven for their people.)*
4. Would you say, that Arab resistance to this expulsion, mainly during the civil war, is justified? Do you sympathize with the plight of people displaced from territories they considered their home, irrespective of how violently they attempted to curb the process? *(Even though their methods and motivations were questionable at best, with terrorism and pogroms being commonplace, it's hard for me to claim objectivity and say that only one side in a civil war for the creation of a state is justified. Arab Palestinians fighting in a civil war against the Yeshuv were motivated by similar feelings of a desire for a state, although to a much lesser extent compared to Jews. And so, I would say, that both sides during that time had understandable justifications for what they did. I sympathize with people being displaced, as any person familiar with Jewish history should, even if those people are enemies of the Israeli state.)*
5. Are you willing to concede, that Jewish terrorism played a major role in the establishment of Israel, whether you think of the British being targeted after imposing immigration restrictions, Arabs being targeted by Jewish militias pre-1948 during one of the many clashes between the two communities, or Arabs being targeted during the civil war in attempts to push them out of Palestine?  *(Yes, I think Jewish terrorism, while not the defining part of the movement or the military tactics it employed during 1947-1948, played its role in the creation of Israel, and it's important to not forget, or deny, this bloody and complicated history.)*

I understand this post might be too long and/or heavy for people to engage with, but I'm interested in hearing your answers, thoughts, and discussion anyway. Looking back into history can give us more understanding of the present, and I hope all engagement (if any will happen lol) will be in good faith. "

In some Romance languages like French for example they now include the feminine term after the masculine or vice versa. For example, le professeur (first one is the masculine professor second one after the dot is the feminine one. I don‚Äôt think this would make sense in Hebrew but I‚Äôm not sure. 

I don‚Äôt mean to offend anyone with this question or provoke controversy. I was just curious what Israelis think about this. Personally I would use gender neutral language if it made someone more comfortable. "

After getting to know a few of you through *mifgash*, I had a couple questions about the Israeli experience with Taglit:

1. What's the process for applying to join a trip? Is it very competitive? What criteria do they use to select participants? Do you get to express your preference for a particular group (e.g., Israel Outdoors, Mayanot)?
2. Are all participants active-duty IDF? Or can you still join the program after being discharged?
3. Do Israelis selected for the *mifgash* represent a general cross-section of Israeli society? If not, what perspectives did I likely not hear?
4. How do Israelis in general perceive Taglit? Are there any stereotypes (true or untrue) that persist?
5. For those of you who participated in a *mifgash*, what was your experience like?
6. What questions *should* I have asked the Israelis on my trip, but probably didn't?
7. When I come back to visit, where should I go that I probably didn't get to see my first time around?

For context, we had seven Israelis on my trip and just under 20 Americans. The Israelis were all hilonim between 21 and 25, with a fairly even gender split, and most were officers.

I hope you all had a meaningful holiday, and that those of you who fasted had an easy one. Toda!"

Do I believe the UN has a bias against Israel? Certainly. Do I believe there is a media bias against Israel? I do. Do I think UNIFIL peacekeepers should have gotten out of the way when the IDF requested they do so? Yes.

All that said, once the news first emerged, I remember some saying that a few stray bullets weren't that big of a deal. Some of us tried to say we should allow for more information to emerge. 

This wasn't stray bullets. It was tank fire. One photo online purports to be of the tower that was struck, but I can't confirm it is legitimate, so I don't want to risk spreading false news. I find it hard to believe I cannot find any news outlets reporting the picture and only a handful of users on social media websites sharing it. If it is real, it looks bad for Israel.

The IDF says it was responding to an immediate threat, but what would that threat be? There is a lot on the ground we can't know, but that means it is Israel's responsibility to justify what it did. Global opinion matters and will negatively affect Israel for a long time to come if Israel doesn't explain. Israel is not fighting a war on seven fronts. It is a war on eight fronts, and the eighth front is public opinion.

Modern medicine treats cancer fairly aggressively. It cuts out tumors and kills cells with chemo and radiation. The idea seems to be to kill the cancer faster than the patient because when the cancer is gone, the treatments will stop, but if the treatment stops before the cancer is dead, the cancer will kill the patient. 

It is kind and compassionate and good to want to help someone suffering from cancer treatment, but you do that by supporting the body, not by stopping the treatments. 

In Gaza, in Lebanon, there are civilian casualties. It's terrible that they suffer for the crimes of others, but leaving the cancer to fester won't save them. And in this case, it's contagious, so it definitely won't save others. "

Here's a list:

* [Operation Summer Rains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Summer_Rains) (2006)
* [Operation Cast Lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_(2008%E2%80%9309)) (2008‚Äì2009)

* [Operation Guardian of the Walls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Guardian_of_the_Walls) (2021)
* And the current ongoing war.

What do all six have in common? **They began during a period when a cease-fire was in effect, and Hamas violated that cease-fire**.  (Many times Hamas continued to shoot rockets at Israel *during* cease-fires, but Israel didn't go to war over those violations.)

Hamas views every ceasefire as an opportunity to re-arm itself and prepare for their next cease-fire violation.

It's stupid for Israel to agree to another cease-fire (unless it's temporary and short, like the one that happened around the hostage release).

No other country would say, ""Okay, sure they started six wars while we had a cease-fire in place, but surely they'll honor the seventh cease-fire, right?""

Anything less than the total defeat of Hamas will simply lead to another Hamas-started war.

Ideally Hamas will surrender, but if not, killing every single Hamas member (including non-combatants) is the only path I see to Israeli safety from future Hamas attacks."

Another advantage is that the party in government has full power to implement what it wants, and cant wiggle out by blaming it's coalition partners (as much as PR) , and it is easy to lose power because what matters aren't your core voters, but the swing voters (who are centrist by definition) who will determine your fate.

It described an Arab Israeli world that is very distant from the Jewish one. He portrayed the Arabs he met as likable but backward in so many different ways, corrupt, without intellectual curiosity or critical thinking. In his telling, they have a penchant for simply inventing history if it doesn't fit into a narrative that they want to believe.  As an American, I was surprised at how little integrated the two societies are in his account.

Hello guys! Quick question about international law and defensive wars. I‚Äôve been thinking about the legal aspects of countries acquiring territory during a defensive war. For example, when a country like Israel defends itself against an attack and ends up controlling additional territory, is it legally allowed to retain that land for security reasons?

I know the UN Charter (Article 51) allows for self-defense, but it doesn‚Äôt explicitly address whether territories gained in defensive wars can be kept. Also, UN Security Council Resolution 242 (1967) mentions the ‚Äòinadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war,‚Äô but it talks about ‚Äòsecure and recognized boundaries,‚Äô which seems a bit open to interpretation. It also talks about Israel having the right to exist and people talk about how ambigious this was left to be because it omitted ‚Äúthe territories‚Äù it never said to give away all territories so I‚Äôm confused about what they were talking about  and I know there was the green line made in the 1949 which i‚Äôll mention below

the 1949 Draft Declaration on Rights and Duties of States emphasized not recognizing territorial gains from aggressive wars but defensive wars was left to interpretation but this was adopted just after the 1948‚Äì1949 Arab-Israeli War when Israel expanded its territory beyond the 1947 partition (I recognize that technically neither Israel nor Palestine were sovereign states in 1947 and so it makes the issue more complicated, Palestine never claimed independence while Israel did in 1948 so it‚Äôs again more complicated) . So, I‚Äôm curious‚Äîdoes international law make a distinction between land gained in defensive wars versus offensive wars?

Can you tell me why?  I was surprised - if you are Jewish, why not just register as Jewish.  And I often see news about Soviet Jews who want to register as Jewish but can't, so I thought it was something many people wanted to do.



Some reasons I thought of: the person who told me was secular, so maybe she doesn't care as much; maybe it's something only the religious do, and it's like saying you're super religious; it gives the Rabbinate more control over some parts of your life.  But I don't know if that's true.



Your help in understanding is appreciated!"

Most Hamas apologists (I'm being polite in my terminology here) have the, in my view simplistic, belief that in 1948, a group of Zionists, with the help of the Western world, just conquered the land that is now Israel by force, kicked out the Palestinians, and started suppressing Palestinians from that moment on. And the story is that that is why the Palestinians are mad now, so that excuses all their behavior since then, including the recent attacks. 

I remember reading a lot about this history, and finding out that it wasn't like that (for instance, most of the land had been bought, not annexed), but that was a long time ago. I would like to have some reliable sources that describe the history of the creation of Israel in a way that is more objective, and incorporates both perspectives, so I can counter that simplistic narrative. Can you help me find these? I found a podcast by Ezra Klein that is interesting, but that only describes the background of the two intifadas, not the earlier history. Thanks in advance!"
1g0nra5,"Israel is bucking the wider developed world trend in maintaining fertility rates amongst women. What makes Israeli society more family-friendly, and what can other countries learn from this?",2024-10-10 17:08:11,188,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1g0nra5/israel_is_bucking_the_wider_developed_world_trend/,"I posted this originally in a UK thread lamenting our decreasing birth rate. Coincidentally I was looking at population pyramids the other day, and noted Israel had one of the most stable, balanced distribution graphs. The population is growing, but slowly rather than exponentially, and all major population groups are above replacement rate.

Charedim are their own phenomenon, so I put them slightly aside from the main analysis, but for the sake of completion their fertility rate is around 6.

Amongst Jews, all non Charedi sectors - the 85% - are having good numbers of children:

Dati Leumi - 4.3
Masorti - 3
Hiloni - 2.1 

Which makes for an average of 2.4 per woman.

Amongst Arab Israelis it's 2.2, which is right in the same ballpark. 

Only Christians (1.7) and Druze (1.8), who combined make up under 10% of the population, are below replacement rate.

Israel is a modern, developed nation with gender equality, state healthcare and access to contraception, alongside a population that is more secular than many people realise - about half of Jewish Israelis consider themselves Hiloni.

So the nation is doing something right in how society supports families, and encourages people to have sufficient children (by choice) to support the older people. 

It's worth noting this phenomenon persists despite ongoing conflict and instability that, in many other places, lead people to *not* want to have children. Additionally the country is relatively small, and land isn't cheap, but many people are happy to have bigger families anyway.

With the approaching 'population crisis' in many other countries, Israel stands out as not experiencing that same level of decline - and it is not limited to Jews, or to the most religious, but is a general phenomenon. 

So I'm curious: for those with more first-hand experience of Israeli Culture and Lifestyle, what do you think the country is doing right here that the rest of the world could learn from?

I loved your responses from before and wanted to venture out into the wild (the internet I just love being dramatic) and thought I should look at pro Israel activists. I've noticed major platforms giving me the opposite articles and videos. I've always heard that the media brainwashed Americans to be pro Israel but almost every news outlet was pro Palestine. Except fox news but imo it hurts any cause with its fake news. 

I find it interesting that I am seeing dozens of anti zionists online. I already know that the government is corrupt (my sympathies for that) and I already know a country with mandatory service will have young people who are traumatized and radicalized. But some content creators amd journalists will use every clip and generalize ""see that's how Israelis dehumanize Palestinians"". Ok but what about the things Palestinians say to dehumanize Israelis? Rafio silence. Logically these things are fed to both sides to make each side feel justified to fight because the war machine is very profitable especially for politicians with zero regard to human life. 

I need to ask, did this shift in media happen after last year's attack? Or was it always a lie that the west media pushed zionist agenda?

Also in one video of a man (I think British from his accent) he showed clips of a podcast called 2 nice jewish boys. Obviously I started watching them after. I don't know anything about them but you can clearly see they're traumatized and hurt and hate Palestinians because of the attack. Even if they were fed anti Palestine information since they were kids, that attack gave them every reason to act this way. In my opinion there is still so much misinformation on every side. But they're just people who are hurt and angry. It's ridiculous to generalize. Even more ridiculous to judge this reaction after a deadly attack.

What are your thoughts on this? 

Also can you please recommend English speaking pro Israel content? Thanks in advance."

Before we start:

* Yes. I do despise Hamas, Hezbollah, and the theological Iranian regime. I consider all of them to be terrorist groups/regimes. I do despise every single theological regime in the region. 
* Yes. I believe that the jews deserve their own state. Historical Israel.
* No, I don't want to eradicate Israel. 
* Yes, October 7th was a terrorist attack. 
* Yes, I realize that my position and view are very rare in the Arab world.

I have other beliefs but that's for another day.

Since I can't understand or read hebrew, I have found it difficult to understand YOUR perspective and opinion on several matters. Obviously, almost every single  Arabic-speaking news outlet treats Israel (at least the Israeli government) as the absolute evil, so I get nothing from there either. However, I want to have an open and reasonable dialogue with you. No gotchas. Let's talk.

For the following questions, take a deep breath, think long-term, and try to answer the following. 

**Question 1:**  Where do you think the borders of the state of Israel? is it the borders of June 4th, 1967? from the river to the sea? from the euphrates to the nile? 

**Question 2:** Do you think there's such a thing as ""Palestenians""? Do you believe they have a right to a state?

**Question 3:** What do you think of the current government? especially people like Itamar Ben-Gvir and Smotritch? Do you consider them to be radicalists and extremists? If not, provide reasons.

**Question 4:** Israel possesses the most technologically advanced and precise millitary in the region, with one of the strongest intelligence agencies on the planet. In the matter of 10 days, they absolutely demolished Hezbollah's command and control chain.  Some consider that the biggest intelligence breach in modern warfare. In light of those facts, do you believe that the Israeli government is actually unable to get to the hostages in Gaza and Hamas's leaders? 

  
I have many more questions to ask, but the post would be thousands of words long. 

Thank You."

Hey yall. Im a 30 year old non-Jew. Did a lot of Israel advocacy in college and some of my closest friends in life are Jewish or Israeli. Since last year, I decided to cut off people from my life whose moral compass degenerated to a point where they took the pro-terrorist narrative. Being vocal about my views, I kind of gotten blocked and alienated from many of my woke Chicago friends. I have some close friends in my life for whom Im grateful but they are not really invested in global affairs which is kinda relieving. However, Im curious if there are any people who share my views on the topics of Israel, Pro-Western values and objective morality. I dont care for your age, gender or background. Just hoping to expand my circle to include some more people i actually actively align with on these fundamental issues. 

I also spend a lot of time in Austin, El Paso, TX and NYC, LA and sometimes Miami. If anyone wants to just connect on Insta that works too. 

Thinking of all of my Jewish brothers and sisters who feel alienated and exhausted in the world that seems increasingly confused and hostile. You are not alone. This Goy has your back.

1) Do the 'Elite' (financial, political) of Israel send their kids to state or Private schools?

2) Do people want to live in 'good catchment areas' for primary and/or secondary schools? Ie are schools in some areas considered a lot better than others? 

3) Finally, i remember reading that Israel didn't have many private schools, but it had 'state subsidised schools', where people pay some fees but the rest is paid by the State. Is this true? 

Many thanks"
1fzlhd0,Someone please explain the hate against Netanyahu regarding the war since October 7th,2024-10-09 06:57:01,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1fzlhd0/someone_please_explain_the_hate_against_netanyahu/,"I see and hear people talking about that the conduct of this war is bad, that the Palestinian and Lebanese civilians suffer more than necessary through war acts conducted by the IDF, that Netanyahu prevented a hostage deal without good reasons and more generally a ceasefire which would supposedly allow talks for peace and a two-state solution (which might even be not such a great idea at the moment?).

And I feel like that much of what I hear is either not made concrete - where I think ‚ÄûOkay, you hate Netanyahu.. but why? Please elaborate!‚Äú - or what people say is not very nuanced and actually needs a lot more context. Because the war effort is quite complicated to understand, there is quite a lot at stake for Israel and questions regarding morale, humanity and safety don‚Äôt really have an easy answer (especially in context of this war).

So in conclusion: I don‚Äôt think that they‚Äôre isn‚Äôt stuff to criticize about how Netanyahu and the current government conduct this war, but most people around me (in Germany) don‚Äôt do it properly. So what I wanna know is what are the criticisms from liberal and left-leaning people who generally support Israel about this war? And do these make sense?"

I decided to tune out of the Middle-East because of the non-stop incidents of violence.

I saw the video of the naked Israeli woman's body being desecrated as it was paraded in the streets. This was absolutely appalling and gross.

Then, I read about a woman getting beaten up with the handle of a gun. Why, what for?

Israelis being held in caves for months and the barbaric malnutrition as well as mistreatment of Israelis.

The people who support Hamas are the same people that think life is cheap and if you suicide bomb yourself, you're a hero and here is a cheque for 25 k or etc.

You can't have peace with bad faith actors like this.

Where some cheer at the deaths of IDF soldiers or Israelis dying, Israelis debate the appropriate course of action to minimize deaths.

The mindset is toxic and it is ingrained in the minds of Palestinian youth.

Pro-Palestinian protests end up in vandalism and violence. You can hear them chanting slogans for Hamas and from the River to the Sea.

Hamas murders its own people and intimidates/terrorizes them.

If they didn't toss stones at Israelis, renounced violence, the members of the Likud would reimagine the peace process.

It is shocking that they would murder youngsters at a Rave where people attended to celebrate life.

Netennutella was right about a vision of collaboration in the Middle-East being the great alternative.

But Hamas and Hezbollah as well as its proxy supporters need to be dismantled.

These sickening calls to genocide Israelis and these deranged celebrations wishing death on Israel needs to go.

There needs to be a paradigm shift. 

There needs to be a firm resolve for significant change.

My sincere condolences to the family members lost on October 7th for the Israelis who were affected. May their souls know peace and G-d bless them.

The events that transpired on that day shocks the conscience."

I know it is unlikely and useless to think about but here is what I outlined in my head to put on the leaflet, just because I already sketched it out... and... well.... maybe something like this: 

We, the government and military of Isreal, do not want war with Iran. We, the people of Israel, respect the ancient and noble Persian civilization and believe the Iranian people form a great nation. In culture, commerce, science, and all the noble pursuits of humanity, Iran should be a leader among nations.¬†

However, the millionaire mullahs and their foolish fanatic followers have squandered your national wealth. Instead of building up Iran for the Iranian people, the Islamic Republic of Iran has funded terrorists to attack and kill us in Israel. The autocratic government of the Islamic Republic has spent your money to turn us, Israel and the Jewish people, from friends to enemies. This waste of treasure and life has achieved nothing other than to bring war to Iran, a war that the Islamic Republic cannot win.¬†

Israel and Iran have no reason to be at war. There is no territory in dispute between our nations. In fact, as ancient peoples of the region, Iran and Israel should be natural allies. We should be engaged in trade, cultural exchange, and working together to bring stability and peace to the region. There is no issue or conflict between our nations. We don‚Äôt even share a common border.¬†

The millionaire Mullahs have wasted your national wealth on terrorists in Gaza and Lebanon. There is nothing these terrorists can do that would help the people of Iran in any way. The fanatics that run Iran have fired missiles into Israel to kill our people indiscriminately. There is no benefit to anyone in Iran. And there is no possible benefit to the people of Israel or Palestine. There is no way to conceive of a lasting peace in the region when there are powerful terrorist armies running amok everywhere.¬†What kind of vision is that? Terrorists here, enemies there. Enough of that. 

Although we have nothing but respect for the people of Iran and the many cultures in your ancient land, we will bring war. You have seen the wars in Gaza and Lebanon started by the terrorist armies of the Islamic Republic. We do not want to see the same in Iran.¬†

While squandering the national wealth on war and terrorism, the same tyrants have repressed the people of Iran. In the past, the Iranian people have risen up against the idiotic regime ruling a great nation. As we make war on the government of the Islamic Republic, we will do everything we can to minimize civilian casualties. We will support any and all forces rising up against the fools who have led your great country into war, whether on the edges of the country in minority areas or in the center and in the cities, led by those fed up with the failures of this regime.¬†

If there were a way to bring this evil regime down, war could be yet avoided. Our only demand is that we live in peace, without terrorists attacking us or missiles raining down on us. Any government in Iran that plays no role in terrorism or missile strikes on us, could be our friend.¬†

There is no reason for this war other than the stupidity and extremism of the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran led by rich, ignorant, fanatics. We want to live in peace without terrorists or missiles. That's our only goal. We know the people of Iran agree and want the same. Take the mullahs of the Islamic Republic out of the equation, and peace wins.

1fz9zk3,Can anyone explain this IDF patch?,2024-10-08 20:39:08,36,https://i.redd.it/i6j3ynlwfltd1.jpeg,"Apparently this is going around some parts of social media so that people can claim Israel wants to take over everything, blah blah, Protocols of the Elders of Zion, blah blah blah. 

My personal theory was that it's real and it's an old patch design from the 1970s. However, now that I'm saying that, I realize I have no idea what areas this map really covers... Just looked and nope, it's definitely the Nile to the Euphrates, but with a very hard line cutting across the bottom of the Arabian peninsula? Artistic license there, maybe?

The motto next to it apparently says, ""The land of Israel is safe."" So now my guesses are:

1. It's photoshopped
2. It's a badge you can get elsewhere 
3. It's a real IDF badge that uses the Biblical territory of Israel to represent the People Of Israel, rather than meaning ""we wanna expand and take all of this land over!""

1fz8yy4,"to the brave people of Israel, from Poland ",2024-10-08 19:55:59,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1fz8yy4/to_the_brave_people_of_israel_from_poland/,"hi from Poland! yesterday, we marked the anniversary of a painful moment in modern history, and I want you all to know that my thoughts are with you; it's been a year, but honestly it's been like forever - I don't want to imagine how difficult it is for the families of the victims who were murdered in such brutal ways that it's unbelievable how cruel a human might be and how sick our world has become over 

700 brave Israeli men and women have died not only for their land, but also for people around them, protecting their fellow Israelis from those beasts that people somehow have audacity to call ""freedom fighters"", and let's not forget that Israel, no matter what people in every corner of the world want to believe in, is defending all of us from those terrorists

the past twelve months have also been a form of test for people in other countries, sadly we only received a huge disappointment; I can't tell for all people here, but for sure, the 7th of October changed something in Polish society, for worse, but also for the better - young people are very much indoctrinated to believe that Israel is at fault and Palestine is innocent, all ""thanks"" to TikTok and other propaganda-infected apps, HOWEVER, the number of pro-Israel people is increasing day by day, seeing what Israel has been doing - I'm talking here about people who are not as easy to manipulate and have their own opinion, you cannot even imagine how happy I am to see such comments, especially online - from time to time, I like reading Polish press online, but more specifically comments under articles about Israel, and I'm super proud of the amount of people openly expressing their support for Israel, actually defending it, sharing facts, and standing up for the truth; I'm honestly glad that people are finally smart enough to see that Israel has every right to defend itself, our government also seems to be normal in this case, along with the president, so there's always hope, and I wish both of our countries good relations in the future, that's what we need more than ever!

G-d is with you, may He always has you in His loving arms; I'm sending the best wishes and hugs to all Israelis, Jews all around the world who are reading it, pouring love from Poland - the truth is still the truth, even if no one believes it "

Israel killed about 45,000 people in 1 year. Presumably close to 20,000 of them active combatants.

Hamas killed 1200 people in about 5-6 hours. If Israel did not do anything it's not like they would have stopped. Hamas' (and Hezbollah's) stated goal is to kill everyone in Israel. 

If Hamas was able to run amock without any Israeli defense, in 10 days they would have killed over 40,000 people. And as we know, over 2/3 civilians (and the other third consistent of many off duty soldiers).

People who support Hamas because Israel is ""committing genocide"" are genocide supporters, they're just upset their side got thwarted.

I talked to the people and they share the same views that the war should end and Hamas is the true villain. But it's sad to know that the pro Palestine people of my school (and unfortunately my own friends) turn a blind eye to those who suffer in Israel. I also saw a instagram story of a friend saying this marks the year anniversary of ""Israel attacking Palestine for its land and plan to kill all Palestines"". A little ironic they don't care about those who die from Israel but post daily when someone from Palestine dies. But that's just me venting that my school is stuck in an endless echo chamber listening to a single news source and shoving their heads in the sand whenever someone has information that disagrees with what they think."
1fz58nf,7/10 in Prague and a little rant,2024-10-08 17:19:55,1355,https://i.redd.it/4j1jflg9gktd1.jpeg,"I attended the 7/10 memorial in Prague last night and I heard a lot of hebrew amongst Czech.

It was a weird day in general. I'm not Jewish, maybe couple generations ago, given the history of the Czech Republic, but all of this has been hitting quite close to home for me. And I'm not really sure why. Maybe because of the Jewish history in the Czech Republic. I met my first Holocaust survivor when I was 15 and it stuck with me. Now nine years later I'm lost for words almost. 

At the memorial last night two American tourists came to stand next to me and for about 10 minutes were talking how Israel just wants that land and wants to get rid of the people in Gaza. This was all while the names of the poor people who died were projected on the stage. I just couldn't hold it, I know I should have kept my mouth shut, but I just couldn't, especially on the anniversary of 7/10. I apologised for interrupting and told them that Israel just wants their people back and to get rid of H@mas. I was met with what about ism and if it's okay to kill people. No, of course not. Is it okay to kill 1200 people in one day? I was shown hand gestures that I only know from American films xD. I haven't met such a childish person in a very long time. Again I know I started talking to her and I never engage someone like that, but talking nonsense out loud during a memorial for the victims of 7/10... I just couldn't. I was disguised by the protests around the world before. And I couldn't believe some people just can't give the jewish people that one day of peace. 

If you had told me couple years ago that my 20s would be filled with the vile rise of antisemitism everywhere, I would have laughed to your face. I had thought we were past this. This incredible medieval way of thinking is just unbelievable.

Overall great memorial. We had both national anthems and number of songs in hebrew by Omer Tal. Local rabbi gave a speech, some celebrities and Israeli ambassador to the Czech Republic as well. Israeli exchange student  gave a speech, he lost three friends on 7/10, one of them being Hersh Goldberg Polin.  

I probably forgot a lot of things I wanted to say. Anyway. Keep safe everyone. I honestly adore all of you, Israelis and Jewish people everywhere, for being able to keep up with all of this negativity and hatred. If any other religious/ethnic group faced this everyone would go mental. 

We didn't forget about you here in Prague.

Where time has both stood still and at the same gone by so fast.

October 7 is a date we will never forget,

Our very being as Jews had a button pressed which caused us to be reset.

On that day, we lost over 1200 of our fellow Jews,

And 251 hostages taken, making us constantly glued to the news.

In Israel, this was indeed the worst ever terrorist attack,

Yet worldwide, empathy and kindness is what we sadly lack.

This was an attack on Israelis, and on every single Jew alive,

But despite this, our Jewish spirit has only gone on to thrive.

From the kibbutzim, Nova and Jewish communities geographically apart,

We feel the collective grief as the biggest pain to our Jewish heart.

We still have 101 hostages held in Gaza who we demand- Bring them home now!

The IDF is determined to rescue them in any way how...

Whilst global headlines keep Jewish suffering intentionally vague,

Antisemitism has become intolerable like a Passover plague.

As Jews, a year later, we still feel we are no longer whole,

As one big family, collective grief has become our main role.

What did we do to deserve so much hate?

To have our brothers and sisters go through such a devastating fate.

As we collectively cry in this October rain,

A year later we are still experiencing the very same pain.

Us Jews are united together as one,

We will never let those who hate us stop us from ever shining like the sun.

I promise my Jewish family who now live with our ancestors in Heaven,

We will never forget you and the events of October 7.

Because you are all the apple of our eye,

To the world I reiterate- Am Yisrael Chai!

There was an eerily positive energy there. 

There was an Israeli women with a flag crying and she was being taunted and smiled at by Arab teenagers. They laughed at her and chanted at her. 

I saw a white women handing out newspapers headlines about glory and revolution. I saw whole families with young children wearing kafiyehs. 

I understand that for Palestinians 10/7 represents ‚Äúresistance‚Äù but didn‚Äôt this event lead to an Israeli action that they say constitutes a genocide? How are they celebrating an event that led to 40,000 deaths of their own people? 

How do they continue to promote violent resistance and revolution if it is going to be met with their genocide? How‚Äôs this logical in any way? where is the respect for their beloved martyrs? Or their women and children? 

They know there isn‚Äôt a genocide or else they wouldn‚Äôt be celebrating and smiling. If they cared about their people dying they would not be celebrating 10/7. 

I wanted to carry a big sign that said ‚Äúhow does khamaneis üçÜ taste‚Äù but I figured it was better to get out of there safely. 

The anti semitism in New York is starting get harder to ignore, especially when it comes from white people with college degrees. 

Anyway, thank you Israelis for doing the dirty work for our people and the rest of the world.

May peace and love be the only victor

Right now we are pretty much at the mercy of a coalition of far left and separatist groups that have way too much representation for their population. The Catalan and Basque separatist have always used the israeli conflict to try to make a parallel to their treasonous politics and paint themselves as victims.

The declarations of some of our representatives like ""from the river to the sea"" made by our VP will go down in infamy. 

Just wanted to let you know that most Spaniards are with you guys and I hope that you can bring justice against the perpetrators of oct 7. "
1fyvmej,A Veteran's Perspective: Reflections on A Year of Fighting,2024-10-08 09:21:43,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1fyvmej/a_veterans_perspective_reflections_on_a_year_of/,"*\[Written during the night between October 6th and 7th 2024\]*

I can't fall asleep. I'm sick of this over-sentimentality, but yes, it's been a year. It's funny because a year ago, on the night between October 6th and 7th, I also couldn‚Äôt fall asleep. And by the time I finally did, I woke up to the sound of rockets at 6:30 AM. I thought it was just another round of relatively harmless Hamas shenanigans that would end in a few hours, and I planned to go back to sleep after the first trip to the shelter. But after the third trip, I started realizing something was different this time. A few hours later, I was already in uniform, in my unit's emergency storage, shocked to my core, and on my way to sleep on the floor.

I was in reserves for a little over 200 days this past year‚Äîthree combat deployments as an infantryman, plus some ""sidequest"" roles (mainly because my routine and stability had long since gone to hell, and I had to keep making a living somehow). Of those 200 or so days, about half were spent fighting in Gaza. I witnessed and experienced things so staggering and horrifying that I wish I hadn‚Äôt had to face them. I looked death in the eye more than once, from several different angles. I came back a few weeks ago from another round of combat deployment, and I'm slowly realizing that I'm still not entirely myself. I can't quite remember yet how to go back to doing things, how to communicate with people, or how to just be. I'm exhausted. Everything hurts. My back, my knees (which wore out completely this year, earning me the dubious status of disabled IDF veteran, even though I decided to keep serving anyway). I've been recovering for a few weeks from a virus I caught in Gaza that took me down completely for a while. About a third of my beard turned white this year, even though I‚Äôm only 32. I feel like I‚Äôve aged at least a decade in so many ways. Mostly, I feel like I'm not quite myself, and I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll really feel grounded again.

But you know what? I got off easy from this nightmare. Because I'm alive, and despite everything I've just said, I'll be fine. Thanks in no small part to the tremendous support of my amazing family and friends, I'm slowly starting to function again. I had the privilege of getting to know my fellow soldiers in my company and my platoon, and becoming their brother in this inferno. I learned lessons that will stay with me for life, and I even managed to get accepted into grad school in the midst of all this. Little by little, and perhaps in a slightly different way, I'm finding a way to return and continue to be. Unlike me, so many people can no longer say they‚Äôre fine, and many others are no longer alive. And as this goes on, more people keep joining those lists. I don‚Äôt know what to say, except that this whole thing is so awful. I don‚Äôt know how to contain it, how to frame it, how to feel about it, or how to be with it. I hope it ends soon, so we can stop, break down, grieve, and somehow move on. Because one year like this is already way too much.

I don't really know what I was trying to say, but I had to get it out. I wish us better days ‚ù§

1fytggz,"Was Oct 7th the day when finally, across the world, the quiet part was said out loud.",2024-10-08 06:33:09,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1fytggz/was_oct_7th_the_day_when_finally_across_the_world/,"I support Israel, its people, its history, its legacy, its right to exist, its right to act as it sees fit.

As a westerner I was at first saddened by the reaction in the West, that was then joined by confusion over the pro-Hamas, pro-terror din that came forth, and that has now been joined by a deep anger at the coverage, discourse and the anti-Israel monopoly of the narrative.

Time has been divided. There is now pre Oct 7th time ,a time when darkness was hidden ,when all we saw was the tip of the iceberg , a time that is receeding in our memory.
And there is post Oct 7th time,  a time when the iceberg somehow inverted revealing the true level  of hate that exits in the world for Israel, it's people and all it stands for.

Across the Western world , vast amounts of people, numerous institutions, tens of hundreds of elected politicians, and thousands of media contributors took Oct 7th as a turning point where they could finally, publicly, and with a twisted sense of moral outrage say ' the quiet part ' out loud - they hate Israel, Jews and want it wiped out of existence.

The stadium is full, everyone has finally taken off their coats revealing the jersey of who they really support. 
Oct 7th was just the day when the match kicked off, but this is not a game, this is going to be a fight for the survival of western civilistion.

And it's mostly Liberals who make this anti-Israel outcry, they truly deep down hate western culture and see Oct 7t as a chance to usurp it, whilst in their twisted mind feel morally justified.

If Israel loses, then we who believe in a 2000 year historical arc of western civilisation and evolution of a Judaic-Christian society will also have lost, and there may not be a re-match.

Am chai Israel.

I wish all on this sub reddit well. I think of your people, your history,.your plight and suffering often, but I take comfort in your spirit, your smile. 
The strength of the Israeli people is the only thing that has allowed the west to not bow its head in shame for all we have done and still do to you.

I'm considering converting after studying Kabbalah through meditation practices and studying other religions. I was more curious and figured I might as well learn about Judaism and the Jewish people. So I did. I was born into a christian house hold but left and considered myself agnostic.

After some time I really feel like I more align with Judaism and how Hashem is tought about. Actually having a connection with the divine instead of falling in line so I wont be punished. I also studied the history of Israel and the conflict between Israel and Palestine. I don't like seeing children killed on either side but I have to say after knowing what I know about Palestine and hamas and having my feelings about Islam I have to say I stand with you all amd Israel.

I can never say this to family and friends cause so many of their post are anti israel this ""There is no chosen people or holyland"" that. So many left leaning friends who seem to be all about Palestine but haven't even considered if they would be welcomed in Palestine. I know all too well I can't go there cause of my skin color. I know what they would call me.

So Im so sorry the rest of the world is still showing zero sympathy to you especially on the anniversary of that horrible day. I'm so sorry this world doesn't know they're on the wrong side of history. I can say for sure being a blackman I look at the history of Jews and immediately feel a calling to join you hand and hand cause I understand what its like to walk in a room and be hated just for existing. It hurts my heart seeing all these hateful antisemitic posts and videos. I'm sorry. And I grieve with you. AM ISRAEL CHAI."

A whole year has passed since thousands of people were brutally murdered in their own homes, massacred as a result of unfounded hatred that we must fight at all costs. Civilians who attended a music festival with the simple purpose of having fun, did they deserve this end? I believe the answer is clear. 
We have the obligation to seek justice for those who are no longer with us; to condemn the atrocities that took place 365 days ago, as well as to fight for the liberation of those who are held captive in conditions so hostile that they are beyond my imagination.

A year has passed since we were happy for the last time.

Writing these words is no easy task, but I find them more necessary than ever. Let us not fall into the grave mistake of forgetting or ignoring the unforgivable.

I hope that those of us in pain found some meaning and restoration through reflection yesterday.

For those of us still confused about why the sub was shut down:

On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a genocidal terrorist attack that included the murder of more than 1200 people and the taking of more than 250 hostages. October 7 was the most violent attack targeting Jews since the Holocaust, and included torture as well as the weaponization of sexual violence.

**In remembrance of the victims of 10/7‚Äìand the many hostages who still remain in Gaza‚Äîwe shut the sub down for October 7, 2024, the one year anniversary of this tragedy.**

After 10/7 Israel initiated a war against Hamas and the other terrorist groups that the IRGC of Iran has fueled to destroy the Jewish state. Over the year since we have witnessed the downfall of Hamas‚Äôs and Hezbollah‚Äôs leaders.

**On this day we thus also remember the soldiers who have served in the IDF and sacrificed their lives** to protect not only Israel and its inhabitants (including both the Jewish people, and its diverse minorities, such as the Druze-Israelis) but also the free world.

On October 7, *2024*, we are not victims because we have a state and an army that has protected us, that enforces Israeli sovereignty and defends our right to self determination; **we are not victims today, in short, because we are Zionists**.

*A note on the subreddit and the moderators' experience:*

In the immediate aftermath of 10/7 this subreddit received so much harassment in the form of antisemitism and comments from malicious actors who justified and gleefully celebrated the atrocities of 10/7--or who paradoxically denied it--that it was forced to go private for a prolonged period.

Quoting one of my co-moderators: ""There was an immense flood of abuse and we were also in shock and incapable of doing our job as mods...I don't think any of us had the time or the mental capacity to sift through the abuse and fake news - we were ourselves trying to understand what was going on, missing loved ones, going to funerals, running to bomb shelters...""

To a large degree the increased harassment has not abated. Disturbingly it is during times when Israel is itself the *recipient* of violence--such as during the IRGC missile and drone attacks of 4/13 and recently on 10/1--that the harassment *spikes* astronomically.

This underscores the fundamental nature of antisemitic harassment as a form of hate.

We do our best to remove and report this kind of material but as always we remind our members: if you see something, report it."

Art can help us process experiences, something many of us still are doing a year after the attack.

Paintings allow us to experience, remember and reflect upon an event without looking at photographs, which may be too powerful and painful. Paradoxically, a painting may also evoke broader, deeper experiences and meanings that are more powerful--and sometimes more painful-- than what photographs convey, rendering clear the parallels between the October 7 attack and the Shoah and Pogroms and exiles of the past, for example.

lran shot 181 ""BALLISTlC"" missiIes. 180 = 10 x 18. The Hebrew letters to write 18 is ◊ó◊ô, which also spells ""life"". In Jewish culture, any multiple of 18 (◊ó◊ô) is considered lucky.

They shot 181 (according to lsraeIi sources), 1 more than 10x ◊ó◊ô. That one ""extra"" resulted in a single death, the death of a PaIestinian. While regrettable, you have to see the divine irony.

Also... The gematria of ◊ï◊î◊¢◊†◊ü ""v'ha'anan"" (and the cloud) is 181. That word is used when the Jews had come out of Egypt before crossing the Red Sea. ""AND THE CLOUD (that was usually in front of the Jews, leading the way and creating a safe passage) moved behind them"" (Exodus 14:19). Rashi on this verse says that it was to absorb the missiIes (Rashi uses the word ""◊ï÷º◊ë÷∏◊ú÷¥◊ô◊°÷∞◊ò÷∞◊®÷∏◊ê◊ï÷π◊™"", lit. BalIistics) that the Egyptians were sending.

Meanwhile the IDF spokesman is claiming the opposite.

However the available evidence supports the IDF claims. They have released video of IDF operations in Lebanese territory witn no resistance. Of captured Lebanese homes full of Russian-made weapon, ammunition and equipment. A video circulating on Telegram shows dozens of dead Hezbollah corpses on the ground, seemingly shot by small arms fire like that of an M16 or Tavor type weapon.


About 20 years or so the US forces arrived to Baghdad, and the Iraqi minister of information was still claiming that Saddams army was winning the war, as the American tanks rolled through the background. 

Due to their primitive triablistc sense of ""pride and honor"" some people are totally delusional... I wonder how far the IDF will need to enter Lebanon until the Hezbollah supporters admit the ""battle hardened fighters"" they bragged about aren't so tough when up against an equipped and organized modern force with air support."

Why are rivers not widened? Many rivers in Israel can have a great geo political impact due to Israel vulnerable landscape, such as the alexander river which is a horizontal line cutting from the north of Netanya all the way to the west bank, or the Besor which can be widened to encompass the Gaza strip.

  
Besides geo politics, I can't understand why cities in israel are built beside a river and not on top of it, like in Europe... It can add a nice walkway / promenade that is missing in many cities in our country.

Is anyone here afraid of IDF not being able to achieve such outcome? Its very unlikely for Hezbollah to really decimate IDF's capability, let alone occupy Israeli territory...

But that's not necessarily how defeat looks like when you're fighting guerrilla tactics... If the war ground invasion ends up being a total sh1t show with hundreds of soldiers killed, soldiers of civilians casualties and if IDF is unable to achieve or maintain significant territorial gains then the war is lost, Hezbollah won't be pushed beyond the Litani River and rest assured that they will keep shooting rockets keeping thousands of Israelis displaced from their homes

Some feared a similar Vietnam-like outcome in Gaza and it did not happen... Israel's victory in Gaza is definitive, however, this war against Hezbollah presents new challenges compared to what we went through in Gaza:

1. A more skilled, prepared and armed opponent, also with more fighters

2. Different topography. Lebanon is mountainous as opposed to flat Gaza

3. A more engaged Iran. Hezbollah is their crown jewel among their proxies and they might not let it die so easily. I have no doubt about Israel's superiority over Iran, but getting barrages of hundreds of misiles is definitely a torn on your side if you're trying to win a war.

4. A more tired and worn out Israel: economically, logistically, morally, even the physical state of the soldiers might start declining

5. The lack of a clear and viable long term plan... What are we gonna if we do manage to push Hezb north of the Litani River or even obliterate it? Will we occupy Lebanon? Can we trust that failed state with a weaka$$ army with our security? Hezbollah could rearm and wear us out through guerrilla warfare just like the Taliban did to the US

6. Point in favor of Israel: Hezbollah doesn't have hostages so they can't put pressure on us and create internal division 

Anyway ... Anyone else shares these fears? And if not then why exactly? Share your opinions"

So as the title says, do you think that there will be peace sometime in the near future with Lebanon and Syria or not? If so, should it be conditional from both sides and not just one? In other words, not to have cold peace as we have with Jordan and Egypt, but rather real and true peace between the people and not the governments. I see that we share a lot in common with the people of Lebanon and Syria and I believe that if both sides agreed on having a middle ground to work towards a peaceful solution and stop fighting each other online and offline, then all sides will benefit from the outcomes. All in all, none of us the civilians chose to live in this state of war but we can choose to put an end to it if we truly wanted to. The power is in the hands of the people and not the governments, we are the ones who chose those corrupted governments and can change them too hopefully üôèüèª 

Looking forward to hear your insights on this matter. "

I also understand what it's like to be hated by your neighbours and consistently persecuted by them for your religion.

It might not mean much, but I'm sick of all the hatred Israel gets. You've been betrayed by the world after you've suffered a massacre on your own soil, and to top it off, you're considered the criminals and that the attack was justified for whatever nonsensical reason.

I say forget about the West because they will forget about you. No matter how loyal you are or how much you serve their interests, they'll abandon and disparage you when it suits the political climate. You can only rely on yourselves.

Do what you must without hesitation to secure the interests of your nation. You've effectively destroyed both of Iran's proxies and showed that Iran is impotent to do anything about it. I sincerely hope you save the remaining hostages, even if Hamas's new policy might make that impossible to do. My thoughts are with them.

You're doing everyone a favour by eradicating evil in the world, make no mistake about it. Israel is the hero the world doesn't deserve."

1fw6xbl,Israel was right to ignore the West,2024-10-04 18:59:52,933,https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/israel-was-right-to-ignore-the-west/,
1fw76n2,No one else is letting me ask this,2024-10-04 19:10:53,272,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1fw76n2/no_one_else_is_letting_me_ask_this/,"Hello everyone. I'm not an Israeli. I'm not Jewish (I think? Maybe I had Jewish ancestry). I was raised to hate Israel from a very young age. I traveled to many places in and out of the middle east. I cannot stress enough how hard it is to question anything in this region. 

Bottom line is, I could never hate the Jews. I sympathized with the Palestinians I saw on the news since a young age. But my immediate reaction was to ask, why would someone do this. I was too young to understand racism or antisemitism or anything. But I still knew this was wrong. The responses I got from older people was very simplistic and I was never convinced that a group of people just do this for the sake of doing it. 

Decades later and I can never hate a Jewish person for who they are. But I also noticed that I was growing up, the Israeli side was hidden from most people. The attempts to talk about it were met with hostility and accusations of being zionist. As if being zionist is a bad thing. It's an ideology at the end of the day. But you know in this region you go to prison for thinking outside the box. 

I tried learning the language (not easy to find tutors) and I tried getting familiar with the culture as much as I could. I really tried hearing the other side. And it's such a different story. My stance since I was 15 was, both sides deserve each other and both sides only want war. Both sides are unequal in power but they equally hate each other. I've interacted with Israelis before but only online. And I know that just like any country, there are different groups that support different views on the situation. 

I guess what changed my stance was October 7. I was horrified. Not at the attack because we all saw it coming. I was horrified by the cheers and the gloating. And I was afraid of myself for not being strong enough this time to loudly claim that I'm against all of this. I was silent, probably for the first time. I was so afraid of criticizing the people, maybe because I've never seen them this bloodthirsty before. I was in shock that throughout the year only the Palestinian side was portrayed in the media. When I got my voice back days later I found people like me (a minority but better than being alone) who were absolutely appaled by the attack. And who also thought that Hamas started something that they could not finish and the civilians will suffer for it. A year later and that's what happens. Just like Hezbollah barking and now causing an entire country to be bombed. Just because it decided to attack without votes, without considering that other people don't want to be dragged into this. 

So let me say that I'm sorry for your loss. My condolences for every dead person. My sympathies to those who are still taken by Hamas. 

I'm sorry it has to come to this for people to begin questioning their ideas. I never hated Israel like I was told to do. I watched the starvation and the bombing of Gaza among other places. I think it's inhumane. But I still can't hate Israel for taking such an extreme step. I hate the government for not being good to the people more than I hate the war. Which is fucked up I'm aware.

I've decided to try again and understand both sides. Because after October 7, I don't think my original stance was correct. 

I apologize for the rant. But I really have nowhere else to go and ask about this. What is Israel? What does it stand for? What's it like living there? What do you love and what do you hate about it? I want to know the good and the bad. Stay safe everyone. "

At the time when we were still living in Israel (he went through intense Hamas bombings in 2021), the plan was for my husband to move back to America and I was supposed stay in Israel idk till when (to finish the apartment lease and wait to be invited to America on a spouse visa or something like that for immigration). I was able to leave Israel with my hubby but the plan was for me to come back to Israel after 2 weeks (cuz I didn't quit my job and I thought I'll come back). 
I would've been in Israel if we didn't decide to just stay and find an immigration lawyer in America. I'm still dreading my birthday and I've been depressed and restless more recently. I'm sorry for everyone's that's been going through it and mourning for civilians and IDF soldiers. I know how much Israelis want their loved ones back, how much they're praying for the hostages to return alive. I always keep them on my mind. "

I‚Äôm looking to hear from people who are currently in Israel, especially Tel Aviv, regarding the recent Iranian rocket attack. I want to get a sense of what‚Äôs actually happening on the ground, as I‚Äôm finding it hard to trust the mainstream media. I‚Äôm not a conspiracy theorist, but I do believe that a lot of news gets filtered or doesn‚Äôt fully represent the reality of the situation.

The media is reporting that the Iron Dome intercepted the majority of rockets, and only a few people were injured. But with all the short videos I‚Äôve seen online, it seems like more rockets hit the ground than reported. Can anyone provide more clarity on the situation, especially when it comes to casualties?

If anyone can share their personal experiences or observations, I‚Äôd really appreciate it. Thanks in advance!"

I don't want to see, how many of my brothers and sisters celebrate the day, where Hamas committed genocide and murderd, raped, burned and kidnapped, Israeli and Arab women, children and men.

I don't know what to do on Monday, when I will see, how people, how many of my brothers and sisters in Islam and many more, will celebrate. Should I cry, staying home, to avoid everything that day, or just scream?

The thing is‚Ä¶ you guys know the internet very well. And I really don‚Äôt know what to think about this group as a concept.

Not to mention that the two members mentioned are following pages that make offensive jokes and misinformation pages like Eye on Palestine.

Let's say the cat is out of the bag and Iran officially declares war on Israel until Palestine is free or something. The dreaded 'regional war' is now upon us and the entire *Axis of Resistance‚Ñ¢* sets out to destroy Israel in a long war of attrition.

What would be the best and worst outcomes in such a war? Is it reasonable to expect the US to declare war on Iran, is it naive to hope for regime change? Is it possible that Israel would be so worn out that we sue for peace and make concessions?"

Yet today people somehow refer to them as settler colonists, despite the fact that they were returning to their ancestral homeland.

The Palestinian diaspora of Arabs who left Israel in 1948 and ended up living in Jordan and Lebanon are referred to even four generations later as refugees today. But why aren't they called settler colonists in Jordan and Lebanon? Indeed that is what they are.

It seems the answer is that Israel warmly received all Jewish refugees as full citizens of the new country. In contrast UNRWA has maintained Palestinian settler colonists in Jordan and Lebanon in a kind of perpetual multi-generational refugee apartheid, where they are treated as second class residents.

Maybe if we refer to the Jews of Israel as refugees people would understand why Israel is so critical for our survival. Shanah tovah!"

A lot of my research was reading ""1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War"" by Benny Morris and watching a lot of YouTube debates from [Destiny](https://www.youtube.com/@destiny). Now, I've been debating pro-Palestine protesters at my college campus because it seems almost insane to be against Israel's right to exist.

I just need help rationalizing what appears to be a collective interest in this conflict because it seems like everyone in the world has a strong opinion on this. Anything I learn about Israel is super interesting to me, and I feel like I have developed a sort of unhealthy passion about this country. I heard that many people had the same experience for America when 9/11 happened. I guess my question is what do Israelis think about non-Israelis/non-Arabs who have absolutely no connection to the Middle East injecting themselves in Israel and Palestine, especially given the recent context of the Iranian attack?"

Okay, over a decade ago I immigranted to Canada from Israel with my family. This spring we have plans of going there after 6 years because we miss our family. I keep seeing these screenshots of red locations Israel and I need to know what they mean!! heard no one is flying to Israel right now and I gotta know why. 

Are mine and my families tickets going to get cancelled, should WE cancel the tickets? My Hebrew is very limited because I moved before I went to school so I didn't learn how to read or write but I can hold a conversation. Because of this I can't text my family and ask if they are okay, if it's safe to come, yada yada. I really don't want to have to cancel the tickets because our family are already excited to see us since like I already mentioned, they haven't seen us in over 6 years. 

TL;DR - my family and I have tickets to Israel to see our family and I need to know if it's safe to go since I see a lot of talk about it being less safe than it was previously

But why did it look like, yesterday, that the incoming ballistic misslies also seemed to be fireballs (from videos).  I'd think a ballistic missile would have used up all its fuel on its ""boost"" stage and is now simply a kinetic/newtonian/gravity powered object that shouldn't have a ""fire ball"" associated with it.  

my primary thoughts on why it could be is that perhaps its like reenetering from space where the friction of the atmosphere makes it glow red hot due to the speed its traveling at and therefore it looks like a fireball.  Another possible thought is that if we destroy the missile, its now could be ""on fire"" and that's what we see, but my guess is that idea is definitely wrong.

You are a democratic state that values all the people regardless of sexual orientation or sex, unlike the regimes you are fighting. I hope you will crush these regimes, these theocrats that opress women, gay people etc. I hope one day all of the middle east will be in peace and with no theocrats and terrorists oppressing people. Also, I would like to say that it's a shame that Europe, as of now (unless I'm mistaken), relies on sending messages instead of sending help in the form of money, weapons and soldiers. We share the same values, but you value something that Europe valued, also, once, but now Europe forgot it. The lack of tolerance of evil. When evil attacks you, you answer. Europe doesn't answer, they just accept it. Don't let Israel (and I'm sure you and your goverment won't) become like Greece or the rest of the Europe, where they let anyone conquer the northen part of Cyprus, attack Ukraine, be here while wanting to oppose his/her opressing values on us etc. I hope better days are coming soon."

I'll keep this short and sweet as I know how overwhelmed everyone is at the moment. We don't want war, the majority of us who aren't fanatic smooth brained fundamentalists who have wet dreams about the destruction of Israel. 

Our lives have been stolen away from us, our youth, our resources, our fellow country people, friends- all of them in the name of a cause that has nothing to do with us.

We have never wanted war with Israel, I repeat, most of us want to be left alone and live normal lives in a free country where we won't get beaten for not covering our hair and executed for changing religions.

I hope you understand a good chunk of iranians are on your side, we suffer in the hands of a common evil and none of us will be free unless that evil is beheaded.

Peace. Stay safe."

in the past two weeks, it seems the people slightly forgot. less posts about them in the social media, in the news we see their faces less than before

we must, but we just must to remember they are still there. and we need to bring them home

The reaction around the astonishingly successful attacks on Hezbollah makes me think we are not learning. Yes, the world is a better place without Nasrallah and his goons, and yes, I am glad he is gone. But the amount of glee I see makes me worry the lessons of Oct 7 were not digested yet.

In the meantime, a different terrorist organization will be shooting rockets in solidarity. However, once we've fought  the first terrorist organization for almost a year, we'll turn our attention to the second one and manage to take out their leader and top command in the span less than two weeks.""

I would've definitely guessed the first organization to be Hezbollah and the second to be Hamas. Yet it's been the exact opposite.

Whether or not you believe in God, fate, a higher power, or anything else, there's potent symbolism to have started this Jewish year with such a horrible, painful, catastrophic defeat, and to end it with such a miraculous victory.

I know the work is far from done. We have a lot to deal with. But to me, it feels like someone is putting a salve on our wounds and bandaging them. It still hurts so much, but it feels like someone is offering us some comfort.

However, since no plane besides the Airbus 350-1000 and B777-300ER come close in passenger capacity. We the Airbus 350-1000 can be ruled out because Boeing is American.

So in that case why did El Al pass on the B777-300ER; especially ever since the phasing out of the B747-400?

I'm also wondering if the B787-10 should have been separately. Such as a replacement for the current B777-200ER.

Looking forward to your perspective. And BTW I am Pakistani and send my greetings. I support Israel against Iran, which I perceive as a threat to Pakistan.

It‚Äôs not clear if Netanyahu has made a decision yet but I wonder about people‚Äôs thoughts on the prospect? 

If Israel were to invade and occupy foreign territory then the UN would have yet another argument against Israel but on the other hand Israel will be criticized regardless of what it does. Militarily, it is my view that a ground invasion might serve two functions:

1) create a buffer zone in the north to prevent Lebanese attacks on North Israel as Hezbollah would in such a case rather be focused on reclaiming occupied South Lebanon

2) Increase deterrence to any other countries which are considering attacks on Israel as the loss of territory is what countries fear more than anything else.

A major con - in my view - would be that Hezbollah might be able to mobilize much more people against an Israeli invasion than the recent targeted strikes upon Hezbollah‚Äôs leadership."

Like many of you, I have spent the past year when online defending Israel and doing my best to offer logical explanations for why Israel is in Gaza and why Hamas must be defeated. And like many of you, I have become exhausted by the constant whataboutism. No matter how reasoned my argument, it is always dismissed, because ‚ÄúIsrael bad.‚Äù 

What I realized today is that in the eyes of the Hamasniks, the very existence of the State of Israel is the Original Sin. No matter what horrors are perpetrated by the Palestinian terrorists, they are all justified, because Israel should not exist at all. The tiny Jewish state surrounded by the remnants of the Muslim Conquest is an affront that can never be forgiven. This is why the PLO refused to acknowledge Israel‚Äôs right to exist and why, despite billions of dollars in international aid, Hamas built tunnels and rocket launchers instead of building a thriving nation.

So long as the Palestinians and their supporters reject Israel‚Äôs basic right to exist as a sovereign nation, there will never be peace in the Lavant. So what‚Äôs the solution? I think we need to start with how Palestinian children are educated. They should be taught love and tolerance for others. They should be taught ways to resolve conflict peacefully. And they should be taught that Israel has an absolute right to exist in peace with its neighbors. When the war in Gaza is over, I hope that the moderate Arab states will take it upon themselves to implement a ‚ÄúMarshal Plan‚Äù in Gaza and Samaria that includes rebuilding infrastructure, de-Nazification of the civilian population, and security measures to protect Israel from future attacks."

1gcephl,"Seeking a Pro-Palestinian Counter-Argument to Points on Terrorism, Collateral Damage, and Regional Politics",2024-10-26 06:14:54,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1gcephl/seeking_a_propalestinian_counterargument_to/,"There is an analyst who argued that what Hamas is doing is terrorism, and he provided a detailed explanation for his viewpoint. He said that while the killing of civilians is tragic, those are considered collateral damage when targeting military sites. He pointed out that it‚Äôs not ideal, but the nature of war often means that civilian areas can become unintended casualties when military operations occur. This perspective attempts to differentiate between intentional targeting of civilians and the unintended consequences of military actions in dense urban environments like Gaza.

The analyst also made a distinction between actions taken by state actors and non-state actors. He explained that when a state actor, such as a formal military, attacks a military site, it is considered a legitimate act of war. However, if a state actor deliberately targets civilians, it is classified as a war crime under international law. In contrast, when non-state actors like Hamas attack military sites, it is seen as illegal but not necessarily classified in the same way as terrorism, due to the complexities of their status as non-state actors. However, if a non-state actor directly targets civilians, this is labeled as terrorism because it is considered an intentional effort to instill fear and harm among a civilian population. According to this framework, the attacks by Hamas on civilians in October are being widely labeled as acts of terrorism.

The analyst further argued that almost all Middle Eastern countries would prefer Israel over Palestine, mainly because of the perceived threat from the Muslim Brotherhood. He suggested that the Muslim Brotherhood poses a significant risk to the stability of many Middle Eastern regimes, as the Brotherhood‚Äôs ideology could undermine their monarchical or autocratic rule. In this context, he argued that many of these countries see Israel as a more reliable ally, despite the broader Arab support for the Palestinian cause among their populations. This geopolitical stance is shaped more by a desire to maintain regional stability than by a genuine alignment with Israel‚Äôs policies toward the Palestinians.

I can see all the suffering on the internet, and it makes me sad, but at the same time, the PR game of the Palestinians is strong. Videos and images of suffering civilians, stories of displacement, and the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza are shared widely, shaping global perceptions. Many people sympathize with the Palestinian plight, as they see a community living under what they perceive as a form of occupation and facing immense hardship. However, the visibility of these stories also means that the narrative can be shaped in a particular way, often emphasizing the human toll without always addressing the complex political and military factors at play.

Let‚Äôs not go into the history too much, as both sides claim historical rights to the land. Both Israelis and Palestinians have deeply rooted narratives about their historical presence in the region, each believing they have a legitimate claim to the land. These historical claims often form the basis of national identity and political arguments. For example, Israelis point to ancient ties to the land that date back to biblical times, while Palestinians emphasize their centuries-long presence in the region before the establishment of the Israeli state. Each side‚Äôs history is filled with stories of displacement, trauma, and struggle, making it difficult to find common ground through historical arguments alone. Discussing history often leads to a deadlock, as it quickly becomes an exercise in revisiting grievances rather than finding a path forward.

There are fools on both sides, and while some Israeli generals have committed actions against civilians, there have been instances where they were court-martialed for those actions. The Israeli military has had cases where officers were held accountable for overstepping their authority or violating the rules of engagement. In these cases, the Israeli state has made efforts to show that it holds its own military accountable for wrongful actions. This can be seen as an attempt to differentiate between deliberate policies and the actions of individuals. Yet, critics argue that such measures are often insufficient and fail to address the larger systemic issues of occupation and military control over Palestinian territories.

How would someone with a pro-Palestinian perspective counter these points, especially regarding the definitions of terrorism, collateral damage, and regional alliances? I‚Äôm interested in hearing thoughtful and nuanced responses that can add to the understanding of this complex issue"

My dad was in the military and I grew up with the knowledge that Naxis were evil, and killed over 6million Jews.

Since 2016, I delved more into how our politics actually work. Learned that it was beyond just being Democrat or Republican. In fact, parties can change, and they have. Just read about 'The Southern Strategy' and the 'Dixiecrats'. Examine why the confederacy formed under the Democrats but today Republicans defend confederate monuments.

2020 was when I really started to understand what fascism is, because it became a huge idea during that year after the Floyd unrest. We saw how fascistic Trump was when he wanted to send the military to squash protests, and when he had people beaten so he can do a photo up in front of a church. We saw police double down on their brutality and be endorsed by the right. I watched family members praise police when they knocked down an old man onto the concrete where he bled. That's when I really started to see authoritarian sentiments.

When it comes to antisemitism, when I was younger, I saw what places like Stormfront say about Jews and other minorities. That's when  I first learned about ""The Great Replacement Theory"", a theory in which immigrants are being sent to the US to do ""white genocide"".  It wasn't until Trump was in office that I started to see that theory get more and more mainstream but they didn't say it outright. You had Tucker Carlson spewing the 14 words but switching up some words as not to connect it to the actual white supremacist statement. You see Trump admitting he is a white nationalist, you hear about him having dinner with Nick Fuentes and Kanye West.

In 2017 we had the Charlotsville 'Unite The Right' rally with neo-Naxis chanting ""Jews will not replace us"". Trump said ""There were fine people on both sides"". People like me on the right called that out. Called out conservatives in our families and tried to get them to see that these Naxis are Trump's true constituents.

Now we are witnessing the slipping of the mask. Trump saying that he wishes he had Hiltler's generals, Trump stating that Immigrants are bringing bad genes, Trump stating that ""there's an enemy within"", and when Trump paraphrased Hiltler about immigrants ""poisoning the blood our nation"".

Then you got his supporters like MTG talking about 'Jewish Space Lasers', you got JD Vance pushing a conspiracy theory about Haitians eating pets that was originally pushed by a neo-Naxi group called 'Blood Tribe'.

In regards to Israel/Palestine,  there's a crazy thing about the leadership in Israel. Bibi is cozied up with Trump, Bibi's cabinet has similar fascistic elements that wanna reclaim Gaza, eradicate undesirables and let what they deem the only ""worthy people"" to settle on Gaza. While obviously it is not the same thing as the Holocaust, I would compare it more to a modern-day manifest destiny and the trail of tears.

With all this happening, we are hyperfocused on people who just want a year-long bombing campaign to stop. For group of people living on 2 separate strips of land to stop being bullied and mistreated.

To my Jewish/Muslim/Arab friends, there's an administration that might take office in the most powerful nation in the world. They've shown their true colors, they are the real antisemites, and they are also Islamaphobes. These are your real enemies. These are the people that truly want you dead, they want me dead too because their supporters do not see folks like me and my family as ""real Americans"" because of our complexion.

To our Israeli friends, if you really are concerned for Jewish people, something more dangerous than any Islamic extremist group might take rise in the most powerful nation on the planet, and it will be dangerous for all of us.

Does this mean we should ignore antisemitism from the Arab world? No, it should be corrected. But understand that people from these regions only know of Jewish people from the bombs being dropped on them by a nation that likes to conflate itself with Jews. Kids only know Jews from the framing of Israel's government that conflates itself with Judaism. They would be surprised to hear about all the Jewish people leading the pro-Palestinian protests

Nobody is a monolith, not Arabs, not Muslims, not Jews."

1gc3ivp,Israel's strike on journalists in Lebanon,2024-10-25 20:11:14,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1gc3ivp/israels_strike_on_journalists_in_lebanon/,"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvz2rzm4k0o   

As some of you may have known, Israel launched a strike deliberately targeting a building known to be housing journalists (with clear markings around the building such as a journalist jeep). They struck a compound which was housing journalists who had left the previous area they were in because it was unsafe.  

Multiple media organizations were housing in the compound, and Israel managed to assassinate the pro-iranian and pro-hezbollah journalists. The IDF then said the incident is under review.

This begs the question, what's the point of deliverately targeting journalists like that? Just because they cover news which opposed you doesn't mean they're valid military targets, and especially not at 3 AM while they're housing alongside several other members of the media, in an area clearly marked as press (which all sides were informed of).   

Does this not count as terrorism? Are they trying to make others afraid of criticising israel?  

What's with Israel's vendetta against journalists. And they just say it's under review, I don't even know if I can expect anything to come out of this ""review"".   

Unsubstantiated claims of them targeting red cross or journalists should really not become the norm. Anyone can then accuse their enemy of using ambulances or the press to transfer weapons and suddenly all healthcare staff or journalists become legitimate targets without needing proof of such.   

What do you guys think?"
1gc3e8j,Would an anti Israel liberal like to debate a pro Israel liberal?,2024-10-25 20:05:32,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1gc3e8j/would_an_anti_israel_liberal_like_to_debate_a_pro/,"I have tried posting this on multiple threads and it keeps on getting removed

I was raised an orthodox Jew (still am) and my family was mixed when it came to politics. Even though we were super religious, my siblings and I are on the left and so is my mom. My dad and extended family are on the right. Of course, not everyone‚Äôs on the same spot on the political compass. However, when it came to Israel, as orthodox Jews, we agreed with each other.
As someone part of Gen Z, I heard the very pro-Israel side from my family and the very anti-Israel side from social media and my non-Jewish friends. Hearing both sides that are insanely anti the other side got me really confused. I thought, I‚Äôm gonna do my own research because the info I‚Äôm getting is crazy different. So that‚Äôs what I did. I sought information from different sources, ensuring I learned the history and non-biased explanations on the current situation.
By the way, before doing research, I was pro-Israel. I was scared I would find out something horrible about Israel that would change my view on everything. After doing a lot of research, I was kind of shocked at the information I found. Almost everything people said on social media was wrong. I was shocked by how Israel truly was ‚Äúbeing made out to be the bad guy.‚Äù In the history of how Israel came to be, Israel really wasn‚Äôt the bad guy.
I know some of you are shocked that I‚Äôm saying this even after doing my own research. Usually, when I say I‚Äôm pro-Israel, people claim it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm brainwashed and only listened to what my parents told me. I respond, ‚ÄúActually, I did my own research BECAUSE I was scared that I was being brainwashed. And even after doing research, I‚Äôm still pro-Israel.‚Äù
So, my point is, I would love for someone to message me privately so we could have a political debate on this subject. I feel like most people are very uninformed, especially those who are very anti-Israel. I gave you all of this information so that you know the background of how I am pro-israel and so that you know that I am not brainwashed. If someone wants to debate me on the history of Israel, I would love for you to private message me so we could discuss it, and maybe I‚Äôll even learn something new! I feel like it could benefit both of us. <3

1gbxwcn,The obsession with opposing Zionism is counterproductive to a Palestinian state,2024-10-25 16:08:36,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1gbxwcn/the_obsession_with_opposing_zionism_is/,"The raging debate over Zionism, and the Palestinian obsession with opposing it and blaming it for every Palestinian problem is irrelevant and counterproductive at this point. Zionism is simply the idea that Jews should have their own country in their ancient homeland. It doesn‚Äôt preclude the Palestinians from having a home nor does it have anything to do with what the borders of Israel should be.¬†

So why is the debate about Zionism pointless? 

Because Israel already exists. Zionism, as a decolonialist project succeeded. Israel has been around for nearly 80 years, is a thriving democracy, and simply isn‚Äôt going anywhere. Arguing against Zionism or Zionists is about as productive as campaigning for the eradication of the United States or any other nation-state, which seems to be a favorite pastime of super progressive lefties who, it would seem, care more about slogans than practical realities.

Sadly, people who passionately argue against Zionism and try and equate it with the worst things in the world seem to make the same tragic mistake that the pro-palestinian movement has been making for decades - namely an obsession with dismantling Israel rather than efforts to actually create a Palestinian state. Any nationalist movement that is rooted in the destruction of another is simply bound to fail, as we‚Äôve seen for nearly 8 decades at this point.

The obsession with zionism is why Palestinians have rejected every peace offer ever made - because when opposing zionism is the root cause of your belief system, it suggests that the ultimate goal isn‚Äôt a Palestinian country, but the eradication of Israel and the manufactured boogeyman that is Zionism.

Anti-zionist thinking is certainly productive if you want to rile up the masses into a frenzy, come up with slogans, demonize Israel etc., but it ultimately does absolutely nothing to further along the Palestinian quest for statehood.

As an example, I recently had a discussion with a Pro-Palestinian classmate of mine. I said that ideally I would like a 2-state solution. Palestinians in a country living peacefully next to Israel. His response? ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs impossible as long as Israel and zionism exist. Palestinians have no problem with jews, but the zionist state is on Palestinian land. The problem,‚Äù he emphasized, ‚Äúwas and remains Zionism.‚Äù

The ahistorical aspect of his answer aside, it reflects the problem above - a preoccupation with getting rid of Israel instead of creating Palestine. The obsession with Zionism is a microcosm of this counterproductive and ultimately pointless line of thinking.

Zionism is simply the belief that the jews, like any other group, should have a homeland. It doesnt mean you support Netanyahu, or even the war in Gaza. It simply means Israel should exist.

If Palestinains truly want a country they have to come to grips with the fact that it will beside Israel, not in place of it. Unfortunately, this seems unlikely given the rhetoric one often sees online and from the pro-palestinan movement. It's why many pro-palestinian folks who argue for immediate ceasefire get oddly silent when you point out that a ceasefire by definition is temporary and that maybe a permanent ceasefire (which is a peace treaty and acknowledgement of Israel) is what really needs to happen."
1gbunhr,It turns me off when people say Jews steal other peoples culture since that is a lie rooted anti semitic misconceptions. ,2024-10-25 13:46:59,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1gbunhr/it_turns_me_off_when_people_say_jews_steal_other/,"I see all these people on instagram and TikTok say Jews stole Arab culture in Israel by appropriating words like yala or adopting the cuisine like falafel, shawarma or hummus. That‚Äôs completely untrue they have the anti semitic misconception and think that the Jews in Israel who founded the country and most Jews in general are white European Ashkenazi colonizers. That is a completely false narrative as there is so much diversity within the Jewish community such as Ashkenazim, Sephardim and Mizrahim etc. 

If anything it‚Äôs the opposite and Zionism is anti colonialist as the jews are an indigenous people returning to their homeland which was colonized by non Jews. Jews especially the migrants who made Aliyah and migrated to Israel from places like Europe they just adopted aspects of the local Arab culture and that is a natural progression of culture not stealing or appropriating it. When two ethnic groups or cultures are in proximity to each other they adopt aspects of each other‚Äôs culture or language through mutual influence. 

Their argument for Jews stealing the culture of the Arabs in the region also falls flat because ultimately Jews like Arabs are descended from Semites and the different Jewish subgroups we see today are the result of Jews in diaspora adapted to their new environment and surroundings while preserving their Jewish faith. If anything Ashkenazi Jews adopting words like yala or sababa or eating middle eastern dishes is a way for Jews in the diaspora to reconnect with their ancient middle eastern roots and for ashkenazim its a way to stray away from Germanic Slavic cultural influence and embrace their semitic roots."
1gbuh7v,How Wikipedia‚Äôs Pro-Hamas Editors Hijacked the Israel-Palestine Narrative,2024-10-25 13:38:37,114,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1gbuh7v/how_wikipedias_prohamas_editors_hijacked_the/,"Full article: https://www.piratewires.com/p/how-wikipedia-s-pro-hamas-editors-hijacked-the-israel-palestine-narrative

A coordinated network of veteran Wikipedia editors has been shaping narratives around Israel, Palestine, and affiliated groups with an aggressive bias, intensifying efforts particularly after the October 7 events.

This group systematically sanitizes articles, removing favorable references to Israel, minimizing or reframing content that would implicate extremist affiliations of Hamas, and directing focus instead toward alleged wrongdoings attributed to Israel. The reach and organization of these editors enable them to control narrative direction and shape public perception across thousands of Wikipedia articles, fundamentally altering the tone and context of related content.

Leading editors like Iskandar323 and Selfstudier act as central figures in this coordinated campaign, meticulously excising content they find objectionable or that may cast Palestine or its allies in a negative light. For example, they‚Äôve erased references to Amin Al-Husseini's collaboration with Nazi Germany, a significant historical note that would inform understanding of certain ideological influences on Palestinian leadership. By suppressing such context, the editors foster a carefully curated pro-Palestinian slant, often overlooking or omitting facts that might support Israel's perspectives.

Adding a new layer to this campaign, the ""Tech for Palestine"" (TFP) group has emerged, coordinating efforts through Discord to train volunteers in tactics for shaping Wikipedia‚Äôs coverage. TFP instructs participants on how to alter narratives to be overtly pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel, providing detailed guidance on evading Wikipedia's scrutiny by working in small, rotating teams to avoid detection. The group has even extended its influence beyond Wikipedia, attempting to influence UK Members of Parliament and shape the broader political discourse.

These tactics employ a systematic approach to manipulating Wikipedia‚Äôs content guidelines, subtly evading detection by avoiding direct violation of editorial policies and making incremental, coordinated changes. The result is a steady propagation of anti-Israel narratives that skew the information available to casual readers and impact search engine outputs, such as Google's knowledge panels, that rely on Wikipedia as a primary source.

The propaganda strategies employed here reveal the platform's vulnerabilities, exploiting Wikipedia‚Äôs volunteer-driven moderation model and limited oversight resources, making it difficult for genuine editors to counterbalance these narratives. As a result, Wikipedia has become susceptible to coordinated efforts that shape the public‚Äôs perception of contentious issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, allowing organized groups to push ideologically driven, often anti-Israel agendas. This manipulation distorts the platform‚Äôs intended neutrality and informs global perspectives with increasingly one-sided narratives on complex geopolitical issues.

A few major points from the start of the article itself:

* A coordinated campaign led by around 40 Wikipedia editors has worked to delegitimize Israel, present radical Islamist groups in a favorable light, and position fringe academic views on the Israel-Palestine conflict as mainstream over past years, intensifying after the October 7 attack
* Six weeks after October 7, one of these editors successfully removed mention of Hamas‚Äô 1988 charter, which calls for the killing of Jews and the destruction of Israel, from the article on Hamas
* The group also appeared to attempt to promote the interests of the Iranian government across a number of articles, including deleting ‚Äúhuge amounts of documented human rights crimes by [Islamic Republic Party] officials‚Äù
* A group called Tech For Palestine launched a separate but complementary campaign after October 7, which violated Wikipedia policies by coordinating to edit Israel-Palestine articles on the group 8,000 member Discord
* Tech For Palestine abandoned its efforts and its members went into a panic after a blog discovered what they were doing; the group deleted all its Wiki Talk pages and Sandboxes they had been using to coordinate their editing efforts, and the main editor deleted all her chats from the group‚Äôs Discord channel"
1gbp81a,I am growing increasingly disturbed with pro-Palestinian videos and skeptical of Palestinian GoFundMes. ,2024-10-25 08:10:26,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1gbp81a/i_am_growing_increasingly_disturbed_with/,"For clarification, I myself support the existence of Palestine and the possibility of a two-state solution. 

Ever since October 7, many Palestinians have been creating GoFundMes and turning to various social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram so they can receive money for basic necessities and to evacuate them and their families out of Gaza. By now, everyone on social media has probably seen at least one of these videos. When someone is in a desperate situation, they may do or say anything to try to get engagement and I can absolutely sympathize with this. It‚Äôs heartbreaking to see civilians being impacted by war, regardless on which side someone is on.

Of course, many pro-Palestinian activists abroad wish to try and help spread the word so people can collectively donate for these families. I consider this to be a noble cause. However, the manner in which these activists try to ramp up their engagement is sickening, especially towards individuals who suffer from things such as religious trauma, OCD, psychosis, and anxiety. When people hear the same things repeatedly to them, especially relating to an issue that they are passionate about, it in a way becomes a reality for them.

Over the past year, I have heard these activists say really distressing things to try to guilttrip people into compulsively engage with their content. This is a short list of the things that I have heard people say.

- ‚ÄúIf you see this, Allah / God is watching you.‚Äù(or something along the lines of that, often implying or explicitly stating these things.) They usually imply or state that you will be judged before Allah / God / Jesus based on the actions you take, even though some people who frequently engage may feel like they‚Äôre resented by gods already. 

- ‚ÄúIf you skip me, you kill me. / If you skip this video, you are complicit in these people‚Äôs deaths.‚Äù 

- ‚ÄúIf you skip this video, I hope you get food poisoning.‚Äù (This opening statement actually compelled me to make this post.) Basically, they say that if you don‚Äôt interact with their videos and send money to these people, something bad will happen to you.

Even though I try to spread information sometimes relating to Palestine, I have had to block certain activist creators because they kept appearing on my feed saying the most heinous things for engagement. 

I understand that what civilians in Palestine are experiencing is another level of hell, but the majority of people on social media have nothing to do with this specific conflict. If someone ever dares try to question anything relating to the pro-Palestinian movement from within, they get shut down and are basically gaslit into believing that their concerns aren‚Äôt important because there are ‚Äòworse things going on.‚Äô 

Simultaneously, people in these pro-Palestinian spaces are fed with the illusion that they are directly responsible for heavily influencing world events, almost as if they consider themselves to be the ‚Äòmain character.‚Äô Because of this, these outlandish opening claims on such videos are easily believed and people compulsively engage. Unfortunately, the algorithm senses this and pushes more and more Palestinian GoFundMe videos onto people‚Äôs feeds, trapping them in an endless cycle unless they ignore every single video that pops up and feel the guilt that comes with such a decision. 

Additionally, I suspect some of these Palestinian accounts to be bots / scammers. I recently made a Bluesky account and not even a day after (without interacting with any sort of Palestinian content), someone ‚Äúfrom Gaza‚Äù managed to follow me. On Instagram, countless people ‚Äúfrom Gaza‚Äù have followed me when I have barely made a single comment on any post. I don‚Äôt make Palestinian videos either, so I‚Äôm really confused as to how these people are finding my account. 

This just makes this even more concerning. Someone could easily lie and pretend they‚Äôre from Gaza by downloading videos from other ACTUAL Palestinians and uploading them to their own platforms, and no one would know the difference. 

I‚Äôm making this post because this is the only place where nuance is actually allowed and discussed. I have seen no one talk about this so far. Thank you."

I think for most people on this reddit, we can agree the majority of us do not support martyrdom and I think many of us will choose to live. Hence, naturally our advice to ordinary Gazans is to get out of Gaza, get out of harms way and save your own life and the lives of your family. Are there anyone supporting martyrdom and advicing Gazans to sacrifrice their lives ?

It‚Äôs complicated to save all of Gaza, but saving yourself and saving your family is possible (ordinary Gazan civilians). I think stay far away from Hospitals, UNRWA Schools, UN refugee camps, Mosques, known stronghold/ locations of Hamas operatives such as Jabalya refugee camp (even for people who have not been to Gaza, in our own neighborhood we know there may be areas which are unsafe and best to avoid, similarly in Gaza, people of Gaza ought to know which areas are less safe). 

Remember this little boy Mohammed from Gaza, he is now in Egypt https://www.tiktok.com/@trtworld/video/7369474777486085381

Motaz Azaziah left Gaza and now lives in Doha, Qatar https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/01/world/why-motaz-azaiza-chose-to-leave-gaza-mime-intl/index.html

As someone not directly involved in this conflict, we can only give our advice. They can either accept the advice or reject it, it‚Äôs entirely up to them, we cannot force our advice on them. We dont live in Gaza, we dont know the complexity of the situation. This is made worst with biased reporting, propaganda, fake news, contradictory news further confusing and annoying many people outside this region."

‚Ä¢ quotes from prime minister benjamin netanhaju: 

""We are the people of the light, they are the people of darkness... we shall realize the prophecy of Isaiah."" - dehumanization and genocidal intent

""You must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our Holy Bible"" - invoking amalek, calling upon the mass murder of palestinians in gaza, genocidal intent

‚Ä¢ quotes from president isaac herzog:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an entire nation out there that is responsible. This rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved, it‚Äôs absolutely 
not true. They could‚Äôve risen up, they could have fought against that evil regime.‚Äù - collective punishment

‚Ä¢ quotes from minister of defense yoav gallant:

‚ÄúI am saying here to the citizens of Lebanon, I already see the citizens in Gaza walking with white flags along the 
coast... If Hezbollah makes mistakes of this kind, the ones who will pay the price are first of all the citizens of 
Lebanon. What we are doing in Gaza, we know how to do in Beirut.‚Äù(civilian harm and collective punishment)

""We will end things inside Gaza. I have removed all restraints, [you‚Äôre allowed to] attack everything, kill those who fight us, whether there is one terrorist or there are hundreds of terrorists, [ordering to attack] through the air, land, 
with tanks, with bulldozers, by all means, there are no compromises. Gaza will not return to what it was."" - civilian harm and collective punishment 

""I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed,‚Äù ‚ÄúWe 
are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly"" - genocidal intent, collective punishment and dehumanization

""The fighting will continue to and expand to any place neccesary in the Gaza strip. There will be no sanctuary cities"" - civilian harm and collective punishment

these are just some of the 500+ quotes compiled. im only quoting from high ranking officials in office. full file documenting quotes from israeli officials and officers in comments.

why do western governments blatantly ignore the genocidal intent behind the messages and insist no genocide is taking place? the number 1 false thinking i see of those who do not believe there is a genocide is that the population of gaza strip has doubled. the population does not play as big as a part as actual intent and actions of a genocide. hundreds of human rights lawyers wether independent or with organizations like amnesty international, human rights watch, the UN, doctors without borders have claimed what israel is doing in gaza amounts to genocide. holocaust survivors along with genocide scholars have also classed what israel is doing as genocide. the only people i see argue what israel doing is not genocide is western government officials, extremist influencers and pro-israel accounts. i believe the scholars and lawyers of multiple NGOs have more weight than random influencers and pro-israel accounts, and certainly more weight than hypocritical governments like the US"

I‚Äôm an outsider tyring to better understand the complexities of the Israel-Palestine conflict, and I was hoping you could help me on this learning journey! I‚Äôm looking for recommendations on material that helps me understand the Zionist perspective better.

Right now, I‚Äôm particularly interested in learning more about the Zionist connection to the land of Israel. I have been reading the book 'Land and Desire in Early Zionism' by Boaz Neumann, and he mentions a lot of examples about how early 20th-century Zionists conceptualized their relationship to the geographical land. For example, Neumann describes how Zionist pioneers/settlers (sorry I don't know what neutral word to use here) felt an intimate connection to the land. Here an excerpt from page 2 as an example:

*""The pioneers expressed this desire in descriptions of their experience of beingin-the-Land as an ecstatic, almost mystical sense of actually merging their flesh with its soil, fl ora, and fauna, of achieving a symbiosis with it, as though the boundaries between themselves and the Land had dissolved. Yosef Weitz, one of the first settlers at Um Juni, on the shore of Lake Kinneret (the Sea of Galilee), wrote that he had not really understood the mystery of the Zionist need to possess the soil until he made the ascent‚Äîaliya, the Hebrew word for immigration to the Holy Land‚Äîto the Land of Israel and dug his first trench in Rehovot: ‚ÄúThen, when the scent of the soil rose to my nostrils, I sensed something new that had perhaps been hidden away in some secret place under the threshold of consciousness, awakening and spreading through all my bones and sinews. And the deeper I dug, the sensation of the soil became more profound and spread through me, and the feeling overcame me that I \[must\] embrace the land, merge into it, suck from it the essence of life. The spirit of the generations blew within me from the depths of the soil and I felt, really felt, the powerful connection between me and the soil of Israel.""*

Neumann's examples are all historical but I am interested in learning more about a contemporary Zionist connection to the land. I‚Äôd love to dive into notable speeches, writings, or public addresses by Zionist people‚Äîwhether religious or secular‚Äîthat might give me more perspective on this connection. If you have recommendations for important speeches or documents to read or watch about this topic, I'd love to hear it!"

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eC00Ycsybks&t=1122s

As for my perspective, I agree that people should not be lethally punished just for having terrible views, and Alameer definitely had terrible views about Israeli civilians and such.  At the same time though, I don't understand how anyone who is truly socially progressive and:or who wants coexistence would be acting as though he was just an innocent poet.  Looking at his social media history, he had a
a problem with all Israeli people and blamed Jewish people for the Holocaust.  To me, it begs the question of whether these people know that he had really regressive views, and if so, whether they're overlooking it because he wasn't Caucasian.  I'm very much an egalitarian myself when it comes to Palestinian/Israeli human rights, but I don't think this guy should be propped up as a role model for achieving that, especially by people who are generally progressive, and are perfectly fine with calling out those types of views when they're coming from Western conservatives.  There are most definitely better Palestinian people out to celebrate.  Ultimately, we should all want progress on Israeli/Palestinian equality and such, and celebrating people like Alareer does the opposite, in my opinion.  "

> According to OCHA, only 93 humanitarian trucks were permitted to enter the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom crossing from 1 to 7 October 2024. This represents a daily average of only 13 humanitarian trucks, the third lowest number since October 2023. This is well below the pre-crisis average of 500 trucks per working day.

Well, that's certainly something: only 13 trucks enter now, when 500 entered before! It's a disaster!

Except...

I think you've already noticed something's up.

The ""today"" number is calculated based off Oct 1 to 7. Therefore it's an average over 7 days, a calendar week. But the comparison number is stated as ""per *working* day"", an average over 5 days, a workweek. That results in a figure that's inflated by 40%: 700 trucks over a workweek is 100 trucks a day, but 140 per working day.

This is the proverbial comparing apples to oranges. It's a classic high-school student's mistake. Did UNRWA make a mistake, or is there something else going on?

Turns out, there is indeed something else going on. A lot more, in fact.

##Comparing apples to boulders

UNRWA cites, and links, this OCHA report:

https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-9-october-2024

The numbers in question are at the very bottom of the page. Let's read:

> INCOMING TRUCKLOADS*

> The pre-crisis average per working day in 2023 was 500 truckloads, including fuel.

> *Commercial trucks are not captured in the totals following 7 May, as the UN has been unable to directly observe the arrival of private sector cargo at Kerem Shalom crossing. Fuel is not included.

Here we find, again, our ""per working day"" average, but we find a lot more.

First, that pre-war total was for the whole of the Gaza Strip, not just Kerem Shalom.

Second, this figure was for *all* pre-war truck traffic, including commercial trucks and fuel.

Instead, the current figures are for non-commercial humanitarian trucks, excluding fuel.

So not only is UNRWA inflating the pre-war total by using a workweek average vs a calendar week average; they are also comparing current traffic through Kerem Shalom to pre-war traffic throughthe whole border, and comparing current traffic in non-commercial humanitarian aid excluding fuel to all pre-war traffic, commercial and fuel included.

This isn't comparing apples to oranges, it's comparing apples to boulders. This isn't a mistake you can make on accident: you have to deliberately, selectively ignore information in order to manufacture this particular comparison.

#How the media launders UNRWA's propaganda

This particular discussion was spawned by a user linking me to this NPR article:

https://www.npr.org/2024/02/21/1232605200/humanitarian-aid-gaza-israel

I quote:

> Roughly 500 trucks of humanitarian aid alone ‚Äî never mind commercial supplies ‚Äî are needed each day to meet the basic needs of the people in Gaza, according to Jonathan Fowler, a spokesperson for UNRWA, the U.N. agency that aids Palestinians. 

NPR doesn't cite the exact interview or press conference where Fowler allegedly said this, so I can't check if he really did; however I could find this recent interview with him:

https://x.com/AlArabiya_Eng/status/1846608391096954962

Where he repeats the ""500 trucks"" figure. Here's the transcript:

> I mean, we've been saying since the beginning of this war that we need to be able to get in around 500 trucks of aid a day, and that's 500 full trucks of aid into the Gaza Strip to keep- basically sustain, keep people alive, this is the basic survival amout.

This is consistent with NPR's reporting.

Notice how Fowler himself misreports his own agency's already-dishonest claims: in his telling, the ""500 trucks per working day"" specification disappears, and it turns into ""500 trucks a day"".

This is also depicted as ""trucks of aid"", even though the actual figure, as we've seen, did not in fact include only humanitarian aid.

The pre-war figure wasn't a ""basic survival amount"" either: it was just all truck traffic, including lots which surely did not carry anything to do with survival.

UNRWA lies about OCHA's data, UNRWA's spokesperson then lies about UNRWA's lies, and finally NPR and other publications launder it all, by presenting a completely decontextualised final number that readers are invited to believe based on the authority and trustworthiness of the people involved. NPR and UNRWA wouldn't lie to you, would they?"
1gb3dme,A Small Example of How Reddit Perpetuates Viewpoint Discrimination Against Israel and Supports Misinformation Posting Around the Conflict,2024-10-24 14:03:28,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1gb3dme/a_small_example_of_how_reddit_perpetuates/,"Tl;dr ‚Äî I just got off a 3-day ban for ‚Äúharassment‚Äù from Reddit after challenging a sub‚Äôs permanent ban resulting from me pointing out the lack of substantiation on a video supposedly showing the IDF shooting Palestinian children in the back, but which could actually have been something else entirely for all we know.

(repost, since previous post was removed for mentioning specific subreddits)

Full post --

Most of us know there are certain subs that function as basically just anti-Israel propaganda machines, filled with unsourced claims, outright misinformation, and bans against anyone who challenges or even fails to toe the political line fervently enough. No news there, really. However, I recently had an experience of Reddit admins also supporting this viewpoint discrimination, which was new to me.

A few days ago, a user posted the same post on at least 10 subs, and my algorithm fed several of them to me.¬†From what I can tell, that user exists solely to spam anti-Israel propaganda to as many subs as possible.

The video ([linked here](https://x.com/trtworld/status/1846470380980203788), and you can find it in Reddit by searching the title of that video) shows several individuals running, several people in combat gear following them, then one of the latter firing something and one of the runners falling. The video is grainy, is filmed from above rendering size and perspective difficult, and shows no faces close up (it‚Äôs practically just silhouettes). Without any sort of evidence or citation offered whatsoever, the caption claims ‚Äú**Israeli soldier shoots fleeing Palestinian children in the occupied town of Biddu in Jerusalem.**‚Äú There is a watermark of ‚Äú[TRT World](https://x.com/trtworld/status/1846470380980203788)‚Äù on the video, which is a Turkish government owned news organization with a fairly low rating for factual credibility in its reporting. The video has a second watermark of ‚Äúsource: [@ warfareanalysis](https://x.com/warfareanalysis?lang=en)‚Äù, which is an anonymous twitter account that doesn‚Äôt even pretend to source or back up its claims and seems to mostly retweet things from Al Qassam Brigade, which is presumably where TRT World got it from. There was no news report relating to it, no corroboration for any of the claims in the caption. No credible mainstream news sources had picked it up.¬†

I wrote out a response to the post and posted it to those four subs. I did this as part of my own effort to contribute, in however small a way, to pushing back on misinformation and encouraging critical thinking around the information people consume.¬†This was my comment:

>How can you tell these are children?

>How can you tell this is the IDF?

>How can you tell when this happened?

>How can you tell whether this is live ammunition?

>Why is the only ultimate source for this an anonymous twitter account that mostly retweets messages from Al Qassam Brigades?

>Why have no reputable news sources picked it up?

>If you're not asking yourself these questions, you need to start asking yourself why you're not asking yourself these questions.

(Later on, Al Jazeera [posted the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKxjxHn57u0) on their YouTube channel with this somewhat different caption: ‚ÄúCCTV video shows Israeli soldiers shooting a Palestinian teenager who was running away from them in the village of Biddu in the occupied West Bank. The soldiers then beat the injured boy, before detaining him.‚Äù It was sourced in its watermark to an anonymous Telegram account.)

The responses to my comment were mainly what you‚Äôd expect, often along the lines of ‚Äòhow can you justify shooting children in the back, you monster?‚Äô Most of these people did not care that there‚Äôs no evidence they‚Äôre children at all, or that it might not show anything remotely like what the caption claimed. For example, the video could just as easily be of four armed Jewish Israeli adults five years ago fleeing the police after robbing a shop and then one of them getting shot in the back by a rubber bullet. There is literally nothing in the video to show us that this is not the case‚Äîno indication they are children, no indication they are Palestinian, no indication when it happened, it doesn‚Äôt even seem to be the IDF (isn‚Äôt that the police logo on the van?). In other words, it‚Äôs just an extremely questionable video that could show what they‚Äôre claiming, but could also just as easily show something completely different.

In one engagement (screenshots [here](https://imgur.com/a/7L1871S)) with someone about these issues, someone responded along the Iines that even if they are not children, it‚Äôs still shooting innocents. I responded ‚ÄúHow do you know they are innocents‚Äù? Again, these could have been people running from the police immediately after murdering someone or holding a detonator for an IED, for all we know. We have no idea whether or not they‚Äôre innocent. Anyway, shortly after that exchange, that sub, which will remain unnamed because apparently that results in this post being removed, decided to permanently ban me without any discussion. But because they didn‚Äôt mute me (unlike other subs that immediately banned me for asking these inconvenient questions), I was able to ask why I had been banned. These are the messages from the exchange.¬†

[https://imgur.com/a/LpUeQ4t](https://imgur.com/a/LpUeQ4t)

In effect, they considered asking ‚Äúhow do you know they were innocent‚Äù to be ‚Äújustifying killing innocents.‚Äù This is obviously circular and doesn‚Äôt make any sense‚Äîthe whole point was questioning whether or not they even were innocent. But mods of course aren‚Äôt all good at logic or politically unbiased--they're just people. We had a brief exchange (two messages each) in which I maintained that this ban was clearly politically motivated, and they maintained that I was justifying an attack on a child. Whatever‚ÄîI‚Äôm not going to be able to convince them to change their ways, but I was satisfied I had at least made my point and challenged them a little.

The interesting part came shortly later, when I received a notice from Reddit that one of my direct messages (presumably from that exchange with the moderators, as I didn‚Äôt have any other direct messages in months) constituted harassment. Then immediately another message stating that my account had been banned for 3 days for harassment. There was an option to appeal, which I did, and then that appeal was denied. These are the messages:

[https://imgur.com/a/8h3fn7U](https://imgur.com/a/8h3fn7U)

It‚Äôs pretty hard to imagine how my part of the exchange with the mods was ‚Äúharassment‚Äù any more than their part was. It was two responses from me, and two responses from them. My responses challenged their bias and motivations‚Äîbut that is not what harassment is.¬†I'm not required to mince words in my challenge or to be maximally politic.

Nonetheless, Reddit admins decided both to ban and to deny the appeal. I think this is a pretty decent example of how things play out for people on Reddit who dare to challenge the intense anti-Israel bias and misinformation on this platform. Yet I see people on here all the time claiming the opposite‚Äîthat it‚Äôs anti-Israel speech that is censored, that Hasbara is everywhere, etc etc.

The next time that happens, here is a concrete example you can point them to. Banned from multiple subs for pointing out unanswered questions in an extremely questionable video, and then banned from Reddit for 3 days for not just being quiet about it."

I just wanted to get some perspective on things",2024-10-24 12:08:10,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1gb12h9/hello_i_have_few_questions_i_just_wanted_to_get/,"I am from a country that has abstained in UN resolutions, recognises both countries, doesn't recognise Hamas as a terrorist organisation and advocates for a 2 state solution. Most information I get on SM is too defunct or prejudicial. I just wanted to ask few questions to understand the stance of people on things

1) Why are all Israelis called ""settler colonists""? I guess such terminology makes sense if settled in the West Bank which was recognised as Palestine territory. But I have come across many claims that this term should apply to the entire Jewish population of Israel. The wikipedia article tells me that only less than half the Jews trace their ancestry to Europe with other half coming from other Arab countries and 75% of population of Israelis were born  in Israel itself washttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Jews

2) I think what IDF is doing can objectively called a genocide if not an ethnic cleansing. The occupation of West Bank is also illegal. However, why doesn't anyone take objection to the fact that Hamas was an organisation created and promoted by Israel itself to neutralize opposition to it? Why do ppl who wish to stop IDF activities directly support an organisation promoted by Israel to diminish the Palestinian cause?

3) What is the opinion of the average Israeli on the assassination of Rabin following the Oslo accords? Isn't such radicalism worsening the already bad situation?"

Crazy that what‚Äôs happening in Myanmar with 20k deaths is considered a genocide but yet this isn‚Äôt? Is it not the same exact thing what Israel is doing? To be clear, I‚Äôm giving an opportunity to genuinely explain to me if I‚Äôm misunderstanding something. I‚Äôm genuinely curious how this will not constitute as genocide if they follow through with this plan. As far as I‚Äôm aware this is a direct violation of Geneva.

TEL AVIV, Israel ‚Äî Israel has blocked nearly all food aid from entering northern Gaza for the past two weeks, leaving some 400,000 Palestinians there with no good option, United Nations aid agencies say: Stay and starve, or follow orders to flee to the south, where there‚Äôs no guarantee of safety or shelters for the displaced.

Israeli human rights groups Gisha, B'Tselem and others say Israel quietly adopted a starve-or-leave policy for northern Gaza ‚Äî a policy that Israel may be backtracking from now with pressure from the U.S. to increase aid to the area. In a letter Sunday, the U.S. secretaries of state and defense warned Israel the U.S. might cut off military aid to Israel unless it increases humanitarian aid to Gaza in the coming month.

Those who remain would be considered combatants ‚Äî meaning military regulations would allow troops to kill them ‚Äî and denied food, water, medicine and fuel, according to a copy of the plan given to The Associated Press by its chief architect, who says the plan is the only way to break Hamas in the north and pressure it to release the remaining hostages."

I am currently working on a project that focuses on the connection between antisemitism and the ongoing war in Gaza (2008, 2012, 2014, 2023), and I would really appreciate your help. Specifically, I am looking for examples of antisemitic incidents that have occurred directly in relation to the conflict in Gaza. For my research, I am focusing on countries within the European Union, with particular emphasis on Germany, France, Italy, Sweden, and the Czech Republic.

These incidents could have taken place in various contexts. For example, they could have occurred in public spaces, such as during protests or demonstrations, or in more private contexts, like discussions on social media platforms or in news outlets. If you know of any incidents that have been reported in the media, please feel free to share a link. If the event is something you have experienced personally, I would be very grateful if you could describe the situation and explain how it unfolded.

I am especially interested in understanding the broader societal reactions to the conflict and how this has translated into antisemitic expressions or actions, whether in the form of verbal or physical attacks, hate speech, or other types of discriminatory behavior.

Thank you in advance for any examples or links you are able to share under this post. Your contributions will greatly support my research, and I truly appreciate your help"

Is the daughter of the former Hezbollah leader an innocent civilian ? She is known for her outspoken loyalty to Hezbollah. Idk if she died or not, no confirmation and verification. I am more interested to know if people think she is an innocent civilian ?

>Haniyeh told Al Jazeera on Wednesday that his children Hazem, Amir and Mohammed and several of their children were visiting relatives for Eid at the Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza when their car was targeted in an Israeli airstrike.

Are the family members of the former Hamas leader innocent civilians ? I dont know who is who, what age, if they are Hamas members or not,‚Ä¶journalists today are too lazy to dig deeper. My gut feeling is probably a few of them were of ‚Äúmilitary age male‚Äù children or family members of Haniyeh,‚Ä¶and I was right. Mohamned (Male) was 25. Amir (Male) was 28. Hazem (Male) was 29.

What is the chances they are not involved in Hamas in any way whatsoever ? The news report also mentioned grandchildren. Are they innocent civilians if their parents are prominent Hamas members and their grandfather was the Hamas leader ?

It is estimated there are/were 20,000 to 40,000 Hamas fighters in Gaza ? I assure you they are not all bachelors, they would have parents, wives, many children (Haniyeh has 13 children) and grandchildren‚Ä¶ are the family members of Hamas innocent civilians ? And if Hamas fighters were travelling or living in close proximity with their family which includes their wives, their children, their grandchildren and other family members and they got hit, are they (the Hamas fighters) also to be blamed ? If the Hamas fighter wants to continue fighting for their cause, they can choose to do so without jeopardizing the lives of others.

Why is one side is more tolerant than the other?

If Muslims kept 2 million Jews in a 25x5 mile strip, with no Iron Dome and bombed it every couple of years, killing hundreds to thousands at a time. How welcoming would Jewish communities be toward Muslims then? Think about it, they‚Äôve endured one brutal attack, and it‚Äôs already pushed emotions to the brink. But what if they faced 10? or 12? Would the tolerance be the same?

In my opinion? Absolutely not.

This is bigger than tolerance. For Israelis, every rocket from Hamas represents an existential threat, constant fear of rockets and bombings shapes their daily lives and their national psyche. On the other hand, Palestinians live in extremely harsh conditions, denied basic freedoms or autonomy, and regularly subjected to military assaults. Both sides are living under the shadow of violence, but the power imbalance between them is stark. Israel has high-tech defense systems, a powerful military. Palestinians? Just sporadic rocket fire, often intercepted.

So yes, the imbalance in bias is starkly obvious, but it‚Äôs because the circumstances are so different. If the roles were reversed, and Israel had faced multiple similar attacks that killed hundreds to thousands of their loved ones and countrymen each time, honestly, would anyone really still be talking about tolerance? Simple answer, nope."
1ga70nr,Return of Vietnam War talking points in favor of Israel and the IDF? ,2024-10-23 10:15:04,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ga70nr/return_of_vietnam_war_talking_points_in_favor_of/,"Does the arguments of the ""enemy"" in form of Hamas etc. being interchangeable with civilian population, hiding in supposedly vast networks of tunnels and bunkers that can only be neutralized by completely bombing the area above it, and more pose a reminder to anyone else about very similar arguments used to excuse the atrocities commited by the US military during the Vietnam war? 

The threat of an ever-present enemy that any man, woman or child they encounter could be aligned to was used to justify leveling areas with Napalm and Agent Orange, bombing them with often lacking amounts of thought to the safety of the civilians living there. 

The threat of vast tunnel systems used by the enemy was used for the same effect, and gave a justification for destroying civillian structures with no second thought, much like what is Israel doing with drones, bulldozers and more. 

The vietnamese were also portrayed as basically brainwashed, a hivemind following the enemies ideology, which presented the only reason for why they would be against invading US forces, according to the very same at least, which was convenient to excuse the indiscriminate torture, raping and killing of vietnamese at the hands of the US military. 

I do realize that these are two different conflicts, but I can't help to notice that a lot of arguments in favor of the IDF are basically copies of the very same arguments used in favor of the US military back during the vietnam war, just with the words ""communists"" and ""viet cong"" exchanged for ""terrorists"" or ""hamas"".

And if that is too much of a jump back in time for some, then there are the variations of these very same arguments used in the War on Terror, which were also not questioned as much as they should have been until interest of the conflict simmered down while more and more atrocities commited by the various militaries unter the guise of these talking points came to light.

1ga0tdz,How does it end? ,2024-10-23 03:17:12,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ga0tdz/how_does_it_end/,"To clarify (because imho, this is just another period of war) I mean how does the current periods of armed conflict between Gaza/Hamas and Israel; and Hezbollah and Israel end? I‚Äôve added my thoughts but I‚Äôm curious what honest thoughts people have. 

The Israeli-Hamas conflict at this point is irreconcilable. The October 7th attacks clearly were more than crossing a mere red line. Israel‚Äôs stated goals of recovering the hostages, eliminating Hamas, and ensuring Gaza can never facilitate another attack like October 7th is entirely mutually exclusive with Hamas‚Äô goals. As far as the progress of the conflict, it‚Äôs clear Israel has mostly moved the fighting into Gaza and that Hamas is really only capable of fighting inside of Gaza. There‚Äôs not much to suggest Gaza has the means to go back on the offense. Would Palestinians ever consider that open and armed conflict against Israel doesn‚Äôt gain them anything? Or does Hamas (and uninvolved American tik tok‚Äôers) convince Palestinians that martyring themselves in the name of armed resistance is more amenable to any peace agreement like Jordan or Egypt?


With Lebanon, I‚Äôm pretty surprised that no one seems to care that since 2008, the UN has tried to enforce a UN resolution intended to remove any armed conflict from the Israel-Lebanon border. It‚Äôs clear the IDF have a hefty bill to pay to really push Hezbollah to the Litani river. It‚Äôs clear that Hezbollah likely won‚Äôt stop fighting until the fighting in Gaza stops so does Israel just settle for the long game or is the annihilation of Hezbollah the only viable option? 



I personally don‚Äôt think Israel is ‚Äúon the precipice of collapse‚Äù and groups like Hamas and Hezbollah have come and gone before. I hope Palestinians can find a means to live within their own borders and hopefully pave a road to not fighting wars (that they never have and probably never will win) that can hopefully begin to mirror Jordan and Egypt‚Äôs relations with Israel. Hezbollah on the other hand seems to do more to drag Lebanon into war rather than protect it and other than out of desire to annihilate Israel, I don‚Äôt understand why people support them. "
1ga0cmy,The big lie regarding the 6 Day War,2024-10-23 02:52:09,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ga0cmy/the_big_lie_regarding_the_6_day_war/,"Jewish often proud themselves of the 6 day war, as it was a fantastic success for Israel when it defended against a collusion of Arabian countries defeating them in less than a week.  Except Israel never ""defended"" itself, It attacked the Arabian countries by surprise for the greedy desire of accumulating more land, displacing 300 000 Arabians out of their homes and keeping the rest that stayed on a military government, without citizenship and proper rights.  
  
It all starts with some insignificant attritions with Syria in the border, Israel claims the Syrians are attacking them and thus they retaliate with artillery and air strikes. Here's what Moshe Dayan, defense minister at the time, says about it:  


**Israel provokes neighbours to escalate conflicts into wars to achieve their ambitions**

Moshe Dayan admitted in 1976 that Israel took the Golan Heights out of sheer greed. He said of the Israeli settlers who eventually moved into the Golan, ‚ÄúThey thought about the land of the Golan. I know what went on. I saw them and I spoke with them. They didn‚Äôt even try to hide their lust for that soil. That‚Äôs what guided them.‚Äù According to Dayan,   
  
‚Äú*Eighty percent of the incidents worked like this: We would send tractors to plow in an area of little use, in a demilitarized zone, knowing ahead of time that the Syrians would shoot. If they didn‚Äôt start shooting, we would tell the tractors to advance until the Syrians would get aggravated and start shooting. We used artillery and later the air force became involved*.""   
  
He also said   
  
""*You strike a bastard because he is a threat to you, and the Syrians, on the 4th day of the war, were not a threat anymore*"" (Talking about taking the Golan Heights anyway)  
  
Israel, as they try to do with Iran, provoke the neighbours to escalate the war into their ambitions, Dayan agrees:   
  
""*The nature and scale of our reprisal against Syria and Jordan had left Nasser with no choice but to defend his image and prestige throughout the Arab world, thereby setting off a train of escalation in the entire Arab region*"".   
  
This escalation of course is Nasser(Egyptian leader) moving troops into the Sinai to support Syria and blocking the Strait of Tiran into forcing Israel to stop the harassment.  


**Nasser did not want war, he wanted a diplomatic victory that would make the Israelis stop their harassment and treat the people in Gaza better**

Nasser did not want war, on Wednesday his vice president was going the USA to resolve the issue diplomatically, the clock was set, the Israelis had to do something before a diplomatic resolution came.  
  
There was a good chance to de-escalate the crisis. U.S. Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, stated,   
  
‚Äú*We were shocked‚Ä¶and angry as hell when the Israelis launched the surprise offensive. They attacked on a Monday, knowing that on Wednesday the Egyptian vice president would arrive in Washington to talk about re-opening the Strait of Tiran. We might not have succeeded in getting Egypt to reopen the strait, but it was a real possibility*.‚Äù  
  
  
On 5 June Israel  <SUPRISE> attacked and destroyed Egyptian air force bases and advance positions in Sinai, occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip, all of Sinai and the Golan Heights, and all of Jerusalem in what became to be known as the ‚ÄòSix-Day War‚Äô.  
  
Yitzhak Rabin, chief of staff of the Israeli army, stated:   
  
‚Äú*I do not think Nasser wanted war. The two divisions he sent to the Sinai would not have been sufficient to launch an offensive war. He knew it and we knew it*‚Äù  
  
Menachem Begin, who was a cabinet minister in June 1967, stated, while addressing Israel‚Äôs National Defence College on 8 August 1982, 

‚Äú*In June 1967, we again had a choice. The Egyptian army concentrations in the Sinai did not prove Nasser was really about to attack us. We must be honest with our selves. We decided to attack him*‚Äù.  


**There was no existential threat**

  
Major General Mattytyahu flatly stated: 

‚Äú*The thesis, according to which the danger of genocide hung over 11s in June, 1967, and according to which Israel was fighting for her very physical survival, was nothing but a bluff which was born and bred after the war... While Egyptians had eighty thousand soldiers in the Sinai, Peled explained, Israel had hundreds of thousands of men poised against*  
*them... To pretend the Egyptian forces were capable of threatening Israel's existence not only insults the intelligence of any person capable of analyzing this kind of situation, but it is primarily an offense to the Zahal(Israel military).*‚Äù

  
**The lives of many innocent were destroyed, nothing to be proud for**

  
Often is talked about the spectacular military success and how amazing the Israeli army is, of course very little is said about the complete destruction of thousand of lives. According to Israelis estimates, around 250 000 were uprooted from their homes. The Israelis would often use psychological warfare (as they do today mind you) telling the citizens to flee from their homes during the war, after it has ended they were not allowed to return. This event is known as Naksa.  
  
At the end of the war, Dayan expressed his delight at the exodus: 

‚Äú*I hope they all go. If we could achieve the departure of three hundred thousand without pressure, that would be a great blessing. If we could achieve hundreds of thousands from Gaza crossing with UNRWA approval, we would be blessed.*‚Äù  


**Conclusion**

The truth is there for anyone to see, it is quite obvious Israel was not defending itself and their land grabbing should be more than enough evidence of their evil intent. Not alone Israel was the first belligerent and starter of this was, there was not even a threat to Israel security whatsoever. More than half a century of military occupation, while the world see's the apartheid on South Africa as an irrefutable injustice, the Palestinians could not shake their occupiers, road checks are increased, walls, they have to sue different license plates, roads and buses, cannot move from gaza to the west bank. More than half a million settlers live in the west bank.  
  
In 2019 the Trump administration has recognizes the Golan Heights as Israeli territory, when the secretary state Pompeo was asked if this was the right thing to do he cited none other than the 6 day war: ""Israel was fighting a defensive war, to defend the nation""  
  
TLDR:  
  
6 Day War was a shameless land grab and ethnic cleansing war, Israel never defended itself as it was never in danger, there was absolute 0 threat and they rushed into a surprise attack before any diplomatic solution could have been achieved as they had no interest on it whatsoever, they needed the escalation so they could fulfil their ambitions.

1g9xgol,Did Sinwar commit suicide by GSW to head? ,2024-10-23 00:25:32,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g9xgol/did_sinwar_commit_suicide_by_gsw_to_head/,"Did Sinwar die from tank rounds causing the building to collapse on him, or from a gunshot wound to the head - which may have been self-inflicted? The rough timeline according to various media sources and wikipedia is:

1. Sinwar runs into the building.

2. An IDF tank fires at Sinwar's location and troops advanced into the building, but they pulled back after he threw grenades at them. 

3. IDF then sent the drone to survey the interior, detecting the injured Sinwar, who throws an object at the drone.

4. After entering again the following day, they found Sinwar's body in the wrecked building. Photos show him not in the chair from where he threw the object at the drone but buried in rubble. See: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryPorn/comments/1g5sjm9/israeli\_soldiers\_standing\_next\_to\_yahya\_sinwars/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryPorn/comments/1g5sjm9/israeli_soldiers_standing_next_to_yahya_sinwars/)

The Israeli autopsy report says that he died of a gunshot wound to the head. 

So what is the actual manner of death? Did the IDF shell the building again causing the building to collapse on him and kill him? Or did the IDF reengage and shoot him in the head? Or did he shoot himself in the head before the building collapsed on him? Did the IDF shoot the corpse in the head? There is a gap in the story here. 

And if he shot himself in the head vs. the IDF killing him does that change anything?"
1g9wpba,Gaza resettlement for peace,2024-10-22 23:48:52,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g9wpba/gaza_resettlement_for_peace/,"The ultranationalist conference is pushing for a resolution that I believe will bring peace to the conflict and an end to the fight. Senior officials like May Golan and Itamar Ben Gvir are calling for the resettlement of Gaza. We can see that Israeli civilians with the help of the IDF are already planning on resettling the strip.
I will make an argument as to why the resettlement of Gaza is the only resolution going forward that will bring peace to the situation and will ultimately enable everyone to move forward in peace. I will also highlight which steps can be done to minimize pain. 

1. The Jihad - Many people people claim that if the refugees in Gaza were simply just given a state the fighting would end, or if they didn't live in an open air prison things would improve. These statements are false. The Hamas charter openly called for the eradication of the state of Israel and Jihad against the Jews. The updated charter (that was updated BEFORE 10/7/23 FYI) still would not recognize the state of Israel, did not acknowledge that the state was legally formed, and offered to return to 1967 borders; which was nonsensical since there was NO PALESTINIAN STATE PRE-1967. There were no Palestinian borders to return to, so even the updated charter is simply a Jihadist charter that was made in bad faith in order to give the Jihadists a better opportunity to gain more access to weapons and attack Israel. Again, this updated charter came before the 10/7/23 attacks that were likely planned while the charter was being written. So, we know that Hamas wants all of the land from the river to the sea and they have made public comments like this since the charter was written. Therefore, land concessions will not stop Hamas from attacking. 
Gaza was also not an open air prison as we commonly hear. The people in Gaza are repeatedly heard on camera wishing to return to the days before the way began. Why would they want to return to an open air prison. Before October 7, 2023, Gaza was beautiful, had hospitals, universities, places of worship, great restaurants, stores, and all of the things that made it one of the most beautiful places in the world. The people there know it, which is why they're wishing to return to those days. And guess what? There was still an attack and open support for the Jihad. Not only that, but Gaza before the violent uprisings in the 1980's and early 2000's had NO BLOCKADE AND PEOPLE COULD TRAVEL FREELY AND WORK IN ISRAEL. Don't believe me? Hear it from Gazans who long to go back to the days of the 1980's when they could earn higher incomes in Israel and connect freely with the people of Israel and travel. 
In conclusion, we see that land concessions, like the 2005 withdrawal from Gaza, freedom of movement and job opportunities, and freedom of travel are not enough to overcome the Jihadist mindset that Gazans willingly voted for in 2005 as soon as Israel left. 

2. The settlements will push out the Jihad - When we resettle the strip this will push out the Jihad. It will be very clear who Hamas is and those members can be deported. Those who want to live in peace with Jewish neighbors can remain, but the Jihadists will identify themselves in their anger and can promptly be deported. The resolution is simple. Anyone who has an issue with us taking Gaza back who doesn't want to live side by side with us as neighbors can move to Jordan or Lebanon. Those are the real Palestinian states. Allowing people to move to areas they are culturally aligned with will enable them to live more rewarding and complete lives, while we live in peace with those who want to live with us. I envision a free Gaza under Israeli control completely in which the people of Gaza who don't want to engage in violence or terrorism enjoy the full rights of Israeli citizens after making Aliyah and converting. This will enable them to enjoy the full benefits of Israeli citizenship as brothers and sisters. The conversions and focus on Torah will better enable those who want to join us to discard the previous teachings they sadly acquired due to radical groups like Hamas. Those who don't want to make Aliyah with a formal conversion are free to move to several Islamic states in the region and in Africa that support Jihad. This will ultimately make both groups happier. As a side note, the deportations will be legal because there is no Palestinian state and the refugees are not entitled to indefinitely remain on the land. 

3. Reparations - I fully support giving the refugees reparations who have been stuck in limbo for decades. I believe that each Gazan that doesn't want to make Aliyah under Israel's right of return laws should be given $50,000 per family (10-years worth of GDP per capita in Gaza) to begin a new life in one of the neighboring Palestinian states like Jordan. Medical bills should also be paid for those injured in the war. I get that this is a tough concession for many Israeli's, but for years we made mistakes too that led to an endless cycle of violence. This good will measure will bury the hatchet and allow people to begin new lives with a lump sum of wealth that few were able to ever receive in Gaza. 

4. This destroys Hamas - Implementing this plan will destroy everything Hamas sold to their people and end the war. By offering the Gazans a better opportunity than Hamas ever could (a new life, possible citizenship if willing to convert, and wealth); there will be no reason for Gazans to follow them anymore. This will lead to a new era in peace within the region and prosperity that has not been seen before. 

This is the plan that I am personally sending to leaders in the Israeli government so that we can end this war and move on in peace with other brothers and sisters in Gaza. With US support, this would end the war within weeks. The alternative is the continuous disaster we have witnessed."

Like this image: [https://imgur.com/a/0xrDpTG](https://imgur.com/a/0xrDpTG)

So now Palestine gets the whole continental area, just without the mountains. Any mosques originally on the mountain can be moved down (whole, intact) onto the new flat ground. New houses can also be built on the new flat ground.

Israel gets their Jewish state and the entirety of their holy city. They're also very safe now, surrounded on all sides by the sea which acts as a buffer zone against any possible invasions. The only problem is smaller land area, but in this fantasy world let's just say it's also easy to extend an island to make it much larger.

In theory, would this impossible idea be any good? üòÖ

1g9t841,UNRWA Textbooks Available?,2024-10-22 21:11:07,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g9t841/unrwa_textbooks_available/,"There are many comments I've heard throughout the past year about how Islamic folks are taught from a young age to hate Jews and that they are inferior, etc.

 I have heard much about the textbooks used in the classrooms in Gaza that teach bigoted and negative stereotypes etc about Jews.  Also that these textbooks were paid for by the UN.  I have seen a few videos that show children chanting and singing antisemitic songs but no clear documentation on what was actually taught.  I think that if these allegations are true it should be publicized broadly.  That would go a long way to let people understand the situation better.  So many students/young people in the US are convinced that Israel is committing genocide.  Misuse of the term aside, I think having and sharing that information widely would help dispel some of propaganda aimed at Israel. If the text books and evidence is there and widely publicized it would provided a good counter argument to those in the west that possess inherit sympathy towards Palestinians.    

To add to the question.  If UNRWA When Gaza rebuilds, how can the world (UN) be certain Gazan children arn't being taught the same thing? How can the UN and UNRWA be held accountable?  What is the UN and UNRWA playing at if they are funding such a thing?

Conversely, if the evidence does not exist.  Where is that idea coming from and what is motivation for promoting it?

I am honestly very curious about this since it's been reported and documented evidence from a reputable source would be valuable and enlightening."
1g9r4kv,Hamas started the war on Oct 7th,2024-10-22 19:44:23,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g9r4kv/hamas_started_the_war_on_oct_7th/,"*Except it did not*, since the war was pre-existing, and my thread could end here, but actually, *forget I said anything*, since this is where the true discussion starts.

When an entity (individual or organization) needs to *justify* a war, there is a very effective tool which comes to aid: *propaganda*. A key technique of propaganda is called¬†[demonizing the enemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonizing_the_enemy)¬†(or¬†*dehumanization*). It would be quite difficult to justify killing if the enemy is being portrayed as a human being, perhaps with a family, some children, capable of feeling emotions, loving, suffering. It is much more convenient, when formulating the *Justification of War*, if the enemy is a heartless monster, a sub-human, with no hope of ""redemption"", no hope of changing his/her mind about anything, a monolithic demon, full of hatred and spite: basically, the *source of evil* (or a ""death cult"", if you prefer this terminology).

Under such a constructed framework, a war can be depicted as a ""Good vs. Evil"" ([manichean ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manichaeism)framework), i.e. a ""*just war""*, and killing becomes a tool to eradicate evil and bring back peace. Thus, when justifying wars against State actors, the typical propaganda is that these are *evil* States, rigorously non-democratic (a distinctive point of West propaganda), of inferior moral standing, and the people under them must be ""liberated"" from their ""oppression"".

Centuries ago, when religious/superstitious views of reality were much more rooted, the *Inquisition* burned alive people for their non-orthodox doctrines - these were labelled *""heretics""* (a synonym of evil). During the Crusades, the pope preached and justified the war for the ""holy land"", a *""holy war""* \- namely, sponsoring violence when your religion key message is love and non-violence (even if you are attacked first!), but that is simply one of the many contradictions of catholic religion. In the First Crusade, if you actually managed to survive, [all your sins would be removed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusade_indulgence): ""Whoever for devotion alone, not to gain honour or money, goes to Jerusalem to liberate the Church of God can substitute this journey for all penance"" - basically, moneyless church-sponsored military ""job"". Notice the propagandistic use of the word *""liberate""*, which implies the existence of an *oppressor* (another synonym of evil), and that you are doing a ""*rightful""* thing - you are a ""liberator"" (according to propaganda), instead of the more accurate description of an unpaid, violent, fanatic, armed man.

The modern synonym of evil, as used by contemporary propaganda, is *terrorist*.

The historical parallel is extremely useful to understand an important concept. It is clear that both oppressors and terrorists can theoretically exist. The critique, thus, is not against the existence of such figures, but on its propagandistic use.

It was *extremely convenient* for the Inquisition to label ""heretics"" people whose doctrines were against their own doctrine (the only ""true"" doctrine, according to the beliefs of the Inquisition). It was *extremely convenient* for the Catholic Church to call for ""liberation"" of Jerusalem, implying that the Muslim who ruled the nearby lands were ""oppressors"", ""infidelis"" (Latin word for ""not of the same faith"", since the only ""true"" faith was believed to be the Catholic one). Many more historical examples can be made.

For a sufficiently large group of people, extremists can be found. The propadangistic trick is to *generalize* the extremism of a small percentage of a group of people to all the people in that group. For many reasons involving psychological, sociological and other aspects (which are outside the scope of this thread), some extremists can actually manage to acquire social power within their group. Thus, their *niche* views suddenly are amplified by an authoritian tone, and they can even become ""official"". Dissidents are expelled (or killed), and a polarization process begins, until the only survivors are those who share or (willingly or unwillingly) tacitly comply with the extremist view.

You will always find extremists pretty much anywhere, both in Hamas and in Israel. It is however *extremely convenient* that *only* the ones on the side of Hamas are called ""terrorists"", even if the ones of the side of Israel perform the exact same practical actions. Thus, the difference is not empirical and objective, based on facts and logic, but simply reduces to the surrounding narrative, which is shaped by propaganda.

The title of this thread is an example on another propaganda technique, called [ad nauseam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_nauseam). To anyone which shares the view of [scientific skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_skepticism), questioning your own beliefs, namely self-criticism, is helpful towards a greater understanding. Reality is complex, so [black-and-white thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_(psychology)) is often wrong.

To anyone who wishes to *combat* propaganda by propaganda (fighting poison with poison), when someone says the slogan: ""Hamas started the war on Oct 7th"" (2023), which is a propaganda technique were a single date is ""glorified"", *reply with another slogan*.

Finally, here is my concluding message: learn to identify propaganda, understand its techniques, and actively fight against it. If we agree that searching for truth is an ethical value, and that distortion of truth (or outright lies) is unethical, then a world without propaganda is a better world.

P.S. I will make a simple prediction: this thread will be downvoted to near 0, or even in the negatives."

Despite having clear instructions as to the entrance and exit of the bunker and being fully aware that it had no direct connection tot he hospital per the IDF's video, the BBC decided to tour the hospital itself rather than demanding to see the alleged entry and exit points exposed by the IDF.

It was at this time that Avichay put out a¬†[second Tweet](https://twitter.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1848644476287291576)¬†once again directing reporters to proper locations:

>To the media personnel who are currently participating in the media tour inside **#Sahel\_Hospital** in Haret Hreik‚Äîgo to the specific locations we have revealed and do not waste your time on theatrics inside the medical departments. Go down to Hezbollah's private shelter.

>Dargham Street, Building No. 7, Airport Road, Haret Hreik. **Entrance and exit in Al-Ahmadi Building and Sahel Center Building**.

>Go there.

This too was ignored by the BBC who then¬†[published a tour](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c9818n8v7d8o)¬†of Al Sahel Hospital where (naturally) nothing was found.

Israel's International Spokesperson Nadav Shoshani once again provided the press with¬†[detailed instructions](https://twitter.com/LTC_Shoshani/status/1848721112458227745)¬†on how to access the bunker:

>To all the journalists in Beirut, including those who participated in the press tour in the Al-Sahel Hospital, these are the entry instructions to Nasrallah‚Äôs bunker we exposed yesterday:

>**According to intelligence information, one of the entrances to the bunker, containing more than half a billion dollars in gold and dollars, is on the eastern side of the basement of the Al-Ahmedi building, located south of the Al-Sahel hospital.**

>**The basement is on the second floor down (level -2).**

>**It is important to note that it is possible the entrance is hidden by various means in order to make it difficult to find.**

>We invite you to this site in which Hezbollah is holding money that was taken from the Lebanese people.

Despite having an obligation to seek out and report the facts, the BBC decided to abandon its journalistic obligations and instead carry water for Hezbollah by ignoring multiple detailed instructions on how to access the bunker opting for a performative ""investigation"" instead. In the end, the BBC got the headlines that it wanted but its readers did not get the truth.

1g9jdy0,Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Oppression: When do natural changes in a place‚Äôs geography become an inherent injustice?,2024-10-22 14:24:31,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g9jdy0/schr√∂dingers_oppression_when_do_natural_changes/,"Human beings have always migrated, sometimes in large numbers. Sometimes large numbers of migrants bring with them the technology and cultural capital to attain a much higher standard of living for themselves than the preexisting locals in that place. They do this by extracting, using, distributing, and managing the land‚Äôs resources far more efficiently, and on a much larger scale, than the preexisting locals ever could. And so, the newer group comes to dominate the land, politically and economically, and a power and standard-of-living gap between the newer group and their predecessors becomes evident.

Material inequality consistently produces envy, resentment, and social friction. Greater material inequality consistently correlates with higher crime and more breakdowns of social order. But at what point, in the process I described last paragraph, has the newer group indisputably *wronged* the preexisting group(s)? It‚Äôs not inherently wrong to migrate. It‚Äôs not inherently wrong for the migrating group to make use of the technology and social capital they bring with them, to secure the best standard of living the land will provide. It‚Äôs entirely the preexisting locals‚Äô prerogative as to how much they culturally and socially integrate with their new neighbors. If the preexisting locals choose to remain aloof to the newcomers, and the newcomers honor this choice, then I have a hard time seeing any resulting gaps in living standard, material wealth, or top-level political power as an inherent injustice by the newcomers against the preexisting locals, in need of redress.

Moreover, the newcomers‚Äô greater material wealth and political power, combined with their shorter time living in the land, explains ‚Äî *but in no way justifies* ‚Äî preexisting locals who choose to exploit, steal from, or victimize their new neighbors. And the newcomers *are* perfectly justified in taking reasonable steps to minimize their chances of being targeted.

Major shifts in the demographics of one‚Äôs lifelong home usually don‚Äôt *feel good*. This is especially true if the changes render the place much less familiar to old-timers, and the preexisting locals much less in control over what happens there, than before the newcomers‚Äô arrival. But accepting difficult things that one has no control over is a basic part of life. One of those difficult things is the inevitability of change, as the only constant.

UNIFIL forces were heavily restricted by Hezbollah, and little was done when they reported violations of UN Security Council Resolution 1701.

I've heard people say it's because they lived there 2000 years ago so it's their indigenous homeland, meaning they can return to it. I don't see the logic in that if it means displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians? You want to set a new home in a place your ancestors left 2000 years ago even though there's already people living there? It seems selfish and stupid to me, and then going on to offer a ""two-state solution"" to the already native, established population. Why the hell should Palestinians share their land? They do not have any obligation to share their land with some random people that just appeared one day and claimed the right to it because of some ancient ancestry. The whole thing seems really dumb. Maybe I am not educated enough on the subject or whatever, but by that logic the native americans should have a lot more land in North America."
1g986hs,The claim that Palestine was a country taken by Israel is simply untrue.,2024-10-22 02:54:03,205,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g986hs/the_claim_that_palestine_was_a_country_taken_by/,"First, let‚Äôs clarify something: *Palestine* has always been the name of a region, much like the Amazon or Siberia. It was never a country or nation-state. The name *Palestine* itself was given by the Romans after they crushed a Jewish rebellion in 135 AD, as part of an attempt to erase Jewish ties to the land. The name comes from the ancient Philistines, and they were already gone 2,000 years ago. So the modern ""Palestinians"" claiming descent from them makes as much sense as some random Turk claiming to be the lost prince of Troy.

Now, about the people. Even their most iconic ""Palestinian"", Yasser Arafat, who was born and grew up in Egypt, openly admitted that Palestinians were southern Syrians. In fact, before the creation of Israel, Arabs living in this area didn‚Äôt identify as ""Palestinians"", depending on who would ask, they were simply Muslims or Arabs, with cultural and family ties to Egypt, Syria, and the broader Arab world. It was only after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war that a distinct ""identity"" was engineered.

The claim that Palestine was a country taken by Israel is simply untrue. Before World War I, the region was part of the Ottoman Empire, and afterward, it fell under the British Mandate. There was no sovereign ""Palestinian state"" and many of the Arab inhabitants of the area came later, drawn by the economic opportunities created by early Jewish settlers who began building farms and factories, offering jobs. Even today, Palestinian surnames often show origins from places like Egypt, Syria, and elsewhere, showcasing that many migrated into the region as the Jewish community began to thrive.

Palestine has always been a geographic region, not a nation. The modern Palestinian identity is a relatively recent creation, born from conflict, not history. And while they now claim statehood, the idea that there was ever a historical Palestinian state before Israel is pure fiction.

EDIT:  
  
TLDR: There was never a State/Country/Kingdom called ""Palestine"" and no such a thing as ""Palestinians"" until it became a political/propaganda tool against Jews/Israel."

I'm pro israel but I'll try not to be a jerk about it.  I know a lot of pro-palestinians are sincere.  

It seems the IDF was stumbled upon him by surprise.  They didn't plan to run into him, right?  

* If we believe the IDF was taken by surprise, doesn't that suggest Sinwar's reason for coming out from underground was \*not\* to lead his fighters in battle? Because if they intended to engage the IDF they would have attacked on purpose rather than running into them accidentally. 
* Same as above, if they found him in a building during a routine sweep like one report said, he also does not seem to have been trying to die as a martyr as a symbolic gesture.  

Nothing is what it seems, I guess, but just on a very basic level you would think he would have done something proactive, or premeditated, if it was deliberate.  

There's also the narrative that he was forced to relocate due to pressure from the IDF closing in.  Or that he was trying to escape via the Philadelphi Corridor and he had $10,000 equivalent with him.  

Objectively, what are the pro-Sinwar people arguing? That he decided to come out from underground and fight the IDF?  

What is more likely?  What does the evidence seem to suggest? "

I'm basing the numbers of this UN study of the 24,686 deaths that were fully identified in May 2024.

[https://www.npr.org/2024/05/15/1251265727/un-gaza-death-toll-women-children](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/15/1251265727/un-gaza-death-toll-women-children)

Gaza % of population that is children is 47%.

I'm assuming adult males / females each account for 26.5% of the population.

Based on these ratios, we can estimate how many deaths should be expected per each group if killing is totally random.

The number of actual children and women deaths are provided in the article. We can then deduce actual male deaths.

We then compare the estimated vs the actual. We get 5,344 extra male deaths than expected.

The key assumption: just like with excess mortality as a way to look at COVID, I think it's reasonable to assume the large majority of those excess male deaths are because they were fighting / part of Hamas.

For these numbers, we get a civilian % of deaths at 78%, and a civilian : militant casualty ratio of 3.6 to 1.

Assuming there were 30,000 Hamas members out of the 2.2 million in Gaza, the actual % of Hamas in the population is \~ 1.3%, whereas the % killed in this was was 21.7%.

Since this analysis is only done on identified bodies, I think it is conservative in regards of % of civilians killed. My guess is the bodies that are unable or harder to be located are more likely to be in zones / explosions heavily bombed where Hamas militants were residing.

What happens in other urban battles? I just googled a few

Battle of Bagdad, Battle\_of\_Raqqa, Battle of Aleppo... civilan casualtes are usually 60-70% of total deaths.

This war shows a higher civilian casualty %, but again not all deaths have been identified, I think it could end up a bit lower. I can certaintly understand claim of some war crimes, but genocide?

No, it's yet again another bloody urban war."

This story highlights Eliran Mizrahi, a father of four who committed suicide earlier this year.

He operated a bulldozer in Gaza; his co-operator previously spoke before the Knesset, saying per the article ""\[on many occasions, soldiers had to\] run over terrorists, dead or alive, in the hundreds"" and that as a result the co-operator is no longer able to eat meat.

The co-operator also reports that he/soldiers fed and gave water to civilians, and also that there are no civilians in Gaza.

Eliran had been featured on Israeli TV and social media sharing about how his battalion had destroyed over 5,000 terrorist homes- sadly, it seems the home that needed the most attention was inside this man‚Äôs head.

While Eliran was feted by his countrymen, he had also been criticized on social media by foreigners as a murderer before his death, something that may have added to his trauma.

How widespread is this PTSD and how will it affect the war effort? If a few or more reservists are unable to handle running over hundreds of people with bulldozers, what steps can the IDF/Israel do to get them back in the fight and back in their bulldozer instead of offing themselves? One of the methods in the article is helping IDF soldiers normalize their experience by reminding the soldiers about 10/7, and that 10/7 justifies any actions soldiers have taken after. Is there more that the IDF can do to help IDF soldiers normalize their war experiences?

Per the article, while the total number of military suicides and number of recent suicides and injuries from attempts appear to be state secrets, per military self-reporting, the number is not trending up although again the actual numbers are censored."

A quick summary:

The article ""I Went to Gaza. What I Saw Was a Holocaust"" by Susan Abulhawa describes the extreme devastation in Gaza. It highlights graphic accounts of the violence inflicted on Palestinians, including systematic torture, sexual assault, and mass death, resulting from Israeli military actions. The author critiques the global indifference and the pleasure some sectors of Israeli society allegedly take in the suffering of Palestinians. The piece ends by condemning the destruction of Gaza and the failure of international law.

  
The article is also standing next to a controversy where it was completely blocked by The Guardian's editor-in-chief, sparking an ongoing discussion about bias against Palestinian authors, detailed in¬†[Discontent Deepens Among Guardian Staff Over Palestine ‚ÄòDouble Standard‚Äô | Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com/2024/10/18/discontent-deepens-among-guardian-staff-over-palestine-double-standard/), a quick summary for it as well:

The Novara Media article discusses growing dissatisfaction among *Guardian* staff regarding the newspaper‚Äôs perceived double standards on coverage of Palestine. Internal criticisms have arisen, accusing the *Guardian* of biased reporting and silencing pro-Palestinian voices, particularly during the Israel-Gaza conflict.

Maybe I‚Äôm cynical. I‚Äôm pro-Israel, but I think this is the reality:

The Palestinians have too much pride to stop fighting or give back the hostages. The hostages give Israel a reason to keep fighting. With the hostages returned, Israel would have an even harder time getting western support for the war. Moreover, most Israelis want the war in Gaza to end already. They want to get the hostages back and bring the soldiers home. 

I could see this being a bloodbath that lasts for years with no end. That‚Äôs why Israeli leadership is reticent to talk about the ‚Äúday after‚Äù in Gaza. There is no ‚Äúday after.‚Äù There is just war, and war, and more war, because the Palestinians will never surrender. 

The same goes for Hezbollah. Their pride won‚Äôt let them surrender, much less to a people they consider to be inferior. Southern Lebanon is going to be completely glassed. Israel will probably occupy most/all of Lebanon by the time this is ‚Äúover.‚Äù 

Israel wants this to be the final war. I keep seeing people say, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt kill an ideology.‚Äù Well, they are going to try.

She shared that the trip leaders adjusted the itinerary and made time to hear out their concerns, but when that time came all the complaining attendees skipped and snuck away from the hotel to drink and party. 


She shared that she thinks about that experience a lot, especially when she sees them now sharing not only pro Palestinian but also what crosses over into anti-Israeli sentiments on social media. 


My wife has felt that every time she had questions about Palestinians on birthright and other trips she has been on and within Jewish institutions outside of Israel, space was made and information was provided. 


We're curious if others have comparable experiences to share. She's having difficulty with the notion many share in her circles about those in the Jewish Diaspora having been 'brainwashed' to support Israel. She's found some resonance in the podcast, ""From the Yarra River to the Mediterranean Sea"" reflecting on the experience of how we were taught to think about Israel in the Diaspora, but even in the podcast, none of the host's questions are turned away - instead, they were responded to with humility, education, and encouragement to keep asking more.


I've never been to Israel myself so I don't really have anything to speak to. Obviously we have our own inherent biases because we're both Jewish, but there's an understanding among Jews that no matter how much someone thinks they know about the conflict, it's much more complicated than they can imagine. She's much more supportive of the actions of the Israeli military than I am, but even I recognize that there are no alternatives that will not result in retaliation by HAMAS sometime in the future. "

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/al-qaeda-adviser-calls-for-hamas-to-free-hostages-says-attention-overshadowing-fate-of-palestinian-prisoners/

Successful terrorist organizations end up adopting infrastructure and an organizational hierarchy not unlike a corporation. Publicly-recognized leaders, headquarters, logistics hubs... all the same trappings as Coca-Cola and Disney. They need to do this in order to manage sprawling networks, especially when local networks are headed by aspiring local leaders... without public acknowledgement and enforcement of the supremacy by the umbrella organization, the local groups would just end up competing with them. Consider how corporations buy out smaller competitors.

Yet, the adoption of these structures puts a target on them. Previously, the threat of international condemnation and the fear of reprisals has kept Israel and other nations from eliminating terrorist leadership and management structures. Even the US response to 9/11 largely ended up being limited to Bin Laden... many of his subordinates were left alone and even participated in Afghanistan's government.

Israel is modeling how to do existential damage to these organizations. They're eliminating any leadership that they can locate, they're destroying their infrastructure, and they're smartly attacking the parties supporting the terrorists. Yes, small groups of the terrorists will survive, but the overall organization as it is will die. 

Al Qaeda sees this and knows that if Israel is allowed to continue, other nations, including a possible Trump-led US, will adopt the same strategy... and that scares Al Qaeda. It'll be interesting to see if any other public admonishments of Hamas-led Gaza start appearing. "

Israel is accused of having dropped at least 70,000 tons of explosives on Gaza.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_84_bomb

Israel's heaviest bomb contains 429 kg of explosive.

In the completely fictional scenario where Israel exclusively used their heaviest bombs, and nothing else, we would therefore conclude that Israel has dropped at least 163,170 individual munitions.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_84_bomb#Development_and_use

The Mark 84 is estimated to have a lethal radius of 120 m from the point of impact. 163,170 of those could cover an area of 5,754 square kilometers within their lethal fragmentation radius, assuming we overlap their lethal areas by a factor of 22% to achieve total coverage.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip#Geography

The surface area of the Gaza Strip is 360 square kilometers. That means the minimum number of munitions Israel could have used is enough to cover the entirety of the Gaza Strip 16 times over in their lethal areas.

Put another way, the IAF could have covered every single square centimeter of Gaza 16 times over with the lethal area of their bombs.

https://www.memri.org/tv/hamas-official-mousa-abu-marzouk-tunnels-gaza-protect-fighters-%20not-civilians

Gaza has no air defenses, and the only structures fortified against aerial bombing are used exclusively by Hamas. People can not flee out of the Gaza Strip either.

---

Therefore, if Israel has been bombing ""indiscriminately"", we run into a problem: a population of 2.2 millions that can not run away and does not have meaningful shelter has allegedly been bombed ""indiscriminately"" with enough ordnance to cover every single square centimeter of the space available to them in lethal fragmentation *16 times over*, yet only around 40 thousand have been killed, military or civilian.

How is this possible?

Are mounds of dead simply going unreported by the Hamas-run Ministry of Health?

Are there around a million dead bobies buried under the rubble?

Are the survivors in Gaza simply faiilng to report that most of the population has been killed in the bombardment?

Is Gaza largely constructed out of some hitherto-unknown bomb-proof material, such that actually most Gazans have ready access to robust air raid shelters that can withstand these bombs?

Or maybe, juuuust maybe, the ""indiscriminate bombing"" claim is pure rhetoric, which doesn't stand up to the merest scrutiny, and in reality Israel has made a good effort at choosing targets and evacuating civilians from active combat zones, such that most bombs did not fall on the heads of defenseless people, and therefore the number of dead is much smaller than the number of bombs?

---

Pre-emptive responses

""But Israel bombed this target that had lots of civilians""

Yeah it's possible. I won't even bother investigating the particular claim: let's assume it's true. The statistics still show this is the exception, rather than the norm; if it were the norm, the statistics would be very different.

""There are a lot more dead than reported""

Why? as in, why would Hamas and the Gazans themselves not report these many more dead? ""buried under the rubble"" doesn't explain why friends or family aren't reporting these people dead. A fraction of the dead might literally have nobody looking for them, but you can't claim this is the case for most of them, as would be needed to make up enough extra deaths to fit an ""indiscriminate bombing"" scenario.

""Israel bad! They shouldn't be bombing at all!""

I'm not discussing whether the war is just (though it is) nor whether Israel's tactics are legitimate (though they are). I'm discussing the specific claim that Israel has been engaging in ""indiscriminate bombing"". If you can't respond on topic and must instead deflect, then you're conceding the point."

So many times when the countless dead civilians get brought up, all I see is ""war is war!"" or ""Hamas started it!"" Cool, cool, cool. Got it. 

I'm having trouble wording my questions so if you need me to elaborate, please say so!

1) How many Israeli hostages vs civilian casualties? Example: 5 Israelis being taken hostage is enough for 50 Palestinian civilians to die while the hostages are being saved OR 5 Israeli hostages dying is enough for 50 Palestinian civilians to die alongside them.

2) How many Hamas militants vs civilian casualties? Ex: 10 Hamas militants for every 60 civilians dead is acceptable. (I don't actually think that, it's just an example).

3) How many IDF soldiers to civilian casualties? Ex: 3 IDF soldiers died while their group made a ground incursion or something, and 22 Palestinians died during it.

4) How many Israeli civilian (non-hostages) casualties to Palestinian? Ex: 9 Israeli deaths = 120 Palestinian deaths.

Yes, our REALISTIC number (if you have empathy) would be 0:0 for everything. No death. Only happiness and butterflies. But obviously, that's not reality.

So, when excusing civilian casualties, what would be your tipping point? What's your current acceptable ratio? If you can, please explain your acceptable ratio.

My personal belief is that 1 Israeli life is equal to 1 Palestinian life. So far, it seems like for some Zionists/Israelis, 1 Israeli life is equal to about 13ish Palestinian lives (rounding up HEAVILY to 3,000 Israeli civilian casualties and rounding down to 40,000 Palestinian civilian casualties). If you dispute the 40,000 deaths, how many do you think have actually died, then? 

If I had to put a number on militant/military personnel to civilian deaths, I'd rather it be high to low. So let's say 3 hamas militants or 3 IDF soldiers to one civilian. Again, in a perfect world, it would be 0 to 0 and everyone would be holding hands singing kumbiyah, but we Live In A Society, unfortunately. 

I'm answering my own moral dilemma type question because it would be disingenuous for me to ask you all and not provide my own answer.

What ratios would make you start questioning the IDF/Israeli policy?

Also, because I know some of you will not understand me fully when I say Palestinian life... I'm NOT TALKING ABOUT MILITANTS IF I SAY PALESTINIAN. If I talk about militants, I use that word or Hamas. Palestinians ARE NOT INHERENTLY HAMAS. 

Anyways, would love to see yalls answers. This is a genuine question, not some sort of gotcha, because I feel that a lot of you probably have a specific answer you can give me and it might give me more insight as to why you hold the opinions you do. I won't be arguing against yalls stances in this, I just want to know where you draw the line or what it acceptable to you in the 'fog of war'.

Bonus question!!

If you'd like to, please add what your acceptable ratios of those things were but for the US invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. If you were alive and cognizant at the time, what would you have said your ratio would be? Now that it's 2024, do you feel any different?

1g7yrqk,Choosing neither side.,2024-10-20 13:31:39,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g7yrqk/choosing_neither_side/,"I see no point in engaging in conflicts across continents and taking sides on issues that are far from simple. People often fail to recognize that the situation isn‚Äôt just black and white‚Äîit's not as simple as ""Jews bad, Muslims good."" This is a conflict that has spanned decades, if not millennia. And i'll be glad to hear from your point of view. And lets keep it civil here. Here are my points:

# 1. Historical Claims

* The Jewish people were the second earliest settlers in Jerusalem after the Canaanites, and they are the first continuous settlers still present today.
   * Jerusalem became part of Israelite territory around 1250 BCE.
   * Throughout history, the region has seen various powers (Babylonian, Roman, Byzantine, and Muslim) control it, yet Jews maintain a significant historical claim as the earliest existing people.
   * Even if we consider the duration of their presence rather than who settled first, Jews have lived in Jerusalem for approximately:
      * Ancient and early periods: \~1,194 years (586 BCE ‚Äì 70 CE)
      * Continued presence since the Islamic period: \~1,400 years (638 CE ‚Äì present)
   * This amounts to an estimated total of about 2,500 years of presence.
   * By comparison, Muslims have had control of the region for about 1,400 years (since 638 CE), and this includes periods of Christian control during the Crusades.

# 2. United Nations Approvals

* Critics often claim that Jews are illegally occupying the city, yet they overlook that Israel‚Äôs establishment followed a unanimous decision by the United Nations.
   * Israel did not simply invade and kill locals, this portrayal is misleading.
   * While some may argue that Arab states did not agree to the decision, the UN comprises countries worldwide, and Arab states contributed to the problem by refusing to negotiate at that time, as encapsulated in their slogan: ""No peace, no recognition, no negotiations.""
   * The Arab states could have participated in the UN discussions regarding the partition plan, which likely considered historical claims, but their rejection of the plan ultimately sidelined them. (if you have a stronger historical claim, surely you wouldn't be afraid to be involved in the UN discussion)

# 3. Sovereignty and Right to Exist

* After World War II, the establishment of Israel was widely viewed as a moral necessity in light of the Holocaust, providing a refuge for Jewish people facing persecution.
   * Zionism emerged as a national liberation movement advocating for the re-establishment of a Jewish homeland in response to widespread anti-Semitism and violence against Jews in Europe.
   * Many first-generation Israelis found themselves caught in the crossfire of this conflict, often facing hostility or violence simply for being Jewish.
   * While Palestinians have their own autonomy in Gaza, there seems to be a stronger focus on eliminating Israel rather than improving their economic conditions.

# 4. Complexity of Aggression

* It‚Äôs overly simplistic to label one party as the aggressor or terrorist. However, examining historical events can provide clarity:
   * Notable conflicts include the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the 1956 Suez Crisis, the 1967 Six-Day War, the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the 1982 Lebanon War, the 2006 Lebanon War, and multiple Gaza Wars (2008-2009, 2012, 2014, 2021).
   * A common thread in these conflicts is that they were initiated by attacks from Arab states.
   * Historical precedents go back to ancient Arabia, where conquests led by the Prophet Muhammad included significant violence against Jewish tribes (e.g., the Banu Qurayza).
   * While these historical events may not dictate modern consequences, they are probably a catalyst to the cycle of conflict that persists today.

# 5. Scriptural References

* A significant issue arise when religious texts are interpreted to advocate violence against Jews. And people get uncomfortable especially Muslim when the scripture itself becomes one of the topic as it can be seen as attack on Islam. And as a result, it is impossible to have any further discussion.
* Some scriptures have been cited as inciting violence against Jews:
   * **Surah Al-A'raf 168**: ""He shall fight a war against the Jews and put them to death.""
   * **Surah An-Nisa 155**: ""The Hour will not start until after the Muslims fight the Jews, and the Muslims kill them. The Jew will hide behind a stone or tree, and the tree will say, 'O ...'""
   * **Surah Al-Ma'idah 51-69**: ""O believers! Take neither Jews nor Christians as guardians‚Äîthey are guardians of each other. Whoever does so will be counted as one of them.""
* While many may respond with verses promoting peace and love, these contrasting teachings create a complicated narrative. You cannot deny that the fact that the verses that I just listed exist in the scripture, can be cherry picked whenever it's convenient.

Now if you really think deeply without bias, if you have a religion with millions of followers and some part of their faith is to see the cleansing of your people and have tried to multiple times. Are they acting out of unjustified hatred or self-preservation or both ? My answer is both, but again if we keep up a scorecard. The image of Muslims being pure and only want peace is definitely stained..

I refuse to believe that we have take side on this war. especially when both sides have shits on their end. Some may stink more than the other but that's totally different topic. Not supporting Hamas doesn't make you a Zionist. And not supporting Israel, doesn't make you a terrorist supporter either."
1g7yqku,Captagon: Hezbollah's main financier,2024-10-20 13:30:02,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g7yqku/captagon_hezbollahs_main_financier/,"Hezbollah, operating as Iran's proxy army in Lebanon, has for decades financed its activities with the drug trade in addition to Iranian aid. For a couple of decades now, Hezbollah has controlled the Bekaa Valley and engaged in successful cannabis and opium production. In recent years, the organization has focused especially on the production, smuggling, distribution and money laundering of the income derived from the amphetamine-like synthetic stimulant known by the market name Captagon. Last year, Captagon's market area began to expand from the Middle East to Europe, and Hezbollah and Syria are trying to seek additional growth in the United States as well. Few years ago the Italian police seized in the port of Salerno, around 84 million counterfeit Captagon pills found in containers, with an estimated value of one billion euros, suspected to have been made in Syria to finance the jihadist organization Islamic State (IS). Captagon is a strong reason to classify Lebanon and especially Syria as drug states.



The Captagon deal is estimated to be at least a $10 billion industry in the Middle East. Syria is responsible for 80 percent of the world's shipments, which means that the trade is worth at least three times the country's entire government budget. The business value of Captago, which is held by Hezbollah in Lebanon, is over one billion USD, while Iran's annual aid to the organization is about $700 million.



Hezbollah's drug trade, especially the production of Captagon in southern Lebanon, is a significant challenge to Israel's security and regional stability. Despite Islamic laws against drug trafficking, Hezbollah justifies the sale by targeting the Sunni-majority Gulf states, which are seen as enemies of the Shia Islam represented by the terrorist organization.





Israel's Northern Arrows offensive against the Lebanese terrorist organization, which included targeted strikes and the destruction of terrorist infrastructure, had reportedly undermined the production of the drug in the country and its smuggling to other Gulf states.

1g7w5of,How accurate is the number of 40 000 causalities in gaza today?,2024-10-20 11:00:27,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g7w5of/how_accurate_is_the_number_of_40_000_causalities/,"Why do I believe that the number of 40,000 casualties confirmed by Hamas, which has not been updated in half a year, is likely due to the fact that Gaza is almost completely bombed to rubble, rendering it an uninhabitable wasteland? Communication within Hamas is probably non-existent by now; there is no internet, no electricity, no buildings, etc. There is total chaos, making it impossible for Hamas to operate as a cohesive group or to continue counting casualties and identifying them. The 40,000 casualties are likely only those who have been identified by name; the uncounted deaths, the countless bodies still lying under the rubble, are not included in this figure.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the casualty numbers, which have not been updated for many months, could be much higher. Looking at images of the immense destruction in Gaza supports my belief that the casualty figures are likely much higher.

The common counterarguments that these numbers are too high because Hamas is not a reliable source do not make sense to me. Given the mass bombings of residential blocks and civilian infrastructure, this seems implausible. Daily reports of bombings targeting hospitals, schools, and refugee shelters indicate that hundreds of people are dying, the vast majority of whom are likely civilians."

The admiration and respect are overwhelming, as though people are captivated by his story. I even saw an American blogger in a video saying, ""My only wish in life was to shake his hand."" In Japan, where the culture of sacrifice and dying for one‚Äôs homeland‚Äîthe Samurai way‚Äîis deeply rooted, there is an extraordinary sense of reverence, respect, and honor for him.

The occupying force could have easily manipulated the narrative, as they are well-versed in such tactics. They could have shown him wearing women‚Äôs clothes to mock him, filmed him escaping in fear, or depicted him trapped in a tunnel surrounded by bodies, calling him a coward. They could have staged the scene with a bag of cash beside him, claiming he was caught disguised and fleeing. They had every reason to make his final moments disgraceful. But God blinded their hearts, and they failed. Instead, they inadvertently turned him into a global symbol of defiance.

Abu Ibrahim‚Äôs last stand was nothing short of extraordinary. Despite his grievous injuries‚Äîhis right hand severed, his left hand badly wounded with the index finger and part of his palm cut off, his leg nearly amputated‚Äîhe tied his wrist to control the bleeding and sat upright on a chair, just like a proud king, waiting for his enemies. Even with hidden wounds, his posture was unyielding.

When a drone drew close, he swung at it with a stick, refusing to yield even in his last moments. It was one of the most remarkable scenes I have ever witnessed. His resilience was unparalleled, a strength surpassing that of even the most powerful commanders leading fully armed armies. In those final moments, he embodied both the dignity of faith and the honor of resistance.

This scene will stay with me for the rest of my life. It was as if he was engaged in a private act of worship, praying alone in the presence of his Lord. No one was with him, and no one saw him, yet his strike with the stick resonated far beyond the physical act. It was a declaration to the world: ""We remain here.""

Tears well up in the eyes, and sorrow grips the heart. Truly, we are heartbroken by his departure. But death is inevitable‚Äîeveryone faces it. Is anyone truly immortal? Yes, Abu Ibrahim is immortal, by the will of God. What we do in this fleeting life echoes in the eternity of the hereafter.

As the Palestinian poet Abdul Rahim Mahmoud, may God grant him martyrdom, said:

""I will carry my soul in the palm of my hand
And throw it into the abyss of death.

Either a life that pleases friends
Or a death that enrages enemies.

The noble soul has two goals:
To face death and achieve its desires.""

..

This is the heartfelt wish of most Egyptians, including myself. God willing, we will join the battle soon.
Goodbye for now, Abu Ibrahim, until we meet soon. ü´°‚ù§Ô∏è

1g7vgxf,What would you give up for peace?,2024-10-20 10:11:22,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g7vgxf/what_would_you_give_up_for_peace/,"I don't know how many people this sub have direct connections to Israel / Palestine. For those that do, I would love to know what you can't compromise on and what you would compromise on for peace?

I live in Israel, am on the Pro Israel side. 

What I want primarily is the safety of the citizens of Israel. 

I believe no one will protect the Jews except ourselves and therefore What I would not compromise on is giving up Jewish sovereignty. In a one state solution situation, I would be happy with some dual government and constitution or something that makes sure both Jewish and Palestinian lives will always be protected. Meaning a kind of dual Jewish and Palestinian sovereignty. No idea how that would work. But as long as Jews are apart of that sovereignty I'd be happy. 


What I would give up for peace:
It's unfortunate that the land we are fighting over is so incredibly small. If it were larger I would be all for giving up half the land today and would be more than happy for Palestinians to have their own fully recognised state today with a military and everything that comes with sovereignty.

Unfortunately giving up the west bank today would put almost every inch of Israel in extreme close proximity to any potential attack which means almost none of Israel would be safe, and everything would become like sderot. Due to this reason alone I would be willing to give up control and land slowly with the end goal of Palestinians to get their own state within the 67 borders, or pretty much any borders splitting up the land. I would take 40% of Israel. I would even give up Jerusalem although I would absolutely hate to do this. I would be willing for the government to spend some of my taxes on helping the support and building of a Palestinian state. 

I would be willing for a very restrictive return of Palestinians to Israel. Meaning first and foremost I care about the safety of the current civilians, so would be willing to let in vetted people only who has at least 1 grandparent that was born in Israel proper. 


For the Palestinians what would you be willing to give up? 
Some ideas could include violent resistance and the claim to the entirety of Israel. "

It's very important to hear the experiences of people who survived during this genocide and get a picture of their reality that they're living in order to understand the broad scope of the situation. Media outlets have been doing very good jobs with Israeli or zionist voices, I wouldn't necessarily say Jewish voices because that's not the case that we see since a lot of them are silenced by just dubbing them anti semitic or other words like that. It's more the independent media than the government media that gets to bring both sides to talk on these things. For people like moataz azaiza, palestia, wizardbisan and others as well who have been using their personal platforms to showcase a reality despite being shadowbanned at times that people who have been oblivious to the scope of the situation now actually know what it's like to be living in parts of Palestine under Israeli occupation whether it be before or after October 7. Also a lot of times outsiders get to say their views on the intentions of palestinians but they never actually hear the Palestinians talk themselves about what they want and their goals in life. Many accusations have been thrown on innocent people and fear had been utilized to allow for horrible things. Oblivion is why it takes people so long to discover the oppressions done under their names, people in powers utilizing their oblivion to continue with their political cause or gain. It is why it takes so long and many lives lost before people can wake up from the distractions around them and focus on what is important. I would like everyone to give it a chance to hear in this interview one of the Palestinian voices as a step to better understanding others and hopefully making wiser decisions. For so many years there have been a system for dehumanizing the Palestinians in order to facilitate their killings and this is a strong step in erasing this injustice. If you don't think you're dealing with a human or a soul like you that has emotions like you and aspirations like you, it becomes easier for you to kill them and feel nothing about it. Not listening to voices of people like him continues the lagacy of not knowing who are those Palestinians, what do they want, what are they fighting for and instead of listening to them answer we listen to their oppressors answering on behalf of them which does not make sense. So many times we don't even get a chance to listen to these voices since they're buried in every way possible so please give it a chance and listen to him talk about his experience."

I was born in the Caucasus region of Russia to a culturally Muslim family, but we moved to the U.S. when I was 6. While I still observe some traditions and religious customs, I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a fully practicing Muslim.

Growing up, I was always pro-Israel, with many Jewish friends, as well as Muslim friends. I never made a distinction between them and was fully supportive of the Jewish state. Coming from a region that lost its statehood long ago as part of Russia, I understood the importance of having a homeland.

While I support Israel, I also feel empathy for the Palestinians. I believe they deserve their own state, but they‚Äôve been unlucky with their leadership and circumstances. Unlike the wealthy and influential Jewish diaspora, Palestinians haven‚Äôt had access to the same resources. My stance is neutral‚ÄîI‚Äôm a strong supporter of a two-state solution.

In this specific post, I am curious why would Hamas attack civilians on October 7 instead of going after Israeli leaders? 

Israel catches enemies in any part of the world.

1) Hamas could have targeted Israeli leaders in Israel proper. 
2) Or, they could have gone after people like Bibi and his buddies in other countries, as Israel has done to Hezbollah and Iranian leaders.

That being said, he absolutely outted Basseem's emotionally ridden and childish understanding of the Israel/Palestine conflict. Baseem usually ran away from pretty softball questions and when pressed on it, the best that he could provide was ""I don't know"" or try to make pretty malleable equivalcies, he tried the pompous sarcastic demeanor here too and tripped over himself.

Baseem's arguements were all packaged with ""Civilians dying is bad"" which is pretty agreeable right? But when Konstantin presents him with examples in the past like the bombing of Dresden and how it was neccesary to defeat the evil of Nazi Govt. of Germany. Baseem flatly says its wrong but fails to provide another alternative solution....He continues on by doing the same hyperbolic strawman of ""the world doesn't see Arabs as humans so there death count means nothing"" so he doesn't have to get into the nitty and gritty ""proportionality"" arguements.

Nonetheless, I thought he was a change of pace from the usual voice in mainstream media regarding the conflict but his world view and understanding is very infantile and he is unable to provide any ideas beyond complaints.

When it comes to Trump, or Netanyahu; I prefer to take a measured stance based on their merit, and how it compares to other politicians and statesmen we know of from recent history and contemporary times. 

Speaking of Netanyahu; I understand those who hate him because of his unwillingness to continue the peace process that would have given the Palestinians a state. But seeing things as they are now, was it really wise to consider giving the Palestinians a state? 

Some blame Netanyahu for the high cost of living in Israel; and I'm no economist, but it seems to me that even the poorer segments of Israeli society enjoy a Western standard of living. 

Most importantly, Netanyahu is credited for making Israel the ""startup nation"". 

As for Netanyahu's corruption charges; I'm not here to proclaim that Netanyahu is a saint, but I don't see him as nearly corrupt as someone like Vladimir Putin, to deserve so much hate.

When it comes to him cozying up with the most radical right wingers in the state; I don't like him for it either, but I don't believe that he is very fond of those crazies himself, it's a matter of political survival for him; the centre-left could have formed a coalition with him as well were they not so deranged of him. 

And then we have the failure of Oct 7th and this is where I disagree the most;

I am of the opinion that before Oct 7th it was not just Netanyahu but the entire country that had a wrongheaded conception of the Palestinian issue and their supporters abroad such as Iran and their proxies. 

Yes, Netanyahu allowed Hamas to receive money from Qatar, but again, Netanyahu's conception of the Palestinian issue is that he can't give them a state because their political institutions are weak, and their population is radical, and besides, you have Iran.

Netanyahu, as did many people in Israel, believed that Palestinians can be reasoned with once they have economic peace. 

This faulty conception, is what many believe led to the failure of Oct 7th. 

And as far as I can remember many people in Israel before Oct 7th held this particular conception regarding the Palestinian issue. "

both of these books position themselves as ‚Äúdebunking,‚Äù or at least providing an alternative to, the common perception of israeli/palestinian history, but my problem is that most of what i know about the conflict already comes from pro palestinian sources, so i‚Äôm not always sure what specifically is being ‚Äúdebunked‚Äù in the first place.

like i said, i‚Äôm not looking to have my mind changed, instead what i am looking for are books or other media (documentaries, youtube videos, etc.) that will give insight to the ‚Äútypical‚Äù view that most israelis/supporters of israel have of the history of the conflict, so i can better understand the counter arguments being presents by the palestinian side.

i don‚Äôt really care about anything being balanced or unbiased, and in fact i would prefer recommendations that are more biased towards israel"

According to the article: 
> The OCHA report said around 600 mainly olive trees have been burnt, vandalised or stolen by settlers since the start of the harvest. It included a picture of a Palestinian man standing next to an olive tree stump with its branches sawn off.

Video of the aftermath:   
https://www.reddit.com/r/InternationalNews/s/JF9R2GSwTg   

How can this be justified? It's one thing to target enemy fighters, even targeting weapon stockpiles, but how can this be justified. This was a deliberate process of cutting down every single olive tree in sight.   

Illegal settlers in the west bank are already a big problem, but when these already illegal settlers go on and do such heinous actions, why isn't more done to prosecute them?   

Not only is this deliberately damaging nature, it's effectively cutting off families of their source of income. Olive trees are a huge asset for many people in the region.  

What do you guys think of this?  

> OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke said at a Geneva press briefing. ‚ÄúThe olive harvest is an economic lifeline for tens of thousands of Palestinian families in the West Bank.‚Äù  

Do you think justice will be actually served? And if so, do you think reparations would be carried out?  

> Israel‚Äôs military said it had launched an investigation into the reported attack in Jenin and the commanding officer there at the time has been suspended pending the checks.

1g7bv3o,"Peace is possible, the initial challenge is making both sides willing",2024-10-19 15:51:03,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g7bv3o/peace_is_possible_the_initial_challenge_is_making/,"Willing to make peace in the first place, willing to have dialogue on the matter.

The Israeli / Palestinian conflict goes far back in history and is riddled with deep scars, that can feel very personal to many when they run that deep.

I think this conflict is the most prime example we have of humanity's generally collective condition of being driven by pride and identity rather than peace. But it can change gradually, as more people realize one by one what really matters.

People must be willing to foster negotiation and compromise, this can only come about through dialogue between members of both sides who have sincerely decided that this is the right course of action. This is super challenging when you consider how personal the conflict can feel to so many, but that shouldn't deter us. I encourage everyone to see difficult challenges as opportunities rather than something to shy away from.

It has to be founded on mutual respect and the commonality of all humanity. If people are willing to shed light on those parts of their psyche, this can actually go more smoothly than one might think.

-Both nations have a right to exist and thrive. Dehumanization is not what we want here.
-Shared sovereignty is possible, there are multiple models being discussed by peace activists that allow both groups to share the land without selling anyone short.
-Mutual trust will happen over time, we have to start small and gradually build it up with consistency. Both parties will show a willingness for peace and a mutual respect, and it will increase as it continues.

I wish everyone the best."
1g79bnb,Some more Ex-Israeli  perspective (2),2024-10-19 13:49:08,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g79bnb/some_more_exisraeli_perspective_2/,"I wrote my perspective on the situation in Israel a week ago  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g5875n/exisraeli\_view\_on\_the\_current\_war/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g5875n/exisraeli_view_on_the_current_war/)

I got very harsh response from pro-israelis, which attack me personally and completely ignored the point I raised about my experience in israel, and although I do agree that my experience are personal they still reflect the state of israel, especially when considering the never ending war who raise to a new level almost every day...

Today I read an interview with Yuval Noah Harari  
[https://www.ynet.co.il/entertainment/article/yokra14113107?utm\_source=taboola\_internal&utm\_medium=referral&utm\_content=internal](https://www.ynet.co.il/entertainment/article/yokra14113107?utm_source=taboola_internal&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=internal)

Amazing to see that he basically saying the same things as I do:

""The root of the conflict lies in myths and fantasies. People on both sides believe that God gave them the entire land, and that the other side doesn't exist at all or shouldn't exist.

""It's quite astonishing to hear Palestinians seriously say, 'The Jews have no historical connection to this land; they are colonial occupiers who came from Europe.' How can one so easily ignore 3,000 years of Jewish history? And it's no less astonishing to hear Israelis seriously say, 'There is no such thing as a Palestinian people.' How can one ignore the millions of people living around us, their history, and what they say and feel?

""People love simple stories, but reality is complex. The truth is that there is a Jewish people; it has the right to self-determination and a deep historical and cultural connection to this land‚Äîand at the same time, there is also a Palestinian people, which has the right to self-determination and also has a deep historical and cultural connection to this land. As long as we continue to deny reality, we will continue to fight.

""The mechanism of reality denial is working overtime in the disagreements within Israeli society as well. For example, there are many Israelis who deny that Benjamin Netanyahu has any responsibility for the failure and massacre of October 7. The man has been ruling here for 15 years, quick to take credit for every good thing that happens in the country, but when it comes to failures, it's as if he doesn't exist. It's clear to me that a prime minister is not responsible for every decision of a brigade or company commander, but a prime minister has one critical role: to shape the country's priorities. When Netanyahu formed his last government, he had to choose which of Israel's many problems this government would focus on. He could have chosen to focus on the cost of living, the Iranian threat, Hezbollah, Hamas. He chose to focus on the Supreme Court, as if that were the greatest threat to Israel. If, in the months before October 7, his government had dedicated a quarter of the attention to Hamas that it dedicated to the Supreme Court, the massacre would not have happened. And yet, many Israelis are convinced that Netanyahu has no responsibility for the disaster.

""This is a general human phenomenon. When reality clashes with our strong beliefs, we often cling to our beliefs and deny reality.""

He also talks about why he left Israel, for the same reason I mentioned:

""I wouldn't want to live in a place where its spirit is dead. I am a thinker and a writer, and together with my partner, we run an international company with about 20 employees in Israel and around the world, which has projects in dozens of countries. In our work, we sometimes criticize not only powerful people in Israel but also some of the countries, ideologies, corporations, and influential figures worldwide. We cannot work from a country that lacks adequate protections for the rule of law, academic freedom, and freedom of expression, where the court is subordinate to the government and the university lives in fear of the police and the Minister of Education.""

""I will not work from a country that does not protect the rule of law."" 

""Following the judicial overhaul, we have already closed all our investments in Israel‚Äîreal estate and such‚Äîand transferred most of the money to countries whose finance ministers believe in more scientific economic theories rather than help from the heavens. Regarding money, work, and residence, the safest option is in democratic countries with stable rule of law. Beyond that, I have no advice to give.""

He also mentioned that half a million left, mostly intellect modern people who drive the success of israel forward

And just like I said:  
""The country will be more nationalist, more religious, poorer, with worse healthcare services ‚Äì but it will exist. It just won't be a place I would want to live in.""

He talks about peace - most people in Israel don't see any option for peace, since they don't trust the Palestinians, Israeli perceive the peace talks as the main fault for the attack on Israel

  
""The Oslo Accords failed significantly‚Äîbut that happened a quarter of a century ago. What led to the horrors of October 7 and the terrible violence of the past year were not the Oslo Accords or the disengagement, but rather Netanyahu's failed policies over the last 15 years.""  
  
""After October 7, it was crucial to fight Hamas and Hezbollah and defeat them. But a military victory has no value if it is not translated into a political achievement. If we end this war with Israeli garrisons in Gaza and Lebanon, without allies in the Middle East, and under a global boycott ‚Äì that will be a defeat. If we end the war with a peace agreement, as part of a strong regional alliance that enjoys broad international support ‚Äì that will be the greatest victory in the history of the State of Israel.""

Edit: people asked me how I define my self as a non Jew that grew up in Israel, here is my detailed answer 

I never felt related to any fiction story about religion, nationalities.

My parents identity them self as Jews, but they look completely Polish, so for me it just another fiction.

I grew up in kibbutz next to Eilat, and could never understand why Im supposed to feel affinity with people live in tlv even though I never met them, and feel that the Jordanian that I can see every day are my enemies 

When I left the kibbutz, living in tlv was completely foreign to me, I felt like an alien 

Obviously, I never want to join the army and fight in this absorbed fanatic war... But they raped me into doing so... Until I went out on kaban

When I left the army, people told me that I will always be an outcast in Israel, so already then it was clear that it is not my home.

For many years I wandered around, mostly in Europe and India, but always had a limited visa which made me come back to Israel.

Most of the time, I was able to live a decent life in Israel, although I was never comfortable with my tax money paying for Israel wars. But I was optimistic that the people of Israel are good people and will find a way to be good to each other and their neighbors.

A few years ago, my partner left me, it was a good relationship, mostly because I made it a point be as good as I can to her.

But one day she flipped, told me that it is over and never talk to me since - it wasn't a big surprise because I knew she did it to all of her parents, and some of her girlfriend as well

But it made me think - I did my best to be good to her, but we never really talk about the truth - that the relationship is nothing but a game and that one day she will flipped (I did try once but her response was extremely childish)

Than it made me realize, that many of the people around me don't actually tell the truth, they always play this manipulative game.

But not only around me - every where i look- politician, people who I do business with, people who I rent their service.

Even my father who was extremely violent to us is now scammed us and steal my mother heritage - even is a kibbutz member (yotvata) which means that he is laying to the kibbutz, he never supposed us financially and the kibbutz supposed to provide for him...

I can go on and on how I realized, that I just need to look and everywhere I see people laying and cheating - all the way down from the government, to the house owner, who steal from the people they rent to, down to the Palestinians.

Israel was becoming a mess, with the government becoming fanatic and passing un democratic laws , riots everywhere...

It was clear that a blood bath is coming, and I didn't want anything to do with this, and why would I?
I didn't have a loving partner, and pretty much gave up on the idea, I didn't trust almost any of my friend, I was living just to pay tax and rent, for a government that see me as a cash cow.

I sold everything and left... 

Now after a year, I was able to get a refugee status in Brazil, and looking back on all of this, I couldn't contain reading all the Israeli lies in the network... Just felt that I need to give my perspective on this.

And like I said, it is only my perspective, shaped by my experience, but still it is clear that Israel is in a deep mud, and need to rethink it's entire concept

1g7173u,"With Sinwar gone, the hope of getting all hostages back is also gone",2024-10-19 04:33:02,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g7173u/with_sinwar_gone_the_hope_of_getting_all_hostages/,"With Sinwar gone, Hamas is probably factioned. It will be impossible for Israel to make every faction agree on hostages deal. Israel will have to be very generous, and no the threat of Bibi hunting if they don't return the hostages don't count. 

As we know, Bibi will never put forward a good deal. And whatever shitty deal he propose, even if the next leader of Hamas agrees to it, all the sub factions with hostages will never agree to it. 

Israel can try military, with great risk of endangering their life as seen before. But, there is no possibility to get all of them back. 

 I am just wondering how long will this war drag on. Israel can also punish Gazans, like right now as they are trying  to starve part of the population to drive them out, but it seems like the moment Israel goes extreme and try to kill hundreds of thousand America reigns them in. 

If Trump is elected, Israel might push a little further and starve whole northern Gaza to death according to the generals plan, but I don't think that would bring the hostages back.

So, realistically there is no way to get them back right now. 

I think Israelis also understand this, which is why I have seen very different tone on Nasarallah vs Sinwar's death. On Nasarallah's death most people were cheerful and celebrating. With Sinwar, although people are cheerful there is also this uncertainty that's looming.

To end this, the only way to get all of them back is the deal Sinwar wanted. But as Bibi will never agree to that, the possibility of getting all of them keeps diminishing. "
1g70wou,Breaking Down Claims Of Starvation By The IPC (Part 2),2024-10-19 04:15:01,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g70wou/breaking_down_claims_of_starvation_by_the_ipc/,"**What is the IPC?**

[According to its site](https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipcinfo-website/ipc-overview-and-classification-system/en/):

>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is an innovative multi-partner initiative for improving food security and nutrition analysis and decision-making. By using the IPC classification and analytical approach, Governments, UN Agencies, NGOs, civil society and other relevant actors, work together to determine the severity and magnitude of acute and chronic food insecurity, and acute malnutrition situations in a country, according to internationally-recognized scientific standards.

>The main goal of the IPC is to provide decision-makers with a rigorous, evidence- and consensus-based analysis of food insecurity and acute malnutrition situations, to inform emergency responses as well as medium- and long-term policy and programming.

>The IPC was originally developed in 2004 to be used in Somalia by FAO‚Äôs Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU). Since then, a global partnership of 15 organizations is leading the development and implementation of the IPC at global, regional and country level. With over 10 years of application, the IPC has proved to be one of the best practices in the global food security field, and a model of collaboration in over 30 countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia.

**Where is it being used in the context of the war in Gaza?**

The UN, other organizations, and the mainstream media use the IPC as a source to claim there are catastrophic levels of starvation in Gaza.

This can routinely be seen on the almost daily [flash updates](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-16-october-2024) published by The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs on its site where as of October 16th it claims 495k people in Gaza are facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity based on the IPC projection for May through September 2024.

>Note:

>While reviewing the details from my previous thread on the topic, I noticed a subtle but deceptive change in the wording used by the UN to describe food insecurity in Gaza. This dishonest framing replaces the word ""projected"" with ""facing"" creating the impression that Palestinians are facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity rather than it simply being a projection.

>It should also be mentioned that the projection currently in use by the UN was inflated by a staggering 115.3% (based on the most recent data published by the IPC) not only making it factually incorrect but resulting in the continued spread of disinformation regarding the war in Gaza.

https://preview.redd.it/jm3kfyne0lvd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=70d9d074814b4d214386f3c0d5343a8f5752a806

**What are the IPC food insecurity classifications?**

The IPC uses three food classifications, Acute Food Insecurity, Chronic Food Insecurity, and Acute Malnutrition.

https://preview.redd.it/imnhw3wjwkvd1.jpg?width=929&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7692d7fad108936a8f5bf48dbe2bd9143e22aaee

In the context of Gaza, only the Acute Food Insecurity scale is being used. As stated in the image above this classification ""Identifies areas and populations with food deprivation that threatens lives or livelihoods, regardless of the causes, context or duration.""

The Acute Food Insecurity scale is further broken down in the following chart:

https://preview.redd.it/pdbfpc8lwkvd1.jpg?width=925&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=050940868e2ec8c229b149b5e8b447a0128acdf6

What is the current and former IPC analysis for Gaza?

>Based on a [report](https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1156872/?iso3=PSE) published by the IPC on March 18th 2024, 30% of the population was facing Phase 5 catastrophic food insecurity between February and March with a projected 63.5% increase between March and July to 50%.

>On June 25th an [updated report](https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1157065/) was released showing 15% of the population facing Phase 5 catastrophic levels of food insecurity between May and June with a projected 44.5% increase between June and September to 22%.

>In the most [recent report](https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1157985/) published on October 17th, 6% of the population was reported to be facing Phase 5 catastrophic food insecurity between September and October with a projected 159.3% increase between November and April to 16%.

>Note:

>When comparing the projections of each report to subsequent reports we find that the report from March overestimated its projection by 105.4% while the report from June overestimated its projection by 115.3%.

>It should be noted that this calculation assumes the 'current' value in each analysis was accurately reported despite its extreme implausibility (detailed below).

**Combining the data with the IPC classification reference table with a primary focus on mortality:**

https://preview.redd.it/56pxe6tmwkvd1.jpg?width=817&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7be63231498f99a075d2fc766fcefd899b513a81

Based on the reference table, phases 3-5 are where malnutrition start impacting mortality. As such we will only calculate the expected deaths from these classifications for people in those groups.

**Feb-March**:

>26% of the population or 577,963 people were facing Phase 3 food insecurity. If we divide 577,963 by 10,000 people we get 57.7. We then multiply that by 0.5-0.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 28.8-57.1. This means between February and March (29 days) there would have been 835.2-1,655.9 Phase 3 starvation deaths during that time period.

>39% of the population or 875,618 people were facing Phase 4 food insecurity. If we divide 875,618 by 10,000 people we get 87.5. We then multiply that by 1-1.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 87.5-174.2. This means between February and March (29 days) there would have been 2,537.5-5,051.8 Phase 4 starvation deaths during that time period.

>30% of the population or 676,636 people were facing Phase 5 food insecurity. If we divide 676,636 by 10,000 people we get 67.6. We then multiply that by >2 to get an expected daily death rate of >135.3. This means between February and March (29 days) there would have been >3,923.7 Phase 5 starvation deaths during that time period.

Conclusion: According to the IPC there would have been **over 7,296.4-10,631.4 starvation deaths** during that period.

**March-July (projection):**

>12% of the population or 265,309 people were projected to face Phase 3 food insecurity. If we divide 265,309 by 10,000 people we get 26.5. We then multiply that by 0.5-0.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 13.2-26.2. This means between March and July (122 days) there are expected to be 1,610.4-3,204.4 Phase 3 starvation deaths during that time period.

>38% of the population or 854,290 people were projected to face Phase 4 food insecurity. If we divide 854,290 by 10,000 people we get 85.4. We then multiply that by 1-1.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 85.4-170. This means between March and July (122 days) there are expected to be 10,418.8-20,740 Phase 4 starvation deaths during that time period.

>50% of the population or 1,106,945 people were projected to face Phase 5 food insecurity. If we divide 1,106,945 by 10,000 people we get 110.6. We then multiply that by >2 to get an expected daily death rate of >221.3. This means between March and July (122 days) there are expected to be >27,009.4 Phase 5 starvation deaths during that time period.

Conclusion: According to the IPC there would have been **over 39,038.6-50,953.8 starvation deaths** during that period.

**May-June**:

>51% of the population or 1,148,301 people are facing Phase 3 food insecurity. If we divide 1,148,301 by 10,000 people we get 114.8. We then multiply that by 0.5-0.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 57.4-113.6. This means between May and June (31 days) there would have been 1,779.4-3,521.6 Phase 3 starvation deaths during that time period.

>29% of the population or 642,864 people are facing Phase 4 food insecurity. If we divide 642,864 by 10,000 people we get 64.2. We then multiply that by 1-1.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 64.2-127.9. This means between May and June (31 days) there would have been 1,990.2-3,964.9 Phase 4 starvation deaths during that time period.

>15% of the population or 342,719 people are facing Phase 5 food insecurity. If we divide 342,719 by 10,000 people we get 34.2. We then multiply that by >2 to get an expected daily death rate of >68.5. This means between May and June (31 days) there would have been >2,124.8 Phase 5 starvation deaths during that time period.

Conclusion: According to the IPC there would have been **over 5,894.4-9,611.3 starvation deaths** during that period.

**June-September:**

>41% of the population or 913,156 people are projected to face Phase 3 food insecurity. If we divide 913,156 by 10,000 people we get 91.3. We then multiply that by 0.5-0.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 45.6-90.4. This means between June and September (92 days) there are expected to be 4,195.2-8,316.8 Phase 3 starvation deaths during that time period.

>33% of the population or 745,437 people are projected to face Phase 4 food insecurity. If we divide 745,437 by 10,000 people we get 74.5. We then multiply that by 1-1.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 74.5-148.3. This means between June and September (92 days) there are expected to be 6,854-13,643.6 Phase 4 starvation deaths during that time period.

>22% of the population or 495,291 people are projected to face Phase 5 food insecurity. If we divide 495,291 by 10,000 people we get 49.5. We then multiply that by >2 to get an expected daily death rate of >99. This means between June and September (92 days) there are expected to be >9,113.3 Phase 5 starvation deaths during that time period.

Conclusion: According to the IPC there are expected to be **over 20,162.5-31,073.7 starvation deaths** during that period.

**September-October**:

>49% of the population or 1,044,353 people are facing Phase 3 food insecurity. If we divide 1,044,353 by 10,000 people we get 104.4. We then multiply that by 0.5-0.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 52.2-103.3. This means between September and October (30 days) there would have been 1,566-3,099 Phase 3 starvation deaths during that time period.

>31% of the population or 663,721 people are facing Phase 4 food insecurity. If we divide 663,721 by 10,000 people we get 66.3. We then multiply that by 1-1.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 66.3-131.9. This means between September and October (30 days) there would have been 1,989-3,957 Phase 4 starvation deaths during that time period.

>6% of the population or 132,987 people are facing Phase 5 food insecurity. If we divide 132,987 by 10,000 people we get 13.2.

This means between November and April (151 days) there are expected to be 5,481.3-10,856.9 Phase 3 starvation deaths during that time period.

>41% of the population or 875,573 people are projected to face Phase 4 food insecurity. If we divide 875,573 by 10,000 people we get 87.5. We then multiply that by 1-1.99 to get an expected daily death rate of 87.5-174.2. This means between November and April (151 days) there are expected to be 13,212-26,310 Phase 4 starvation deaths during that time period.

>16% of the population or 344,839 people are projected to face Phase 5 food insecurity. If we divide 344,839 by 10,000 people we get 34.4. We then multiply that by >2 to get an expected daily death rate of >68.9. This means between November and April (151 days) there are expected to be >10,414.1 Phase 5 starvation deaths during that time period.

Conclusion: According to the IPC there are expected to be **over 29,107.4-47,581 starvation deaths** during that period.

>Note:

>In the most recent report, the entire strip is falsely classified as being under IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) despite 63% of the population being in Phase 3 or lower. When divided by area, 65% of the Deir Al Balah & Khan Younis Governorates are Phase 3 or lower, 55% of the Northern Governorates are Phase 3 or lower, and 55% of the Rafah Governorate is Phase 3 or lower.

**After reviewing the data does it add up with on the ground reports of starvation deaths?**

According to a recent [report](https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/09/30/they-destroyed-what-was-inside-us/children-disabilities-amid-israels-attacks-gaza) by Human Rights Watch (citing the Hamas run Ministry of Health in Gaza), 38 people have died due to severe malnutrition (which includes those with pre-existing medical conditions and others who were not in a previously healthy state) since Oct 7th.

With such an obvious discrepancy between the IPC's projected deaths and actual deaths due to starvation we can conclude that the estimates provided by the IPC (which are uncritically parroted by almost every mainstream media outlet, the UN, and various human rights organizations) do not accurately reflect the facts on the ground and even the most recent projection published a few days ago overestimates the expected starvation deaths by an extreme degree.

**How did the IPC come to such a conclusion considering the lack of evidence supporting it?**

For this I suggest reading a [report](https://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_Famine_Review_Committee_Report_Gaza_June2024.pdf) published by the Famine Review Committee in June which found that there was no evidence to support the analysis provided by the IPC or famine in general:

>Following the publication of the second FRC report on 18 March 2024, which projected that a Famine would occur in the most likely scenario, a number of important developments occurred. In contrast with the assumptions made for the projection period (March ‚Äì July 2024), the amount of food and non-food commodities allowed into the northern governorates increased. Additionally, the response in the nutrition, water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and health sectors was scaled up. In this context, **the available evidence does not indicate that Famine is currently occurring**.

A [similar report](https://www.gov.il/en/pages/the-third-ipc-report-on-gaza-june-2024-3-sep-2024) also reviewed what details were ignored by the IPC resulting in incorrect food insecurity classifications:

>The accumulation of unique and problematic practices in the IPC reports on Gaza since December 2023 point to a systemic failure by the FRC to ensure compliance with the most basic IPC standards and principles when it comes to this situation.

>

>The expressly biased descriptions of events, coupled with the lack of transparency throughout the process ‚Äì from the identity of the organizations in the Analysis Team, through the details of the ""non-TWG analysis process,"" to the extensive reliance on sources that are factually or methodologically flawed ‚Äì raises serious doubts regarding the neutrality and impartiality of the IPC reports on Gaza, and hence on their credibility.

>

>Hamas' October 7th atrocities, including the taking of over 200 hostages, and its use of civilians as human shields at an unprecedented scale are the cause of the large-scale destruction in Gaza and the serious hardship suffered by its population. Addressing the food security crisis which ensued is a complicated challenge which requires, first and foremost, a reliable and accurate analysis. Sadly, after three reports, it is clear by now that the IPC has been providing a highly misleading picture of reality and projections which are divorced from the actual trends on the ground.

>

>The pattern emerging raises concern that at least some of the organizations involved in the IPC have instrumentalized the analysis process for their campaign to force Israel into an unconditional ceasefire, without the release of its hostages or the removal of Hamas' genocidal threat. Some IPC partner organizations have also been lobbying openly for a weapons embargo on Israel and Hamas (but focusing only on countries supplying them to Israel)  and for other legal measures against Israel, including the issuing of arrest warrants by the ICC. The skewed IPC reports on Gaza thus became the primary ""evidence"" for the libel that Israel has a policy of intentionally starving Gaza's population, making it appear as a plausible accusation in the public, political and academic discourses, as well as in the highest institutions of international law. That is not robust humanitarian advocacy, but a dangerous and irresponsible, even if unintentional, fueling of hate.

**This brings us to the most important question for you to ask yourselves, was this malice or stupidity and if it was the former why is the IPC intentionally lying about the situation in Gaza?**

1g6zw1g,War vs Genocide,2024-10-19 03:13:52,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g6zw1g/war_vs_genocide/,"I realized tonight that, over a year of hearing throngs on the web call Israel's actions in Gaza a ""genocide,"" I've never seen anyone produce a comparison like the one below:

Motivation:  In war, the goal is to weaken or destroy an enemy, while in genocide, the goal is deliberate and systematic destruction of a group of people because of their ethnicity, nationality, religion, or race.

>Israel Goal - war  
Hamas Goal - genocide  
Notes: Israel's goals of the war in Gaza as defined by the cabinet are the destruction of Hamas‚Äôs military and governing infrastructure and the release of the hostages.

Target: In war, the targets are defined by what they do, while in genocide, the victims are defined by who they are.

>Israel Goal - war  
Hamas Goal - genocide  
Notes: Israel targets militants in Gaza who support violence against Israelis. It's clear that they target militants because otherwise the death toll would have been 5 million on October 8th, 2023.

One-sidedness: Genocide is often waged by one group against another, while in war, both sides are armed.

>Israel Goal - war  
Hamas Goal - separate Israeli Jews from diaspora and democratic allies, have international community impose ceasefire so they rebuild and attack again - genocide (or ethnic cleansing)  
Notes: While the death toll is lopsided (a disputed 42,409 Palestinians vs 1,706 Israelis), it is not one-sided. While Al Jazeera English and Middle East Eye portray a conflict in which only civilians suffer, Palestinian media and Al Jazeera Arabic show militants ""heroically"" fighting.

Scale: Some wars have death tolls larger than some genocides and vice versa. For example, roughly 700,000 people died in the Armenian genocide compared to roughly 600,000 in the ongoing Syrian war.

>Hamas is incentivized to exagerate the civilian death toll, and they have done so repeatedly in past conflicts. However, even with their disputed death toll, as of this writing, all conflicts involving Israel and Palestine over the past 100 years have resulted in fewer than 80,000 deaths. Another way to look at it, more people have died in Sudan over the past year (150,000) than in all Israeli-Palestinian conflicts over the past 100 years.  
Some have claimed that the death toll in Gaza is 100,000 or more due to an alleged famine. However, as of this writing, Hamas have reported only 36 deaths attributed to famine. One might argue that this is because medical infrastructure is too decimated to count the dead. However, Hamas continue to add deaths to the official total. Can they only count bombing deaths but not famine deaths"

1g6ycwz,Republican vs Democrat on Palestine-Israel Conflict,2024-10-19 01:46:59,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g6ycwz/republican_vs_democrat_on_palestineisrael_conflict/,"I think it‚Äôs interesting that Republican voters are predominantly Pro-Israel, while Democrat voters are split. Regardless, Pro-Palestine beliefs are far more prevalent among Democrat voters in comparison to Republican voters. Why are Democrats so split on the subject? 

It is of my belief that the Palestine-Israel conflict stems from Great Britain‚Äôs mishandling of Ottoman Palestine. Great Britain‚Äôs promises made to the Palestinian people, as we can see today, were false. I‚Äôm not interested in discussing whether Israel or Palestine is in the right. One thing that is certain is that Great Britain failed miserably, and that Palestinian people deserve sympathy for being deceived. If you want to learn more about this, you can research the San Remo conference.

I think that Democratic voters are more educated on the subject, and thus are more split. I think majority of Republican voters don‚Äôt care much for the subject, and so support Israel by default. 

Despite being split as a voter base, the Democratic Party still heavily supports Israel. Interesting that the party does not act in the interests of it‚Äôs voters. I think this is because, while Republican voters are more Pro-Israel than Democratic voters, KamalaBiden and co are secretly more Pro-Israel than Donald Trump. Let me elaborate. 

Firstly, when Trump and Biden debated the subject, Trump was slaughtered in the media. I‚Äôll summarize the discussion. Biden essentially says that the war can‚Äôt stop until Hamas stops. Trump says the ones who won‚Äôt stop are Israel. He then said Biden is like a weak Palestinian, he won‚Äôt finish the job. This was a really controversial statement, and Trump was called racist. But let‚Äôs look into the context. What is a weak Palestinian? A weak Palestinian is one that doesn‚Äôt fight for what they believe in. Trump was criticizing Biden, who is clearly Pro-Israel and a progenitor of war, for dragging out the war. Rather than blaming Hamas, he acknowledged Israel‚Äôs contribution to the conflict, and shows sympathy to those who are suffering and continue to suffer.

The most plausible explanation for this is that the Democratic Party has greater Jewish funding at the core. Maybe it is because Donald Trump, who is a billionaire, does not require as much funding from Jewish people.

I just found it interesting to contrast beliefs of voters and the leaders of their respective party. 

Dem Voters (Split) -> Biden (Pro-i)
Rep Voters (Pro-i) -> Trump (Pro-i)

Hope somebody else finds this interesting. What are your thoughts? "

Also, when someone says they hate Israel, do they mean they dislike the government and the conflict, or do they also have negative feelings towards Israeli people? And when celebrities show support for Palestine, are they just trying to raise awareness about the situation, or do they genuinely support Palestine and express dislike for Israel?"

Isn't Zionism designed to help them? Why do they feel safe and free have amazing platforms and a ton of Muslim followers and oppose Zionism?

A lot of these people actually report going into Gaza and the West Bank and having Palestinian friends. Why didn't the radical imaginary islamist forces hurt them? 

A lot of these people have written books that debunk the revisionist history of people like Benny Morris. How can Zionist today still feel they have a leg to stand on when such clear proof exists if the tyrannical nature of the colonial ethnostate they have created?

Lastly and this is perhaps the most important thing in my mind. 

If we forget about all the details and go back to the base value set, equality and freedom a good value? For the millions of Palestinians who have been expelled from Palestine wouldn't allowing them back in and giving them a voice and equal rights make the world a better place? 

What are the core values of Zionism? 
How do those core values justify murdering tens of thousands of children?"

Don't fire rockets if you don't want to be bombed and civilians shouldn't suffer the consequences of there governments actions.

One thing that does baffle me is the extreme defense by alot of people who claim to be progressive/left of theocratic countries with a majority Muslim population that are the most far-right you could possibly get in The West times 1000. 

Specifically Iran and Gaza, where people love to claim ""there are christians and many different cultures"" but are actually >99% Muslim. 

These countries have horrible track records on women's and LGBTQ+ rights. Iran has the death penalty for homosexuality in law, in Gaza people have been murdered by the government solely on suspicion for being gay. Women have been stoned in public for adultery, having sex before marriage, and recently The Taliban has brought back their policy of public stonings and have banned women from pretty much every aspect of public life. 

When the U.S. withdrew, thousands of people tried to flee fearing the laws they knew The Taliban would reenact. Even in Syria, which is one of the lesser extreme Muslim Majority countries, millions fled and most refust to return even with peace now in everywhere but Idlib. 

How come they defend these countries and cheer them on which have tyrannical governments that acts against the interests of its civilians and violently suppress anyone who disagrees? 

""Don't bomb civilians"" yes. But how can you encourage these governments to not only exist but expand? If Israel ceased to exist do these people think all of the sudden that these countries would become human rights meccas and life for oppressed civilians would become instantly great? There view seems very short sighted with a lack of ability for any criticism for the vast amount of human rights issues that occur in pretty much every Muslim majority country. Wouldn't it be better for the world, the citizens in these countries, and human rights progression if these governments ceased to exist? 

Dislike Israel all you want, but I find it crazy the lack of accountability for the bad track record of human rights in these countries from a lot of progressives and almost an implication that they're good on these issues especially when most believe that in there own countries people with similar views to Islamist theocracies should be silenced and removed at all costs.

Oct 18 2024: The Sun published a full interview with Fawziya, the Yazidi woman who was sold by ISIS to a Hamas member.

https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/31056306/isis-sex-slave-kidnapped-fed-babies-hamas-gaza/

Update: another source and coverage from Jonathan Spyer at: https://jonathanspyer.com/2024/10/18/in-the-heart-of-darkness/
(Thanks to Apex-I)

Update: YouTube version is now also available at: https://youtu.be/Y_NK4KW5FDU?si=g0S1ddBzreI8ZnQB

The interview sheds some light on several unknowns/assumptions/speculations people have had since the story was first published. It also provides some unexpected information.

The first question everybody was asking: when did she get pregnant and by whom? She had her two children by the time she was 15. Her ""owner"" was a 24 year-old Palestinian. He drugged and raped her - that's how she got pregnant. He was later imprisoned in Syria and she went to Gaza to live with her owner's family (without her children), who locked her in their house and regularly beat her, including the women. When she tried to go out, Hamas would prevent it at gunpoint. She did NOT marry her owner's brother as some rumors claimed.

The second question: who got her out and how? A special IDF operation, coordinated with field agents, Israel government, Iraqi government and the US. The entire event had been triggered by her ability to contact the outside world, which reached a Yazidi activist, who contacted Alan Duncan (also the article's author) who has already conducted similar operations. Secretly, a vehicle transported her to Israel, tracked by IDF drones. From there, she was handed over to Jordan's Iraqi consulate, to get her on her way home to her family in Iraq. Secrecy was key, her communication with IDF mustn't have been exposed, or else she would have been killed

Now, here are some details she shared which I personally didn't think about asking:

She was used as a slave in a Gaza hospital. She said:

>All hospitals were being used as Hamas bases. They all had weapons, everyone had weapons everywhere""

Regarding the comparison between Hamas and ISIS, and regarding claims Hamas had made, about her not being held against her will, she had this to say:

>What Hamas says is wrong, it is an absolute lie. I was never free, I was forced to stay in the house. When I was in Israel and I knew there was no Hamas anymore and I was free, I was very happy. I could breathe again. They were very bad, they forced us, they killed people, they forced me to be there. Why would I be there until now if I wasn't forced to. These people who say it's not true, it's lies, that these things never happened to me, they should have been there instead of me, in my place, then they could talk about that. There is no difference between Hamas and ISIS.

While under ISIS control, there is a sickening description of how they were fed beheaded baby flesh. I'll let you read this one on your own.

I hope this sheds some light about previous assumptions made.

1g6h0c5,Debunking the ‚ÄúThree Oaths‚Äù Argument Against Israel,2024-10-18 12:36:22,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g6h0c5/debunking_the_three_oaths_argument_against_israel/,"There are many anti-Israel voices that use the ‚ÄúThree Oaths‚Äù mentioned in the Talmud as a reason why Jews supposedly shouldn‚Äôt be in Israel today. They argue that Jews are betraying these oaths and that Israel shouldn‚Äôt exist because of them. But this argument is misleading and ignores the actual context of Jewish history and the creation of the State of Israel.

First, let me explain what the ‚ÄúThree Oaths‚Äù are. According to the Talmud, after the destruction of the Second Temple and the beginning of exile, the Jewish people were bound by three oaths:

	1.	Jews should not ‚Äúascend [to the Land of Israel] as a wall,‚Äù meaning by force.
	2.	Jews should not rebel against the nations.
	3.	The nations should not oppress Israel too much.

Some anti-Israel individuals claim that by re-establishing the State of Israel, Jews are violating these oaths, particularly the first one about not returning to the land by force. However, this interpretation is not accurate for a few key reasons:

	1.	The Return to Israel Was Not by Force: The modern return to Israel happened gradually, through immigration and political negotiations‚Äînot through military conquest. The Jewish population increased over time, and the United Nations presented a plan in 1947 that offered both Jews and Palestinians a state. Despite the UN offering Jews a smaller portion of land, we accepted the plan in good faith, while many Arab states rejected it. The creation of Israel was endorsed by international law, not by force.
	2.	We Fought in Defense, Not Conquest: After the UN proposed the partition plan, it was the surrounding Arab nations who attacked Israel, leading to the 1948 War of Independence. Israel had to defend itself, and through that defense, we maintained our state. It wasn‚Äôt that we went to war to conquer the land‚Äîit was about survival and self-defense.
	3.	The Context of the Oaths: Many Jewish scholars argue that the Three Oaths were specific to the time of exile and were never meant to be binding forever. Additionally, the third oath is often overlooked: the nations should not oppress Israel excessively. Given the atrocities of the Holocaust, it‚Äôs hard to argue that the world upheld this part of the oaths, which further undermines the argument.

The modern State of Israel came into existence through legal international agreements, not by breaking the Three Oaths. The claim that Israel‚Äôs existence violates Jewish law is a distortion of history and Jewish teachings. The truth is, Israel was established through diplomacy, and the wars we fought were to defend ourselves, not to take land by force."
1g6gp8d,Sometimes I just want to get away from it all.,2024-10-18 12:20:08,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g6gp8d/sometimes_i_just_want_to_get_away_from_it_all/,"Hello folks, Israeli speaking. I live near the West Bank but technically not in it, so I wouldn't consider myself a settler, both culturely/religiously (I'm very non religious) and also I moved to my current residence w/ my family 15 years ago when I was a kid.


Long story short, I genuinely feel like this conflict is like an actual ""bug"" of the human race as a whole. Every conflict that I can think about feels solvable eventually, *except* this one. There's just too much bloodshed. Too much hatred. Too much racism. Too much xenophobia. Too much sensitinity and emotion .Too many people who actively WANT one side to win and triumph while the other side burns in hell. Kinda like an ""everyone's right but also everyone's wrong"" sort of deal.


What do I think? We'll I'll start first with the elephant in the room: the big G-word.  I genuinely don't know if there is an actual Palestinian Genocide. I REALLY don't want it to be true, if there is a one. That basically means that many if my friends, family, even myself technically (bc I served in the IDF though nowhere near a combat position so I didn't really actively kill/hurt anyone) has taken a part in a genocide. I know my family and the general Israeli culture obviously since I was born, and while there's a lot (imo) wrong with it, I genuinely do not think ""preaching for genocide"" was a part of my education system. Especially with the Holocaust as a huge reason why Israel was founded in the first place. Keep in mind I grew up in a specific area in Israel, and other people may have had different lifestyles and education than me. The Israeli culture is VERY diverse and different based on where you grew up. 

But then again, I am watching some videos about crimes against Palestinians, and they seem *very* convincing. It genuinely looks like Israeli cruelty to me. Now I have seen some instances of Palestinian faking some of these vids, but like, there's no way that ALL of these videos are fake, right? Part of me really does start to believe that a lot of Israelis were slightly brainwashed to believe that we are 100% the good guys and can do no wrong. While the Palestinians are complete evil. Speaking of which...


Now I'll talk about my feelings about the Palestinians, and other Israeli Arabs in general. I've seen MANY videos showing this insane, harsh Palestinian education about Israelis (and Jews as a whole) being the devil, how they should be eradicated, etc, etc'. Like the Israeli cruelty vids, these also seem very convincing. Are Palestinians really that radical? What's the point in clamouring for peace with one side, or even both this hell-bent of destruction and death of its opposition? I don't really know *any* Palestinians personally unfortunately, and I would really like to. I do know some Arabs though. My personal feelings with mostly Muslim Arabs around here is fear, since I am afraid of an Arab suddenly jumping around with a knife trying to kill me. Imo this is the major reason to racism here against Arabs as a whole. Though it's obviously not as simple as that. I do treat any Arab I meet with general respect I have with any other human, and I'd personally take the risk of treating a dangerous Arab with respect rather than be outwardly hateful and cautious towards *all* Arabs, even those who don't deserve it.


The biggest reason that this conflict keeps on, is ofc, the actual death and bloodshed of it all. Antisemetism, Islamophobia, general hatred and verbal arguments suck, but they're not what making the Israel-Palestine situation the impossible conflict that it is. It's the actual blood shed all across these two nations. In Israel, Many people do genuinely feel like victims. From the Israeli side, too many people died by the hands of guilty Palestinians in order to even care about innocent ones. With many videos showing seemingly innocent Palestinians working hand in hand with guilty ones to kill and/or kidnap Israelis, it's the main reasons why many Israelis that I personally know and love, who I know are capable of love and acceptance, are genuinely either indifferent about the Palestinians or straight up want them all gone, or dead. Same with the other way around. So many Israelis bombed Palestinian civillians, with a death count that, let's admit it, is much higher than the Israeli one. Obviously if so many innocent kids are dying to Israelis, then Palestinians would look at all Israelis as the devil incarnate. It sucks. It shouldn't be this way. Yet what can I do about it? What can we do about it as a whole?


I truly want to live in a hypothetical world where both Israelis and Palestinians, Jews and Arabs, live hand in hand with true peace and love, but the amount of bloodshed, hatred both from within and outside, and too many people who want true war rather than peace, just makes it seem impossible to solve. I haven't mustered up the courage yet to advocate for peace on both sides publicly in front of everyone I know, but damn it I want to. It will probably make 90% of my surrounding people hate me though, and I am VERY sensitive to being hated. It's the one thing that gives me stress the most, not bc of the conflict but for personal psychological reasons. Maybe I'm stupid for advocating for this impossible peace and co-existence, but part of me would rather die stupid, and hated, advocating for peace than live safe and sound, advocating for war. Or maybe I have this all wrong. Idk."
1g6g7jg,Analysing the true palastinian interest,2024-10-18 11:53:10,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g6g7jg/analysing_the_true_palastinian_interest/,"The bigest question among neutral politicians today which aim to join the efforts of commiting peace in the middle east is ""what the palastinians want?"". this question remained an enigma since the days of Yasser Arafat, during the 90' era, they had the most perfect conditions for true peace. And despite all this, the man just abandoned everything in what looked like a manic attack and organized a new Intifada. The man didn't even bothered to explain the world why. The overwhelmed Israeli left wing thought that ""this man probably wants somthing and he tries to imply his dissatisfaction about something in the final agreement in his unique way"", but no, Arafat actually didn't look like someone that wants something reassoable. So as the years passed by without any coharent palastinian clarification, Israel concluded that the palastinians don't really want a state or neighbourship since they've fell in love with some global fundamental muslim ideas about ""the great victory of the islamic revolution over the infidels"". They fell in love with playing a significant role that brings attention and glory from those who had despised them during the history of the region. They fell in love with being a part of something that provides recognition and gratitude after being considered second class arabs for so many years. They fell in love with being a symbol of a legendary culture - religion war which is a beloved myth in the muslim universe and the main reason of the muslim literacy stagnation which started at the medival era. And in the nowadays, we can also see those ideas expanding to the US and europe while they exclusively ride on the palastinian flag as an implicit symbol to the true goal. 

I don't know whether I'm allowed to share video link here, but in this video you can clearly see how my claims strictly expressed in the ""palastinian movement""s actions in the US. Those people don't seem like anyone that wants a state or libarty. They simply express their will to commit cultural - religional hegemony to feed their etnocentric ego and earn dubious glory. And this exactly how Israel refers to any single of their claims. In the eyes of the Israelis, this is exactly what they want.

1g6fi5c,Netanyahu's UN Map of Israel Tells You Everything You Need to Know!,2024-10-18 11:11:21,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g6fi5c/netanyahus_un_map_of_israel_tells_you_everything/,"When Netanyahu gave his speech at the UN, the map of Israel that he showed included Gaza, East Jerusalem and the West Bank all part of Israel. This was also not the first time he has shown that map of the Palestinian as part of Israel.

The problem is that Likud and Netanyahu know that while they want those territories to be part of the Jewish state, they cannot integrate the Palestinians living in those territories. The population of Israel is 9.3 million with 20% of Palestinian heritage. There are 5.5 million Palestinians in the Palestinian territories. So, if Israel gave the Palestinians in the territories Israeli citizenship, the make up of the country would be roughly equal number of Jews and Palestinians. So, the Palestinians can win elections and dominate the country, which Likud and Netanyahu could never accept. And this is not accounting for the of Palestinian refugees in the neighboring countries who want to come back to historic Palestine.

So, how can you take over the land without integrating the population there? Expel them! The problem is that this is modern times and there is supposed to be international laws that you cannot simply expel people as you want. So, how do you go about it? Make their lives as unbearable as possible so that they would want to emigrate. 700,000 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, make sure Gaza and the WB are economically deprived. Make sure Palestinian daily lives are as hard as possible.

And if you look at the future through the prism of Israel incorporating the Palestinian territories into Israel, but without the Palestinians, then one can see the Gaza situatin differently. NYTimes already reported that Israel had up to a one year warning that Hamas was planning Oct. 7th. They were warned again a month in advance. They also dismissed the warnings of the female IDF soldiers who were posted at the border of Gaza who reported for days of a lot of activity by Hamas. Netanyahu's government, including it's far right zionists who openly talk about the Palestinian territories belonging to Israel, also moved the IDF units near Gaza and moved them elsewhere just before Oct. 7th. Those facts and the subsequent actions of Israel lend to the real possibility that the Netanyahu gov't knew Oct. 7th was going to happen and purposely let it happen.

Almost the first thing Netanyahu wanted to do is move Gazans into the Sinai to supposedly go after Hamas without the Palestinian civilians getting in the way. Egypt, Biden, Arab and European countries immediately told him no, as his plan was apparent. This was not going to be a temporary exodus. Israel would have found every excuse to keep the Palestinians out. So, not being allowed to kick the Palestinians out, they have destoryed all of Gaza and made sure life is not only going to be unbearable for them now, but that it will be unbearable for them for years to come. Use Oct. 7th for more settlements in the WB, more excuses to harrass Palestinians there. And Gaza unlivable so they will want out too.

For people like Netanyahu and his far right wing coalition, Oct. 7th was a small price to pay for finally getting rid of the Palestinians, and integrating their lands into Israel. Gaza's depopulation and take over was supposed to be immediate, but was stopped by Egypt and the world. The WB more of a long term plan."
1g6et4r,Sinwar‚Äôs last moments,2024-10-18 10:25:48,87,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g6et4r/sinwars_last_moments/,"Israel supporter here. Many of you have undoubtedly seen the footage of a weakened Sinwar sitting in an armchair hurling a stick at an Israeli drone moments before a tank shell took his life. I‚Äôve seen posts praising this as a final act of defiance. I see it differently. I believe it highlights the difference between the Palestinian mentality and that of the Israelis.

In their last moments of freedom before being dragged to Gaza, the hostages were - after dancing at a music festival for peace - crying, pleading for their lives, or cowering in bomb shelters. These people wanted nothing more than to go on living. They had no hate in their hearts.

Sinwar was the leader of Hamas, the leader of the Palestinian people. How he chose to spent his last breath was emblematic of what he taught a generation of his followers. Rather than look towards peace, he fights to the death. Rather than live as a Gandhi, or a Martin Luther King, or even a Yizhak Rabin or Anwar Sadat, he chose Ahab or Khan - with his last breath he spits at thee. This is their role model, and I do not find it inspiring. 

Nations are often made through revolutions, but only when the passion for that nation outweighs the hate for its oppressor. In Sinwar‚Äôs last breath he showed that his mission was more about hate than love, war not peace. It‚Äôs not a legendary revolutionary action to be praised, but a hateful act to be pitied. I‚Äôm sad for the life he taught the Palestinians to lead.

Let his life be the last one the Palestinians look to for this kind of leadership. May they find their MLK, their Gandhi to guide them to freedom, and through that, give Israel the peace and rest it deserves. "
1g6ax4i,Zionists: give your biggest criticism of Israel. Pro-Palestinian please give your biggest critique of your side‚Äôs movement.,2024-10-18 05:31:29,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g6ax4i/zionists_give_your_biggest_criticism_of_israel/,"
First I wanna address the pro Palestinian to which I'm pretty sure I align more with:
What things has the pro-Palestinian movement has done that you have an issue with?
For me I think cliche as it sounds there has been an exaggeration on how irresponsible or malicious Israel has been in conducting its war in Gaza.
There's been no mass starvation events(thankfully), and the deaths have plateaued months ago.

I say this especially is detrimental if Israel does start to become worse and it can be a lot worse.

What is the biggest criticism you have of the movement?


Now to Zionists:
Often times accusations of anti-Semitism are given to critism of Israel. Some imo are warranted. Ex. Complaining AIPac got us into Iraq. That I find to be anti-Semitic. Israel doesn't push progressive thought in the US to weaken us. That's also anti-Semitic. 

I as an anti-Zionist can say some criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic and condemn it as such. 

Other critism a  are not imo--such as not being gung ho about the settlements in West Bank is being anti-Semitic. 

I find settlements to be increasing the difficulty to any attempt at a two state solution and I find the notion of a one state solution something that'll just end in de jure apartheid or ethnic cleansing.

I'd like to hear some legitimate criticisms of the state Israel that you don't think is anti-Semitic. Key word--state. Not just a particular political faction or figure you dislike.

I‚Äôm a gulf arab so Ive been spared the worst of our regions tumultuous recent history, but i do understand arabs and i pity those of you who think that peace can be achieved with wars (specially one that was this brutal on the civilian population). there is nothing more important to an arab than honor and pride, and Israel with its recent actions which ranged from disrespectful such as smashing up stores in Gaza and wearing the women‚Äôs lingerie‚Äôs and underwear to actual war crimes like the sde teiman incident have convinced me that Israel has been fighting them for decades without understanding what their enemy is fighting for. The reactions to Oct 7 and the celebrations of such brutality left no doubt In my mind, they‚Äôre not fighting to erase Israel they‚Äôre not even fighting to get a state they‚Äôre fighting to restore their honor they knew Hamas stood no chance at the end of the day and would eventually be kicked out of Israeli territories it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs been so long that they had the upper hand for a little while. And without having much to live for as Palestine is an under developed mess (yes i know they had funding and all it just goes back to that honor and pride above all thing) and with this constant reminder of Israeli acts of humiliation they‚Äôll always fight until that honor and pride is restored. As to what Israel can do to restore said honor is where things get funny and above my pay grade to be honest. Now this not gonna fix everything as some genuinely fight to destroy israel as entity and some do just want a state and are willing to forget but i do believe that honor and pride is above all. "
1g67mcq,"Help me understand the ""no innocent settlers"" concept justifying 10/7/23 in light of how Israeli civilians got there in the first place.",2024-10-18 02:13:16,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g67mcq/help_me_understand_the_no_innocent_settlers/,"My POV: I am an American Ashkenazi Jew descended from Holocaust survivors. I see what is happening in Gaza as a genocide. To be clear, my position is ultimately that regardless of origin or semantics, this level of civilian death is indefensible and can't be allowed to continue. Simultaneously, it's difficult for me to get involved with some activist groups because some seem to be very explicitly antisemitic. I see a lot of literal Holocaust denial, claims that Jews secretly control the US, celebration of Hitler and known historical antisemites/Nazis/Nazi sympathizers, etc. I do not believe this qualifies as ""punching up"" (as leftists in the West have generally decided is okay- which I generally agree with) because Jews as an ethnic group are not the ""oppressor class"" in any context except for this specific one maybe, and I am honestly not educated about the details regarding that dynamic (i.e., what about Arab Jews, etc).

I am genuinely open minded and could really be swayed either way by more concrete information, but because of the urgency and devastation of what's going on right this second, it's very difficult to get someone to talk about these points without it being interpreted as a justification of the brutality and violence.

So here is the thing:

One particular issue that makes me uncomfortable is the way 10/7/23 is now being discussed as a completely righteous and reasonable uprising against oppressors, with the rationale that there are ""no innocent settlers.""

I understand this rests on the premises: 1) The ""settler"" thing implies settler colonialism, which is morally inexcusable under any circumstances; 2) any Jews in Israel are the ""settlers"" in question here; and 3) being ""not innocent"" means that the appropriate penalty is being killed at any given time. 

I have to suspect there are several oversimplifications here. I don't want to believe that celebration of 10/7 is literally just people being happy because they hate Jews and think any of them should die as some kind of revenge for Palestinian displacement and/or political oppression. But I honestly don't think people would be acting this way if Native Americans decided to do a 9/11 tomorrow, and I would like some people who have a more nuanced understanding to point me in the direction of what I need to research and understand. Right now, the ""vibe"" I get is that Israeli Jews are seen as the ""white ones"" in the sense that they are inherently oppressive and deserve whatever comes to them; but also not so white that Americans can sympathize with being born into their present society and not being directly responsible for the state of affairs or having the means to go, like, anywhere else. 

My main questions concern the idea that all Jews in the region are ""settlers"" in the sense of ""land-stealers"" rather than ""immigrant refugees."" For one, aren't more than half of Jews in Israel the children of the Jews who were forcibly expelled from Arab nations right after WWII? (I can understand the argument that this is ""Israel's fault"" in theory, but clearly not the fault of the people immigrating.) And aren't a lot of the ""white Jews"" (the 20-ish% Ashkenazi population) refugees from the Holocaust who settled in Israel years before countries like the US would even take them, when there were virtually no options if they'd lost their homes in Europe? And while 5% isn't huge, isn't that a relatively significant number of Jews who have just always been there- like, big enough that if you just start killing civilians indiscriminately, you're likely to encounter them? Is there any argument that they are ""settlers""?

To be even more specific, according to this argument, what specifically did all the Jews killed on 10/7 do wrong? Not apply for visas to immigrate to, like, Germany or something as soon as they turned 18? I am not trying to be snarky and I am most interested in hearing the opinions of those who are more ""anti-Zionist"" because I don't want to create an echo chamber. I am honestly asking, not trying to make an argument."

I've been researching the Israel and Palestine conflict for a  while now but all of my sources have been in support of Israel. I am someone who likes to see both sides and by only getting information from one side I'm missing a whole different section of information. People only paint Israel in the best light so it makes sense that they would leave out possibly incriminating things.  I just want to know why people believe there is a genocide going on in Palestine, or even just what's going on in Palestine is a whole.  My thinking is that if such a large group of people believe something to the extent that's been shown there's no way they haven't seen any legitimate sources right? 

I'm of the belief that information from Hamas can't be trusted whatsoever cause at the end of the day they are a terrorist organization. Obviously people aren't getting all their info from Hamas (I don't think) so knowing where is really important to me. I don't think I'll ever be able to fully grasp what's going on if I can't see some first hand sources.

I think it's also my fault that I haven't found good sources cause the thing is my dad's Israeli and a family friend of his has been taken hostage so obviously I do have a little bias. I really just want everyone to be okay and I don't want to hurt anyone in my family doing so.

I'm not trying to be disrespectful to either side I just genuinely want to know more about whats going on in Palestine with actual proof and such. (please be respectful)"

Put in the consideration that me and a lot of people from these countries which  didn't use to speak Arabic or to be a Muslim country in the past are not considered to be natives to our land because some people on this planet thinking that Arabic or converting to Islam changed our DNA (and by the way my country is a part of the so-called greater Israel as some people claim) .....

First I will play the oppressed and I will talk to you and I will say why are you blaming me for being the oppressed there's some brutal arab Muslims who came to my land and forced me to convert to the religion and to speak Arabic so what are you blaming me 1400 years later .... Second I will be the invader I will be one of these brutal Arab Muslims who are forcing the natives to speak Arabic and convert to Islam doesn't that make us even if you are doing the same thing to the Palestinians ??.....

Israel is also the only country in the Middle East that won't outright kill people for being gay and treats women as people. Israel actually falling means a good 80% of the people on this platform would likely be killed or jailed for being who they are in the country they are supporting. Is there any way that Israel and Palestine manage to work this out without destroying each other? We know Hamas is the primary fighting force behind this conflict for the Palestinians and are very open about their desire for the annihilation of Israel. Hamas official, Hamad Al-Regeb in an April 2023 sermon: He prayed for ‚Äúannihilation‚Äù and ‚Äúparalysis‚Äù of the Jews whom he described as filthy animals.

>During IDF operations in Gaza, 3 terrorists were eliminated. The IDF and ISA are checking the possibility that one of the terrorists was Yahya Sinwar. At this stage, the identity of the terrorists cannot be confirmed.

>In the building where the terrorists were eliminated, there were no signs of the presence of hostages in the area. The forces that are operating in the area are continuing to operate with the required caution.

Images of the body have been circulating online and it appears as though the IDF have physical access to it. It will likely be transferred to Israel for DNA testing before an official confirmation is made.

As for the images themselves, the body is wearing a tactical vest and has a striking resemblance to Sinwar. There are various images comparing facial features such as a mole on his left eye and the spacing of his teeth which similarly seem to match up. I will not be posting images of the body itself but they are not difficult to find online.

I'll continue updating this thread as more information is released.

* Reports of large sums of money and fake IDs found at site.
* Initial DNA tests are positive. Still waiting on official confirmation.
* Reports that Hamas members were identified in a building and were fired upon by a tank. It was only after troops entered to confirm the kill that Sinwar was discovered to be among them.
* Israeli officials confirm Sinwar‚Äôs elimination.
* Body will likely be used in a future hostage exchange.
* Sinwar killed while hiding in civilian house in Rafah. ([Geolocation](https://x.com/JakeGodin/status/1846980347780911499))

# The Facts

* The New York Times on Tuesday defended a piece it published last week alleging that there were multiple cases of Israeli forces in Gaza shooting children in their head or chest. The article, filed as an opinion piece, was based on the testimony of 65 US-based health professionals who had worked in Gaza over the past year.[\[1\]](https://www.nytco.com/press/response-to-recent-criticisms-on-new-york-times-opinion-essay/)[\[2\]](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/09/opinion/gaza-doctor-interviews.html)
* Critics said the accounts were inaccurate or fabricated, but the Times claimed to have ""rigorously edited this guest essay before publication"" and worked to verify its claims. The outlet added that its editors had seen photos too graphic to publish corroborating the claims.[\[1\]](https://www.nytco.com/press/response-to-recent-criticisms-on-new-york-times-opinion-essay/)[\[3\]](https://www.mediaite.com/media/new-york-times-rejects-viral-claims-that-story-on-gaza-children-being-shot-in-the-head-is-fabricated/)
* On Sunday, the op-ed's author, trauma surgeon Dr. Feroze Sidhwa, said that there was a misunderstanding regarding the CT scans included in the piece, stating they were ""typical of someone who has been shot in the head but is still alive.""[\[3\]](https://www.mediaite.com/media/new-york-times-rejects-viral-claims-that-story-on-gaza-children-being-shot-in-the-head-is-fabricated/)[\[4\]](https://archive.is/TlUyS)
* The original piece also detailed the psychological trauma on children caused by the war as well as the deaths of babies due to dehydration, malnourishment, and disease. Many of the health professionals spoke of a lack of medical equipment to effectively treat patients.[\[2\]](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/09/opinion/gaza-doctor-interviews.html)
* Israeli bombing and military operations have destroyed large swaths of Gaza's infrastructure, displaced virtually all of the population, and killed more than 41K Palestinians, according to the strip's health ministry. The number of active combatants killed is unclear.[\[5\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02508-0)
* The war in the enclave broke out on the same day as and in retaliation for the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, in which gunmen killed about 1.2K people and took some 250 hostages to Gaza.

# The Spin

# Narrative A

The accusations against this rigorously scrutinized article are completely baseless. Everything that was included in the piece was verified multiple times, including by independent experts, and there are photos substantiating its claims that are simply too graphic to publish.

# Narrative B

The validity of these CT scans must be questioned for several reasons. The lack of skull fragments, exit wounds, or change in the shape of the bullets is evidence that the CT scans were fabricated. Additionally, even if the scans are legitimate, there is no evidence that Israeli forces fired the bullet, as Hamas is known to kill civilians."
1g5luoo,What does the word 'Zionism' mean to you? ,2024-10-17 08:06:09,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g5luoo/what_does_the_word_zionism_mean_to_you/,"What does 'zionism' even mean anymore? It seems to me that this concept - or rather this word - seems to be one of the major points of contention and misunderstanding because it seems to mean very different things depending on who you ask.

Me myself as a British Jew, my grandparents would most certainly call themselves Zionists, to them this simply meant the belief that a Jewish state is a necessity in order to prevent another holocaust (they were of the generation who grew up during and after the holocaust so naturally their outlook was shaped by that). My granddad in particular was a dedicated Zionist and owned Herzl's books though he apparently simply liked living in London too much to ever consider moving to Israel, like other members of his family did.

I would not describe him or most other older Jews who describe themselves as Zionists as hateful people, not even towards Palestinians. Although attacks by Palestinian groups on Israelis and diaspora Jews did upset them very much and they would be angry towards specific groups like Hamas - but I never remember them having any actual hatred towards Palestinians or Muslims themselves and living in London they interacted and talked with Muslims with no problem at all. If they were guilty of anything it was ignorance of the impact that the creation of Israel had had on the Palestinians which I think if they truly understood would probably have a more nuanced view on why the conflict was happening.

I am aware there are people in the Jewish community who are just hateful to Muslims and Palestinians, but I wouldn't count my grandparents as such, in their case their Zionism did not mean being hateful to anyone. They did not seem to be a fan of the more right wing and fanatical form of Zionism which characterises Israeli politics today and thought it was ''a group of stupid people with war fantasies''.

However, when I see the word Zionism used nowadays online or by pro-palestine protesters, Im not sure what they mean when they say it or what they have in mind. Zionism to them seems to mean a form of racism or some sort of Jewish supremacy which implies hatred and a desire to hurt or kill Palestinians or other groups- I don't fault people for thinking this but it doesn't really apply to my grandparents or most other Jewish people I've known who would call themselves 'zionist' and I don't really believe they deserve to be hated.

Sometimes when people use the word 'zionism' it does just confuse me a lot, my main worry concerning this is that people's vague definitions of Zionism are being confused with things which are just ordinary Jewish things like saying ''next year in Jerusalem'' or visiting the Western Wall or even observing Hannukah. To me this is where anti-zionism becomes anti-semitism but I dont think everyone who says such things are doing so out of a genuine hatred of Jews but out of misunderstanding.

So I would just like to ask, what does 'Zionism' mean to you? What is it you are describing when you say 'Zionism' and how would you define it?"
1g5kc8o,Why is there no Zionist thought regarding Tunisia and its connection to ancient Semitic Carthage? ,2024-10-17 06:11:43,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g5kc8o/why_is_there_no_zionist_thought_regarding_tunisia/,"This was something I was thinking about earlier today. Zionism is the belief that Israel has a right to exist in the lands that comprised the ancient Kingdom of Israel, itself descended from even more ancient Canaan, due to the Semitic-speaking peoples that lived there in that time period. However upon thinking about this topic, it dawned on me that I have never seen any similar belief about Tunisia. Tunisia in the ancient period, at least over the first millennium BCE, was the heartland of the Carthaginian civilisation, itself founded and ruled by Semitic-speaking migrants from Phoenicia. Why then has there not been a belief system that an Israel-like state has a right to exist in Tunisia, where ancient Carthage once stood? It seems to be. in my mind at least, a very similar situation - an area that was once owned by an ancient Semitic people was lost over a significant period of time, in both cases principally by Roman imperialism, and now a 'return to the historical homeland' belief and action has taken hold. Yet this doesn't seem to exist in Tunisia, and from what I've read, Tunisia wasn't considered as a candidate for Zionism. Any thoughts about this? 

For the record, I am not pro-Zionist, but I'm also not too interested in getting caught up in anti-Zionist speech here. That's not the point of this topic. This is just something that I was pondering about earlier, and wanted to see what other people thought. Maybe there is a Tunisian Zionist movement that I just haven't heard about? If so, I would be interested in reading about it. I'm surprised that Carthage isn't name dropped more frequently by Zionists though, as that was arguably the most powerful and influential ancient Semitic culture to have ever existed in recorded history. 

As for the naming, such a belief wouldn't really be called 'Zionism' obviously, due to the lack of a Mount Zion in the area. Would it perhaps be called Carthagism or something similar? "

I ask this because from my understanding the land purchases between Jews and Palestinians were often done so without the consultation of the peasant workers, with the distant landowners making the deals. I understand that many of the purchases were legal, but, they seem immoral. I guess what I am ultimately trying to ask, is if there was a way that the Jews could have settled in the land of Israel without displacing Palestinian populations/disrupting their way of life/economy whilst also establishing a Jewish state separate from an Arab/Palestinian one? Which specific faction within Zionism represents these specific ideals, (or is most closely related) and would Palestinians accept such a proposal if this were the original Zionist settlement plan? Which specific areas/parts of the British Mandate of Palestine would fall into the criteria of settlement laid above? If there wasn‚Äôt purely uninhabited land, which way could Zionist settlement have been done in a way that does not displace ANY Palestinians/other natives? If displacement is inevitable, what way could Zionist settlement have been done that displaced the LEAST amount of Palestinians/other natives? Also were there any specific scholars, politicians, or other people that have advocated for something like this during the initial settlement?"

Another group has decided not to endorse either candidate.  I get the second group's point that Biden/Harris have not been able to stop the bloodshed in Gaza. And they continue to support Israel's attacks on Hamas and Hezbollah, even though too many innocent people have died as a result (although to be fair those groups are clearly hiding near civilians as they attack Israel). 

But I see a big difference between Trump and Harris. (1) Trump is squarely in favor of Arab countries making peace with Israel regardless of Israel's actions or willingness to recognize a Palestinian state But Harris will press the Arab countries to hold out for a peace agreement with an independent Palestinian state. (2) Trump will not seriously press Israel to give aid to Gaza and limit their use of deadly force there.. But we know Harris will press Israel as much as possible (3) Trump will give a green light to offensive operations by Israel. Harris will press Israel to limit its military actions to defense of Israel's ability to exist. 

All this in addition to the arguments made by emgage in the article. 

Now I'm someone who supports a two-state solution in Palestine.  Israel has a right to exist securely as a Jewish state, but only in line with UN resolutions.  Neither side has proposed peace in ages.  Israel thinks it can exist securely without peace.  Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas has made it impossible for Palestinians to propose peace.

Enough is enough. The land should be split, allowing both to exist as the state they want, secure from threats. Surely, Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah want peace and prosperity for Palestinians. Surely, Israel wants peace and security, and Arab trade.

A Harris victory would be a step towards peace, security and justice in Palestine. A Trump victory would be a disaster.

1g5d4d7,Is it possible for Israel to cease to exist as a state?,2024-10-16 23:25:26,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g5d4d7/is_it_possible_for_israel_to_cease_to_exist_as_a/,"This is a question which seems to always come up - I've noticed many on the pro-palestine side seem confident if not hopeful that Israel will be destroyed as a state, many seeing it as an inevitability. Those who support Israel will also feel anxiety about a potential violent destruction of Israel - or an Israel which collapses because of its own internal chaos.

The history of the land which now makes up Israel/Palestine is a history of nations and kingdoms rising and falling,  many who controlled this land thought they would be the ones to control it forever - until they didn't. So the feeling of the state of Israel being inevitably prone to destruction is understandable, Israelis themselves seem obsessed with their own destruction.

But personally despite all of this, I'm not sure if it's that easy for Israel to cease to exist. Countries are simply not really that easy to destroy and previous attempts to destroy Israel have failed. Its true it is riveted by very serious and intense political divisions which seem to be only getting worse - but I'm not sure if this necessarily means there will no longer be no state of Israel, just a different one.

Having said this I would not rule out the idea of Israel ceasing to exist as a state completely as history has shown that the previously unthinkable can suddenly just happen - Israel's creation was an example of such a moment and maybe its end will be too

Do you feel like introspective questions like these serve a greater purpose? 

How do you feel about the checkpoints?

1g5bs96,"Pro Israelis : don't complain about Palestinians calling all of Israel ""Palestine"" if you do exactly the same !",2024-10-16 22:21:04,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g5bs96/pro_israelis_dont_complain_about_palestinians/,"Lol I'm sorry but it's so hypocritical it's insane. Anywhere you go if anyone dares to put the entire region from the Jordan to the Mediterranean as ""Palestine"" and maybe showing Arab names of the place, you'll automatically see Israelis and pro Israelis complaining, saying it's ""genocidal"" and ""wanting to wipe Jews off the map!!!""



But the thing is that it's crazy how often the opposite is happening. There's maps of ""Israel"" which include all of the West Bank and Gaza and with no Palestine present, like at all. On magnets, on maps in the classroom, on amulets. Palestine simply doesn't exist there and the map that's shown clearly doesn't respect international law.



It's appearing very often on necklaces and many Jewish artists show the entire former mandate of Palestine as ""Eretz Yisrael""



In fact these people have the audacity to claim that this artwork isn't political and that it's according to ""traditional Jewish beliefs"" and calling this out is antisemitic apparently...



Yesh surely a map including the boundaries exactly of the British mandate of Palestine and the Golan Heights surely doesn't have ANYTHING to do with ancient politics! It's about being ""Indigenous Judeans""... ü•±


And yeah simply ignore the fact that ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judea don't correspond to modern boundaries at all, they don't contain Ashkelon for example, but who cares right? This Zionist artwork surely is purely apolitical, trust me...





And honestly speaking I'm sorry but I see much less of a justification for labeling the West Bank and Gaza Israeli than labeling Israel Palestinian. Many Palestinians can say that they believe it's Palestine because it's where their family came from... Their families lived in Lydda, Haifa, Jaffa, Ramle, and then we're violently expulsed during the Nakba and they're supposed to say that this isn't their land anymore? Meanwhile what excuse do the Israelis have to label an area like Ramallah which was 99% Arab even in 1947 as ""Israeli""? Ah yeah 2000 years ago SOME of your ancestors had this as your land? I'm sorry it's simply ridiculous.




For them all of the land is ""Israel"" simply because the British said that this land belongs to them. Some ""Revisionist Zionists"" said that literally all of modern day Jordan should be Israel as well, even though most of it had literally ZERO Jewish population. Yeah it's definitely about ""indigenous lands"" sure! üòí"
1g5875n,Ex-Israeli view on the current war,2024-10-16 19:45:05,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g5875n/exisraeli_view_on_the_current_war/,"As someone who lived in Israel for nearly 45 years, I want to share my perspective. I left a year ago, just before the war began, knowing it was coming and would be bloody. Israel‚Äôs internal state‚Äîsocially, economically, and politically‚Äîwas already dire.

It felt impossible to live there. The cost of living soared, the government was corrupt, pushing undemocratic laws, and religious populations were growing much faster than secular ones. Distrust was rampant, with people trying to take advantage of each other, even close friends and family. It was like a pyramid, where everyone trampled those below, and at the bottom were the Palestinians. As Israeli society crumbled, it became clear the Palestinians would seize the moment, sparking violence and an inevitable harsh response from Israel.

I left because I couldn‚Äôt be part of this. I don‚Äôt believe in the concept of countries, especially when I feel exploited by a corrupt government uninterested in peace, treating its citizens like cash cows under the guise of ""security.""

I also felt betrayed by the people, though it was hard to pinpoint why. Living in Israel, you're conditioned to believe you‚Äôre the victim, that everyone is out to kill you, and that Jews must stick together. But in reality, Jews don‚Äôt support each other‚Äîmany would gladly stab you in the back.

These are harsh words, but this is my view, shaped by my experiences. I come from a broken family with an abusive father and struggled to find love and trust. Putting my personal experiences aside, it‚Äôs clear now that Israel has become utterly corrupt and violent. It boils down to the fact that Israel is not a democracy.

We can debate whether Israel is committing genocide, if Gaza can be compared to the Holocaust, or whether Israel is an apartheid state. But we cannot deny that Israel is not a democracy‚Äîhalf its population lacks basic human rights, including the right to vote. Allowing them to vote would threaten Israel‚Äôs identity as a Jewish state.

Why doesn‚Äôt anyone talk about this? Israel never intended to occupy Palestinian territories. After the 1967 war, it held onto the land for strategic reasons. When peace talks nearly succeeded in 1997, they crumbled, leading to a wave of terrorism and the complete collapse of trust in the peace process. That set the stage for religious nationalists like Netanyahu to take over, with no interest in preserving democracy. His alliance with the religious far-right, who openly oppose democracy, has been in power ever since.

In short, Israel oppresses half its population and is ruled by a religious-nationalist regime that‚Äôs openly anti-democratic. So if democracy is just a fa√ßade, what is Israel really? To me, it‚Äôs a fanatical religious state, rooted in the belief that God promised this land to the Jews‚Äîa belief that drives the oppression of Palestinians.

This view contrasts sharply with how Israel perceives itself. Israel wasn‚Äôt always like this. It once functioned as a modern state striving for peace. When I was 10 in the 1990s, people believed that by the time I turned 18, there would be peace, and I wouldn‚Äôt have to serve in the army.

But the fundamental mistake was the Jewish return to Israel. It was Hitler‚Äôs greatest victory‚Äîhe succeeded in removing Jews from Europe, and instead of realizing the harm religion had caused, Jews clung to it even more. Zionists, though not initially religious, used religion to unite Jews, which worked‚Äîbut at a cost. The Bible gave religious factions the right to demand its laws be enforced, and now they are the majority in Israel.

Jewish tradition evolved over 2,000 years as a minority, often self-segregating and exploiting their non-Jewish neighbors. Those who assimilated lost their Jewish identity, leaving the most extreme behind. That‚Äôs what we see in Israel now: the religious isolating themselves, avoiding military service, living off government subsidies, and not contributing to the economy‚Äîessentially scamming the rest of the country, just as Jews were accused of doing in Europe.

So what‚Äôs next for Israel? How can a country survive, surrounded by enemies and consumed from within by religious fanatics? People like me, modern and secular, are fleeing. We are the ones who pay taxes, innovate, and serve in the army. When we leave, all that remains is a militant regime in constant conflict with equally militant enemies. The line between Israelis and Palestinians has blurred‚Äîthey are almost the same now. The only difference is that Israel is propped up by the U.S., which sees it as a frontline defense.

I want no part of this madness. I believe the land should be returned to the Palestinians, and the Jews‚Äîespecially those of European descent‚Äîshould return to where they came from. After all, those from Arab countries can stay, as they are essentially Arabs themselves. It‚Äôs harsh, but the fact is, the Arab Jews are the most fanatical supporters of Netanyahu and the war. So as far as concern - Let them fight each other until they're all gone. Isn‚Äôt it what natural selection is all about?

They promised at the end of 2023 that if humanitarian aid ended up with Hamas they would be stopped. In the end Hamas earned 500 million dollars.

They are incapable of putting pressure on Egypt and Qatar. Egypt even wants the Rafah crossing to go back to how it was on October 6th.

Between April and June they forced Israel to accept every bullshit from Hamas. This behavior has in fact led to a policy of killing and mistreatment of American citizens held hostage. The number of living people is not important anyway.

They took away all the pressure cards from Israel.

They forced them to flood Hamas with aid to sell on the market.

While on Al Jazeera the Gaza journalists are obese, Eden Yerushalmi was killed while weighing only 36 kg.

Now about 51 live hostages are in concentration camp conditions, pissing blood but the important thing for Washington is that the terrorists holding them are gorging on fried chicken.

Now Sinwar doesn't even want to release them but hey the  Michigan votes. So zero pressure on him.

1g53e2o,What happens if Israel leaves Gaza right now?,2024-10-16 16:22:12,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g53e2o/what_happens_if_israel_leaves_gaza_right_now/,"If Israel were to pull all military forces out of Gaza, no deal, no negotiation, just getting the troops out of there without killing anyone else, what would happen? What is HAMAS currently capable of? How long might it take for them to regroup for another attack? What would they do in Gaza? What would be the effect on Palestinian people? 


My understanding is that HAMAS is such an integral part of Gazan culture and politics that you basically can't have one without the other. I used to think that it was just a radical pseudo-government militia that took over and was voted in promising to fight for Palestinian statehood, and whose extremist views are not reflective of those of the Palestinian people, but it seems like the hatred of Jews and the opposition to the existence of a Jewish state is so ubiquitous among Palestinians, especially in HAMAS-controlled Gaza, that HAMAS is effectively an unopposed unitary political party that has a monopoly on the hearts and minds of the people. HAMAS didn't create the antisemitism in Gaza, and it didn't even need to do anything to make it worse because they already hate Jews and blame the Jewish people for everything they've been suffering through every since the state was established.


That being said, how do you destroy HAMAS without destroying all of Gaza? How can Israel hope to end the attacks on it by HAMAS without harming the civilians being used as human shields? How can Israel defend itself without a constant offensive in Gaza until the HAMAS threat is eliminated? What else are they expected to do? Should they just pull out and wait for the next attack that kills Jews? Would you expect any other country to do that? 


Let's use an example of a hypothetical in America. If white supremacist groups in the USA were to militarize, take over a significant amount of territory within the borders of the country we established, and secede from the country while declaring a whole ethnic and cultural group of people to be inferior to them, enacting repressive laws, and attacking the territory of the country they believe to represent the reason their people are suffering from their decision to start the conflict in the first place, would it be genocide to kill the people they are using as human shields in order to prevent the threat against the US from growing and taking the lives of American civilians in indiscriminate attacks that have the primary goal of killing the people they feel are inferior to them? 


Oh wait, that already happened, except even the Confederacy didn't do that last part. Even the CSA had the decency to keep its own civilians out of harm's way as much as possible. It was a repressive regime that fought for the right to own slaves. HAMAS is a repressive regime that fights for the right to kill Jews. The difference is that the people are forced to die for that cause while the CSA only forced soldiers to. 


So if continuing the conflict as it is isn't the solution to HAMAS, what is?"

Since most Israelis believe them and the Palestinian resistance to be genocidal terrorists, Why are they not targeting civilians? 

In the entire Iranian ballistic missile attack virtually none of it was aimed at civilians. Hezbollah is targeting occupied territory but nothing in the mainland on civilian targets. Why?

I mean I get the piddly rockets from Hamas (that have killed nearly no one) are just randomly aimed. But clearly The Lebanese resistance is capable of targeting specific areas and getting past the mountains of defense set up. 

The same goes for Iran. Why are they not targeting civilians. The IDF seems to almost exclusively target civilians or civilian rich targets. I would imagine if they (the resistance to the occupation) were even slightly vengeful and possessed the capability (which it's now clear they do) they would target masses of civilians in Israel. But they don't...

Is that because they abide to a higher moral code then the terrorist IDF? It certainly seems that way.

Please don't come at this question with hypotheticals In islamophobic racism. Any example must include military targets versus civilian targets/casualties examples. Otherwise we're just blowing smoke."

https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-military-human-shields.html

For those who would like a pr√©cis of the content and who their sources are: 

> ‚ÄúPalestinian detainees have been coerced to explore places in Gaza where the Israeli military believes that Hamas militants have prepared an ambush or a booby trap. The practice has gradually become more widespread since the start of the war last October. Detainees have been forced to scout and film inside tunnel networks where soldiers believed fighters were still hiding. They have entered buildings rigged with mines to find hidden explosives. They have been told to pick up or move objects like generators and water tanks that Israeli soldiers feared concealed tunnel entrances or booby traps. The Times interviewed seven Israeli soldiers who observed or participated in the practice and presented it as routine, commonplace and organized, conducted with considerable logistical support and the knowledge of superiors on the battlefield.‚Äù

I‚Äôd very much like to hear some opinions on this.

I suspect the initial reaction from some would be to immediately question the bias/reliability of the NYT, however I‚Äôll point out that this particular newspaper has a *very* substantial circulation amongst democrats in the US (though that is not their entire audience by any stretch). This being the case, it seems highly unlikely a storied and very well respected paper would suddenly publish wholesale fabrications which make Biden and Harris‚Äô support for Israel look untenable within 3 weeks of the most important election in US history.

The other point I‚Äôd like to make regards how institutionalised this (highly illegal) behaviour seems to be. Clearly, these aren‚Äôt one-off incidents, as per the testimony of IDF personnel in this article. That being the case, it evidently is considered an acceptable tactic within the IDF. This strongly implies there are other, (if possible) *even more flagrant* examples of war crimes which are committed in the pursuit of minor tactical advantages. "

I thought of some of the most brutal and horrific crimes that I know *just of the top of my head* and responded to their post with the comment I just copied and pasted below, but they literally read this list and continued to double down. They thought about these things and really responded by saying ‚Äòwell, people are starving in Gaza too and some pregnant women shave died, so it‚Äôs basically the same‚Äô. **So it‚Äôs basically the same as Auschwitz???** Like, are you kidding me? Obviously there is suffering in Gaza, like any other war - especially a war where the invaded government intentionally puts its own people and hospitals and schools in the crossfire so they can use their deaths for propaganda. But that‚Äôs *not* what happened in the Holocaust - when the Nazis came into villages and cities and countries and literally rounded everybody they hated up - with the help of those people‚Äôs own *neighbors* - and tortured and killed them all systematically with methods and machinery specifically intended to exterminate as many people as possible as efficiently as possible. At the height of Operation Reinhard the Nazis were exterminating 15-20 *thousand* people a *day* at several camps specifically designed to kill that many and dispose of their bodies to cover up their tracks. Trains and trains of people would arrive and nobody would ever leave. How anybody could look at Gaza now and compare it to that is so far beyond my understanding. 

I included my response to them below: 

>‚ÄùLet me know when the Israelis build bone crushers to grind down the skeletons of the dead to hide the evidence of mass murder. Let me know when they design buildings disguised as showers to horrifically asphyxiate entire families, including infants, women, and children - as many people as possible -within minutes.
>Let me know when they invent special high-capacity crematoria to burn thousands of bodies daily, with prisoners forced to handle the remains of their own friends and relatives.
>Let me know when they conduct medical experiments on civilians, sewing people together, injecting them with diseases, or freezing them to death for ‚Äòresearch.‚Äô
>Let me know when they systematically starve, beat, and work men deemed ‚Äúfit‚Äù for slave labor until they collapse as muselm√§n ‚Äîemaciated, mindless shells awaiting their inevitable death.
>Let me know when they force women to strip and dance in front of piles of burning bodies before they shoot them in the head.
>Let me know when they force entire villages to line up and dig their own graves before they shoot them.
>Let me know when they force people to stand outside barefoot in freezing temperatures until their feet blacken with frostbite, only to amputate their limbs for medical ‚Äòresearch.‚Äô
>Let me know when they execute mothers holding their babies to save bullets, killing both with a single shot.
>Let me know when they pack thousands into suffocating cattle cars for days without food, water, or toilets, only to send the ones that survive the trip straight to gas chambers when they finally let them out.
>Let me know when they strip people naked, tattoo numbers on their arms, and turn their skin into lampshades or other household items.
>This is such a sick comparison and shows that you don‚Äôt understand or care to understand the sheer magnitude of cruelty of the Nazis.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt understand how anybody could think of all these things and think it‚Äôs a fair comparison to what‚Äôs happening in Gaza. Is it bad faith or just despicable ignorance brought on by (pretty obvious) propaganda? There will never be a valid argument in my eyes for such a comparison. That type of rhetoric only serves to disregard and disrespect all of the suffering and misery endured by the millions of victims of the Holocaust, while making their entire stance just completely invalid.

1g4llig,Starting to lose sympathy for Israel,2024-10-15 23:30:46,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g4llig/starting_to_lose_sympathy_for_israel/,"I‚Äôm a privileged person in the West away from the war with no ties to either side. The events of October 7 shocked me and made me realise the kind of threats Israel faces. Watching the brutal footage from that day left me waking up in tears for so many nights. Since then, I‚Äôve been a strong supporter of Israel, sharing my views on social media and attending pro-Israel events. I learned that Jewish people have a right to a safe homeland, having peacefully accepted the UN‚Äôs partition plan, while their Arab neighbors have constantly attacked.

I understood Israel's need to defend itself and that its actions are aimed at Hamas, not innocent Palestinians. It frustrated me to see some of my pro-Palestinian friends sharing misinformation about Israel targeting hospitals and schools, not realising Hamas uses those as military sites. The protests in my city and on campus made me angry; I felt they were unaware of the horrors of October 7, otherwise they would understand what Israel is doing.

As a woman, lesbian, and vegan, I saw Israel as the Middle East's future: the only democracy where women have equal rights, where LGBTQ+ individuals are celebrated, and where farm animals are not slaughtered during bloody rituals. 

However, after watching heartbreaking videos of Palestinians suffering over the last few months, mothers burying their children, kids recounting their families deaths, all of Gaza almost destroyed - my perspective is shifting. I initially thought solely of blaming Hamas, but now it feels too heavy to ignore the immense pain on the Palestinian side. While I acknowledge Israel's efforts to minimise civilian casualties, thousands of Palestinians have died, many with no connection to Hamas and unaware of the conflict. The one ""pushing the button"" is not Hamas.

I no longer believe Israel's actions are justified. How can they continue this war when there's so much suffering? Some argue that any country would respond similarly to protect its citizens, but I‚Äôm beginning to disagree. From the start, Israel should have prioritised the safe return of hostages above all else, as any civilised nation would.

This war, initiated by Hamas, is causing too much pain for both sides. Violence breeds more violence; while Israel may eliminate Hamas militants, they risk raising new terrorists from all this devastation.

I now feel Israel's response is disproportionate. My heart remains with the Israeli hostages and their families, as well as all innocent Palestinian families. I still believe that the pro-Palestinian movement is often one-sided and that Israel has a right to exist, and that the State of Palestine shouldn‚Äôt be recognised while Hamas holds power. However, I now also believe that Israel's actions, while not genocide, are equally cruel. Israel can and should defend itself, but it matters how.¬†All innocent lives matter, and there must be another way beyond terrorism and war."

>We are 99 American physicians, surgeons, nurse practitioners, nurses, and midwives who have volunteered in the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023. Combined, we spent 254 weeks volunteering in Gaza‚Äôs hospitals and clinics. We worked with various nongovernmental organizations and the World Health Organization in hospitals and clinics throughout the Strip. In addition to our medical and surgical expertise, many of us have a public health background, as well as experience working in humanitarian and conflict zones, including Ukraine during the brutal Russian invasion. Some of us are veterans and reservists. We are a multifaith and multiethnic group. None of us support the horrors committed on October 7 by Palestinian armed groups and individuals in Israel.

>

>The Constitution of the World Health Organization states: ‚ÄúThe health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security and is dependent on the fullest cooperation of individuals and States.‚Äù It is in this spirit that we write to you in this open letter.

>

>We are among the only neutral observers who have been permitted to enter the Gaza Strip since October 7. Given our broad expertise and direct experience of working throughout Gaza we are uniquely positioned to comment on several matters of importance to our government as it decides whether to continue supporting Israel‚Äôs attack on, and siege of, the Gaza Strip. Specifically, we believe we are well positioned to comment on the massive human toll from Israel‚Äôs attack on Gaza, especially the toll it has taken on women and children.

>

>This letter collects and summarizes our own experiences and direct observations in Gaza. The letter is accompanied by a detailed appendix summarizing the publicly available information from media, humanitarian, and academic sources on key aspects of Israel‚Äôs invasion of Gaza. Both this letter and the appendix are available electronically at GazaHealthcareLetters.org. This website also houses letters from Canadian and British healthcare workers to their respective governments, making many similar observations to those herein.

>

>This letter and the appendix show probative evidence that the human toll in Gaza since October is far higher than is understood in the United States. **It is likely that the death toll from this conflict is already greater than 118,908, an astonishing 5.4% of Gaza‚Äôs population.**

>

>Our government must act immediately to prevent an even worse catastrophe than what has already befallen the people of Gaza and Israel. **A ceasefire must be imposed on the warring parties by withholding military support for Israel and supporting an international arms embargo on Israel and all Palestinian armed groups.** We believe our government is obligated to do this, both under American law and International Humanitarian Law. We also believe it is the right thing to do.

>

>***""I‚Äôve never seen such horrific injuries, on such a massive scale, with so few resources. Our bombs are cutting down women and children by the thousands. Their mutilated bodies are a monument to cruelty.‚Äù -- Dr. Feroze Sidhwa, trauma and critical care surgeon, Veterans Affairs general surgeon***

>

>**With only marginal exceptions, everyone in Gaza is sick, injured, or both. This includes every national aid worker, every international volunteer, and probably every Israeli hostage: every man, woman, and child.** While working in Gaza we saw widespread malnutrition in our patients and our Palestinian healthcare colleagues. Every one of us lost weight rapidly in Gaza despite having privileged access to food and having taken our own supplementary nutrient-dense food with us. We have photographic evidence of life-threatening malnutrition in our patients, especially children, that we are eager to share with you.

>

>Virtually every child under the age of five whom we encountered, both inside and outside of the hospital, had both a cough and watery diarrhea. We found cases of jaundice (indicating hepatitis A infection under such conditions) in nearly every room of the hospitals in which we served, and in many of our healthcare colleagues in Gaza. An astonishingly high percentage of our surgical incisions became infected from the combination of malnutrition, impossible operating conditions, lack of basic sanitation supplies such as soap, and lack of surgical supplies and medications, including antibiotics.

>

>Malnutrition led to widespread spontaneous abortions, underweight newborns, and an inability of new mothers to breastfeed. This left their newborns at high risk of death given the lack of access to potable water anywhere in Gaza. Many of those infants died. **In Gaza we watched malnourished mothers feed their underweight newborns infant formula made with poisonous water. We can never forget that the world abandoned these innocent women and babies.**

>

>***‚ÄùEvery day I saw babies die. They had been born healthy. Their mothers were so malnourished that they could not breastfeed, and we lacked formula or clean water to feed them, so they starved.‚Äù -- Asma Taha, pediatric nurse practitioner***

>

>We urge you to realize that epidemics are raging in Gaza. **Israel‚Äôs continued, repeated displacement of the malnourished and sick population of Gaza, half of whom are children, to areas without running water or even toilets available is absolutely shocking.** It was and remains guaranteed to result in widespread death from viral and bacterial diarrheal diseases and pneumonias, particularly in children under the age of five. Indeed, even the dreaded polio virus has reemerged in Gaza due to a combination of systematic destruction of the sanitation infrastructure, widespread malnutrition weakening immune systems, and young children having missed routine vaccinations for nearly an entire year. We worry that unknown thousands have already died from the lethal combination of malnutrition and disease, and that tens of thousands more will die in the coming months, especially with the onset of the winter rains in Gaza. **Most of them will be young children.**

>

>***‚ÄùGaza was the first time I held a baby‚Äôs brains in my hand. The first of many.‚Äù -- Dr. Mark Perlmutter, orthopedic and hand surgeon***

>

>Children are universally considered innocents in armed conflict. However, every single signatory to this letter saw children in Gaza who suffered violence that must have been deliberately directed at them. **Specifically, every one of us who worked in an emergency, intensive care, or surgical setting treated pre-teen children who were shot in the head or chest on a regular or even a daily basis. It is impossible that such widespread shooting of young children throughout Gaza, sustained over the course of an entire year is accidental or unknown to the highest Israeli civilian and military authorities.**

>

>**President Biden and Vice President Harris, we wish you could see the nightmares that plague so many of us since we have returned: dreams of children maimed and mutilated by our weapons, and their inconsolable mothers begging us to save them. We wish you could hear the cries and screams our consciences will not let us forget. We cannot fathom why you continue arming the country that is deliberately killing these children en masse.**

>

>***‚ÄùI saw so many stillbirths and maternal deaths that could have been easily prevented if the hospitals had been functioning normally.‚Äù -- Dr. Thalia Pachiyannakis, obstetrician and gynecologist***

>

>The pregnant and breastfeeding women we treated were particularly malnourished. **Those of us who worked with pregnant women regularly saw stillbirths and maternal deaths that were easily preventable in any developing country‚Äôs healthcare system.** The rate of infection in C-section incisions was astonishing. **Women underwent vaginal deliveries and even C-sections without anesthesia and were given nothing but Tylenol afterwards because no other pain medications were available.**

>

>We all observed emergency departments overwhelmed by patients seeking treatment for chronic medical conditions such as renal failure, hypertension, and diabetes. Aside from trauma patients, most ICU beds were occupied by patients with type 1 diabetes who no longer had access to insulin. The lack of medication availability, the widespread loss of electricity and refrigeration, and inconsistent access to food made managing this disease impossible. **Israel has destroyed more than half of Gaza‚Äôs healthcare resources and has killed nearly one thousand Palestinian healthcare workers, more than one out of every 20 healthcare workers in Gaza. At the same time healthcare needs have increased massively from the lethal combination of military violence, malnutrition, disease, and displacement.**

>

>The hospitals where we worked were starved of basic supplies from, surgical material to soap. They were regularly cut off from electricity and Internet access, denied clean water, and operated at four to seven times their bed capacity. Every hospital was overwhelmed beyond the breaking point by displaced persons seeking safety, by the constant stream of sick and malnourished patients seeking care, and by the huge influx of seriously wounded patients who typically arrived in mass casualty events.

>

>**These observations and the publicly available material detailed in the appendix lead us to believe that the death toll from this conflict is many times higher than what is reported by the Gaza Ministry of Health. We also believe this is probative evidence of widespread violations of American laws governing the use of American weapons abroad, and of International Humanitarian Law. We cannot forget scenes of unbearable cruelty directed at women and children that our government is a direct participant in.**

>

>As we met our healthcare colleagues in Gaza it was clear that they were malnourished, and both physically and mentally devastated. **We quickly learned that our Palestinian healthcare colleagues were among the most traumatized people in Gaza, and perhaps in the entire world.** Like virtually all people in Gaza they had lost family members and their homes. Most lived in and around their hospitals with their surviving family in unimaginable conditions. Although they continued working a grueling schedule, they had not been paid since October 7. **All were acutely aware that their work as healthcare providers had marked them as targets for Israel. This makes a mockery of the protected status hospitals and healthcare providers are granted under the oldest and most widely accepted provisions of International Humanitarian Law.**

>

>We met healthcare personnel in Gaza who worked at hospitals that had been raided and destroyed by Israel. Many of these colleagues of ours were taken by Israel during the attacks. They all told us a slightly different version of the same story: in captivity they were barely fed, continuously physically and psychologically abused, and finally dumped naked on the side of a road. Many told us they were subjected to mock executions and other forms of mistreatment and torture. Far too many of our healthcare colleagues told us they were simply waiting to die.

>

>**The 99 signatories to this letter spent a combined 254 weeks inside Gaza‚Äôs largest hospitals and clinics. We wish to be absolutely clear: not once did any of us see any type of Palestinian militant activity in any of Gaza‚Äôs hospitals or other healthcare facilities.**

>

>**We urge you to see that Israel has systematically and deliberately devastated Gaza‚Äôs entire healthcare system, and that Israel has targeted our colleagues in Gaza for torture, disappearance, and murder.**

>

>President Biden and Vice President Harris, any solution to this problem must begin with an immediate and permanent ceasefire. **We appreciate that you are working on a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, but you have overlooked an obvious fact: the United States can impose a ceasefire on the warring parties by simply stopping arms shipments to Israel, and announcing that we will participate in an international arms embargo on both Israel and all Palestinian armed groups. We stress what many others have repeatedly told you over the past year: American law is perfectly clear on this matter, continuing to arm Israel is illegal.**

>

>**President Biden and Vice President Harris, we urge you to immediately withhold military, economic, and diplomatic support from the State of Israel and to participate in an international arms embargo of Israel and all Palestinian armed groups until a permanent ceasefire is established in Gaza, including the release of all Israeli and Palestinian hostages, and until a permanent resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is negotiated between the two parties. Vice President Harris, as the likely next president of the United States, we urge you to publicly announce your support for such a policy, and to state publicly that you are duty-bound to uphold the laws of the United States even when doing so is politically inconvenient.**

>

>**President Biden and Vice President Harris, we are 99 American physicians and nurses who have witnessed crimes beyond comprehension. Crimes that we cannot believe you wish to continue supporting. Please meet with us to discuss what we saw, and why we feel American policy in the Middle East must change immediately.**

>

>In the meantime, we reiterate what we wrote in our letter of July 25, 2024:

>

>The Rafah Crossing between Gaza and Egypt must be immediately reopened, and must allow unfettered aid delivery by recognized international humanitarian organizations. Security screening of aid deliveries must be conducted by an independent international inspection regime instead of by Israeli forces. These screenings must be based on a clear, unambiguous, and published list of forbidden items, and with a clear independent international mechanism for challenging forbidden items, as verified by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the occupied Palestinian territory.

>

>A bare minimum water allocation of 15L of potable water per person per day, the [Sphere Handbook](https://www.spherestandards.org/wp-content/uploads/Sphere-Handbook-2018-EN.pdf) minimum in a humanitarian emergency, must be allocated to the population of Gaza, as verified by UN Water.

>

>Full and unrestricted access of medical and surgical professionals and medical and surgical equipment to the Gaza Strip must be resumed. This must include items taken in healthcare professionals‚Äô personal luggage to safeguard their proper storage, sterility, and timely delivery, as verified by the World Health Organization. **Incredibly, Israel continues to block healthcare workers of Palestinian descent from working in Gaza, even American citizens. This makes a mockery of the American ideal that ‚Äúall men are created equal‚Äù and degrades both our national ideals and our profession. Our work is lifesaving. Our Palestinian healthcare colleagues in Gaza are desperate for relief and protection, and they deserve both.**

>

>We are not politicians. We do not claim to have all the answers. We are simply healing professionals who cannot remain silent about what we saw in Gaza. **Every day that we continue supplying weapons and munitions to Israel is another day that women are shredded by our bombs and children are murdered with our bullets.**

>

>**President Biden and Vice President Harris, we urge you: end this madness** ***now***\*\*!\*\*

>

>Sincerely,

Netanyahu did say that he wanted to wipe out Hamas. Hamas is a political group with a militant wing, according to Wikipedia. 

Based on my understanding, the intent to eradicate Hamas cannot be genocide because it is a political group. So I'd like to understand why some characterize the war in Gaza as genocide. 

I've never heard the global war on terror characterized as genocide, even though I think that characterization might actually be more appropriate in that context (e.g., the war against ISIS and AQ). 

Also, I haven't seen groups that have an intent to destroy Israel (e.g., Hamas, Iran ruling party, Houthi, etc.) referred to as genocidal groups. Are they genocidal?"

The people of these countries have been vocal about this situation for the past year and finally governments are appearing to sing a different tune. 

For many of us, this is the first war broadcast through our phones. Our lives will never be the same again. We can never see Israel the same again. 

‚ÄúPariah states tend to develop resentments against the established world order. They may seek to subvert the international status quo.‚Äù Seems on par with what we‚Äôre seeing today. 

Would becoming a pariah state be enough for the other side to finally see what they‚Äôve been doing is inhumane?

To my understanding it seems to not affect us and specifically younger people (18-24). So why are they so emotionally charged? Knowing that realistically 99% of us are not in the position of power or control to meaningfully change anything?

1g4b767,The Palestinian cause seemingly has nothing to do with actually establishing a Palestinian country,2024-10-15 16:01:23,87,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g4b767/the_palestinian_cause_seemingly_has_nothing_to_do/,"The Palestinian strategy, it has become clear, has less to do with peaceful coexistence with Israel than the complete destruction or elimination of Israel. Even in the West, the pro-palestinian propaganda has taken such a hold that university students are also less interested in a 2-state solution (which at this point seems improbable) and more so on dismantling Israel as an entity altogether.

While this approach riles people up into a frenzy, often bolstered by fake propaganda disseminated by Hamas affiliated outlets and shared by well-meaning folks with little knowledge of middle eastern history (as we saw recently where they claimed children were burned alive - come to find out this was not true), it ultimately does nothing to move along the Palestinian quest for statehood (assuming this is their top priority).

The reality is that Israel is a democratic country with nearly 10 million people. It has been around for about as long as almost any other middle eastern country, and the idea that it will simply disappear, or implode, or be conquered etc. is nothing short of a delusion that prevents Palestinians from actually pursuing achievable goals - you know, like peaceful coexistence and a country they can call their own.

While the current approach is perhaps appropriate if the goal is to demonize Israel, it truly does nothing to help the Palestinian cause because Israel isn‚Äôt going anywhere.¬† This is why we now hear nothing about releasing the hostages. It‚Äôs why we heard nothing about Hezbollah raining down missles on Israel for nearly a full year. 

Actions have causes and effects. And when it comes to Israel, people will often disregard the cause and act as if Israel's actions happen in a vaccum. It's a rather elementary way to analyze a conflict and demonstrates either a profound lack of knowledge about the conflict or wilfull ignorance.

The entire Gaza War could end tomorrow if Hamas hands back the hostages, but pro-palestinian supporters seem content with Hamas holding onto them and continuing the fight/war, and then complain when the war isn't going their way. A ceasefire works both ways and requires 2 parties to agree.

Additionally, a ceasefire by definition is temporary. Maybe peace is a better option? Unfortunately, Palestinian leaders have rejected every peace offer ever made because it doesn't include every demand - no matter how absurd - they make. The greedy notion that the ENTIRE land is Palestinian has precluded the Palestinians from having their own state for nearly 8 decades. Hopefully this will somehow change in the future and COMPROMISE can replace the current one-sided and militant approach.

1g43wch,"I really want an opinion on this and about Zionism, just in its basic definition (as it‚Äôs used in many ways now) ",2024-10-15 09:45:58,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g43wch/i_really_want_an_opinion_on_this_and_about/,"I truly want to know a response to this. Zionism, technically is the right to well Jerusalem, certain surrounding land, and ya know literal zion lol. In its most basic definition. 

So what we typically don‚Äôt go for now a days is atrocity in the name of religion. So slaughtering and displacing hundreds of thousands of Arabs obviously is horrible. They were so horribly brutal to the Arabs when Israel was ‚Äúreclaimed‚Äù. We know this for a fact. In that case I certainly am against Zionism, you don‚Äôt have any right to your land from thousands of years ago because of a silly book, and yes I‚Äôm against all atrocities in the name of religions from every religious text in the world from any religion lol. 

If it was about having a Jewish nation, there were other places in the world that this was far more feasible (that were not in religious texts) It‚Äôs interesting to condemn Palestine for their religious anti lgbt beliefs (which I do) but then not condemn the religious beliefs that state that you lay claim to land from thousands of years ago and can take it by force. 

Speaking of lgbt rights, in say Palestine, it was decriminalized in 1950 or so in many areas. Obviously it‚Äôs very taboo and in some places they‚Äôll just slaughter you. But of course they have been occupied by a military force and in some places live in an apartheid community, AND have been brutalized for years and years. We know this factually too. If you‚Äôve been occupied by another military force and you‚Äôve been being bombed and brutalized, which is clear before Hamas and even before hezbollah, you aren‚Äôt instigating, you‚Äôre fighting back.. It‚Äôs obvious what the Israeli military force has been doing over the years, theres enough clear evidence, and clear video evidence, and it wasn‚Äôt keeping ‚Äúorder‚Äù. 

Obviously I condemn Hamas. We have all also seen the brutality of Hamas. And it‚Äôs despicable. But this is just all hypocritical and in the end based in middle eastern racism or just ignorance. The two state solution was never really Israel‚Äôs goal, their political leaders have been actually relatively transparent on this. 

I actually also have no doubt being gay would be illegal in America still if we were occupied by a huge military force in an open air prison. Of course when this is the case, historically, no real progress occurs within that society. Now I am asking this to gain insight not to instigate hate, regardless that I did use some intense words. "
1g42bjb,"The ""Jesus was a Palestinian"" saga",2024-10-15 07:37:25,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g42bjb/the_jesus_was_a_palestinian_saga/,"As we get closer to christmas, I can only assume that we will see this topic resurface. Last year I saw this come up a lot, especially in conversations related to Jesus's skin color or ethnicity (i.e - not white). 

To be perfectly clear, this take is absoluty wrong and misunderstanding og history. But I would like to hear people who do believe this to be true explain their thought process. 

For conversation's sake, here are some of the argument I already heard being made:

1. The land had always been called Palestine, hence Jesus, who was born in Bethlehem, is a Palestininan - this is simply historicaly inaccurate.  Bethlehem was, probably, originally a Caananite settlement, and later part of the kindom of Judea.   The land was dubbed Syria-Palestina only in 2 century AD, after the Bar Kokhva revolt attempt on the Romans. 

2. The palestinians are descendants of the Caananites, and so is Jesus, they share the same ethnicity - even if the Palestinians are descendants of the esrly Caananites, and that is a big if seeing as it is far more likely they came to the area during the Arab conquest, Jesus was a Jew living in the kigdom of Judea. Jesus lived and died a Jew, and not a part of the caaninite tribes at the Area (that were scarce to non-existant at the time).

3. Being Jewish is a religion, not an ethnicity, Jesus was a Palestinian Jew - people with historical Jewish roots have DNA resemblence to each other, sometimes even more than to the native land they were living in (pre-Israel, that is). Jews and Jewish-ness are, and always has been, an ETHNO-ETHNO-religous group, not just a religion.

I think this pretty much sums it up in terms of what I heard, but I am gen genuinely intrigued to hear more opopinions about the topic."
1g3vbzr,What is the endgame for pro-Palestine supporters?,2024-10-15 00:38:22,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g3vbzr/what_is_the_endgame_for_propalestine_supporters/,"I‚Äôve heard ad nauseam the slogan ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,"" which calls for the eradication of Israel as a state. For the sake of argument, let's say Israel's government and the IDF hypothetically agree to dissolve the State of Israel and relinquish control entirely to groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, and/or the Palestinian Authority. What happens next?

Considering the record that Palestinians (and Muslims) have ""achieved"" when it comes to minorities, it seems like everything would end up in a horrific mass genocide akin to October 7th, targeting not just Jews but also Christians, Bah√° º√≠s, atheists, LGBTQ+, and most likely also Israeli Muslims whom will be perceived as traitors.

After this real genocide is committed, it seems to me that there will be a civil war among the Palestinian factions, all of them fighting for dominance, similar to what happened when Gaza was handed: rampant political repression, murder of dissidents, and widespread corruption, just as we see today.

Given the real-world consequences that would likely follow, I‚Äôm asking this question in all seriousness: what is the point of pushing for such an outcome? Does the world need another failed state, another breeding ground for more violence and instability?

I'd genuinely like to hear from those who support the idea of a ‚ÄúPalestine free from the river to the sea‚Äù, what is the actual endgame? and more importantly: is it worth it?

Thank you

1g3r7vq,Is Smotrich planning to grant permanent residence to WB Palestinians?,2024-10-14 21:24:20,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g3r7vq/is_smotrich_planning_to_grant_permanent_residence/,"I came across this video on twitter:¬†[https://x.com/upholdreality/status/1844192070614794487](https://x.com/upholdreality/status/1844192070614794487)¬†that shows Smotrich talk about the political plan to annex the west bank. In it, he has described giving Palestinians who give up nationalist aspirations and pledge loyalty to Israel,¬†**residential rights which I am interpreting as permanent residence**. He says that those that won't pledge loyalty to Israel will be given compensation to emigrate. And for those that don't pledge loyalty, nor emigrate, they will be ""defeated"".

Putting aside the emigration and the ""defeat"" (whatever that means), how would residential rights for west bank Palestinians work? In the case of annexation of WB (a forgone conclusion since the right wing in Israel does get everything), I am guessing a significant number of Palestinians will begrudgingly accept residency, in the face of no alternatives. Would this residency status be the same as the status given to East Jerusalem Arabs after 1967 when they refused to accept Israeli citizenship? Given that there are approximately 2.5-2.7 million Palestinians in the WB, even a partial acceptance by the WB Palestinians (lets say even 1 million) will change Israel rapidly.

If the status being considered for the WB Palestinians after the annexation is similar to that of the East Jerusalem Arabs, i.e. permanent residence (sans the ability to apply for citizenship), how does that not fundamentally transform Israel and bring it closer to a single state! If these new residents can live, work, study, bank, start businesses, buy and rent property anywhere in Israel, (as the permanent residents of Israel can!) then does it not sort of negate the idea of Zionism?"

Most likely to avoid the wrath of the YouTube mods and/or either side of the conflict.

Then in August of 2024, Mr Table had the video reuploaded onto the cite:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk5iOTunvcM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk5iOTunvcM)

I have seen the original upload when it first came about. With this evil show, it's disturbing to realize that the children who grew up with it are now grown up and fighting now. Personally, those show exposes everything wrong with Hamas. 

-Blaming EVERYTHING (like Fafour cheating on a test) on the Jews or aany other foe.

-Glamorizing a woman suicide bomber INFRONT OF HER OWN CHILDREN in hopes said children aand other kids will do the same.

-Harming animals while teaching kids not to hurt them.

-Encouraging kids to sing songs like ""The answer is an AK-47"".

-Adding an audience of children in the later seasons in hopes to keep Israel from bombing the studio. 

-Using character deaths to encite the child viewers. 

That's not even ALL of what this show had done! From all of this, I just don't get why people are calling Hamas ""Freedom fighters"" or listen to anything that comes from the mouths of Hamas. Or even getting as Nick Crowley for covering ""Tomorrow's Pioneers"". Seriously, if Palestine REALLY wants to be free, then they must be rid of Hamas or any other fundelmentalist group. Otherwise it'll be no different than present-day Iran or Afghanistan. "
1g3o4ap,Redoing my last question to add more: why are Israeli hospitals not military targets?,2024-10-14 19:16:34,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g3o4ap/redoing_my_last_question_to_add_more_why_are/,"Okay so I JUST posted this before but a few commenters made me want to add things and I wanted to start fresh so everyone could see the post with the added details instead of some only seeing it after it was added.

If you commented in that original thread, I'd love to hear from you again with these added details! ‚ô°

~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm asking because all the hospitals in Gaza have been destroyed or nearly destroyed due to Hamas apparently being there, even when evidence points in another direction. 

Would the Israeli hospitals that are taking in the injured soldiers (and I assume non-injured military personnel are there as well to talk to nurses/doctors and whatnot) be legitimate targets now?

~~~~~~~~~~~

The answers I got to that question were unequivocally no, which is fair. I should've seen those responses coming from a mile away. Anyways, I feel I could get more understanding of the perspective if I get answers to these next questions, as well.

Let's say the IDF *is* using hospitals as bases to conduct military operations. Is it okay then?

At what point does a hospital become an operations center? If three Hamas fighters with broken legs start talking about operations, is it a command center? If there are more than three rifles, is it a command center? What constitutes a command center? If you say Hamas was using these hospitals to conduct military actions, please cite sources and specify which hospitals you are talking about."
1g3n24y,New York Times: How Israel‚Äôs Army Uses Palestinians as Human Shields in Gaza,2024-10-14 18:33:22,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g3n24y/new_york_times_how_israels_army_uses_palestinians/,"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-military-human-shields.html

This article was just posted today. 

It goes through how the IDF uses human shields to reduce IDF casualties. Instead of using modern technology in the year 2024 that the most moral and advanced army in the world would have access to, it seemed easier to use Palestinian civilians to test whether or not an area was booby trapped.

I'm not surprised by their findings, but an unintended ""consequence"" (for lack of a better word) of this article, though, was changing my mind about Hamas actions in a way. For the longest time, I thought it was a ridiculous assertion that Hamas booby trapped already ruined areas. But, this just proved me wrong!

Anyways, what are your thoughts?"
1g3g0kt,What is Israel's endgame in Lebanon?,2024-10-14 13:40:20,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g3g0kt/what_is_israels_endgame_in_lebanon/,"On the 14th October, Israel attacked the town of Aitou, a majority Christian town in the North, with the stated target of a Hezbollah commander there. As of now, the attack has 18 people, as of yet unclear how many are combatants and how many are civilians....

This follows yesterday's drone attack by Hezbollah on an Israeli military base that killed 4 Israeli personnel and injured dozens of others. (How it got past the Iron Dome remains a question)

It's a matter of public record that Hezbollah entered the war already a year ago by attacking Israeli territory with rockets over 11 months. A month ago, Israel escalated the tit for tat conflict by assassinating all of its leadership, including Nasrallah himself. Next step was the announcement of pin pointed ground attacks on specified positions.

Yesterday, there was a leak of Israel's demands in exchange for a ceasefire:

""1. Enforcement of UN Resolution 1701 that would push Hezbollah away from the border, including disarmament of Lebanese militias.

2. International oversight to prevent rearmament of Hezbollah, with a focus on the Syrian-Lebanese border.

3. Israel must maintain the ability to act throughout Lebanon when it identifies threats, including limited pinpoint ground operations.""

  
Ok. Those are the stated public objectives, but what Israel's actual strategy to achiever them is, remains the question.

How does Israel not end up in an extended quagmire with no end? What indication is there that it will be able to combat the drone attacks and rocket fire on its own? 

What is Israel's endgame, strategic calculations other than a neverending escalated conflict with Hezbollah via air attacks across all of Lebanon, while receiving rocket barrages hitting the North of Israel?

How would Israel win this war, and not end up with a difficult narrative of Hezbollah surviving, despite a rough start?"

Their lives are upended by conflicts they have no control over, their only crime being born at the wrong time, in the wrong place, or belonging to a different group. Countries invest trillions in militaries and weapons, while countless lives are lost and communities destroyed. Like people lives can actually be saved, instead of meaningless f\*cking death and destruction.

Imagine if those trillions were redirected towards addressing global issues like poverty, hunger, disease, and climate change. The potential benefits are immense. We could save lives, improve living standards, and create a more sustainable future.

For example, the money spent on a single fighter jet could fund thousands of children's education, provide clean water to entire villages, or support medical research to develop life-saving treatments. Instead of pouring resources into weapons of destruction, let's invest in building a better world for everyone.

Everyone, regardless of their background, deserves a chance at a better life. Let's prioritize human well-being over military might. It's time to build a world based on peace, cooperation, and compassion.

1g36ye1,Is Iran a true friend of the Palestinian people?,2024-10-14 03:18:54,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g36ye1/is_iran_a_true_friend_of_the_palestinian_people/,"If Hamas had asked you whether they should carry out the October 7th attack, the obvious response would be an unequivocal no. Even if someone harbored animosity toward Israel or believed the attack was somehow justified, there is no denying the immense consequences that would follow. It's not just about the immediate loss of life on the Israeli side‚Äîkilling civilians is inexcusable‚Äîbut also about the foreseeable devastation that Palestinians would face in the aftermath. History has shown time and again that any attack of this scale will trigger a massive and disproportionate military response from Israel. The result is an overwhelming loss of life, homes, and infrastructure for Palestinians, deepening their suffering.

Furthermore, Iran, which has historically been a vocal supporter of Palestinian causes, did not discourage Hamas from carrying out the attack. This inaction raises serious questions about Iran‚Äôs true motives. If Iran had the influence to stop Hamas, why didn‚Äôt they? It‚Äôs likely that Iran‚Äôs interests are more strategic and self-serving than genuinely rooted in concern for the Palestinian people. Supporting Hamas in such actions may serve Iran‚Äôs geopolitical goals, but at the cost of escalating violence and worsening conditions for the very people they claim to support.

Another critical point to consider is the role of the United States. Despite its close alliance with Israel, the U.S. has consistently provided financial and humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people, often through organizations such as UNRWA and other channels. In fact, the U.S. has given significantly more monetary support for Palestinian causes than Iran ever has. This raises an uncomfortable but important question: Is it possible that the U.S. actually cares more for the well-being of the Palestinian people than the leaders of Iran? While U.S. policies are far from perfect, its financial commitment to humanitarian assistance stands in contrast to Iran‚Äôs military-driven support, which often inflames tensions rather than alleviating suffering.

Moreover, one must ask whether Hamas leadership truly acts in the best interests of Palestinians. By initiating attacks that predictably result in widespread retaliation, they are knowingly putting Palestinian lives at risk. Instead of focusing on improving living conditions, building infrastructure, or seeking diplomatic solutions, they engage in violence that perpetuates the cycle of bloodshed. This raises further doubts about who is truly advocating for the welfare of the Palestinian people.

The complexity of the Israel-Palestine conflict cannot be understated, and there are legitimate grievances on all sides. However, responding to injustice with more violence only ensures that the suffering continues. The tragic irony is that those who claim to fight in the name of freedom and justice often make decisions that lead to more death and destruction for the very people they claim to represent. While emotions and anger run high, the focus must always remain on the preservation of human life and the pursuit of lasting peace. Encouraging more violence only pushes both Palestinians and Israelis further away from that goal.

1g366qk,Most people misunderstand the meaning of October 7th,2024-10-14 02:34:55,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g366qk/most_people_misunderstand_the_meaning_of_october/,"In the context of the Hamas surprise attack on Israel on October 7th of the last year; I believe that the significance of this one-time event that has caused so much misfortune ever since, with so much more looming on the horizon... is that it has three separate dimensions of meaning;

The first dimension is the intelligence failure to predict, prevent, and respond in time to the attack; to most people, this dimension is the most obvious.

As for the two remaining dimensions; this is what most people fail to talk about properly, if they even realize that these two dimensions exist in the first place...

Nevertheless, as for the second dimension, that has been talked about by some, but not enough; is that the saddest part about October 7th is not so much as the attack itself and the atrocities committed on said day; but rather the missed opportunity that the Palestinian nation and their supporters around the world had on their hands to exploit this tragedy to cook something extraordinary in relation to Israel; Oct 7th is not just something that Israel failed to predict; because in actuality, those who know the Israeli narrative well know that Oct 7th was a prophecy;

The Israeli nation has maintained for long that Palestinians cannot be allowed to have a state of their own because that would not only be an existential threat to mainland Israel; but a recipe for a second holocaust;

The fact that Oct 7th happened alone does not prove that this prophecy is true; it was the reaction and the opinion of the entire Palestinian nation along with the wider world that supports them (that hasn't changed much since) in regards to the character of armed Palestinian resistance against illegitimate Israeli use of violence against them and etc.

Now even the most sympathetic people in Israel to the plight of the Palestinians have been reduced to an inconsequential minority.

But aside from that, I would like to introduce a third dimension to this story.

I have seen a near-universal agreement from across the political spectrum that Oct 7th would have a different meaning if the same Hamas militants that crossed the border on that faithful day were only to target the military bases, outposts, and infrastructure along with their military personnel that enveloped Gaza, that would have sent a different message to Israel, and the entire world beyond.

And it's hard to judge, but I believe that this is true to a certain extent that all those who talk of it do not care to elaborate.

And the truth is that if we imagine an alternate reality in which the army of Hamas would have only savaged the IDF and IDF only, ignoring on their way passerby civilians and civilian living spaces; that would have been a far more humiliating blow to Israel's political structure; because for one; Hamas would have had more resources to focus on fighting off the Israeli army and capturing their assets; and for second; the Israeli political establishment would have been enraged all the same but with zero legitimacy to carry out the war in Gaza the way they did; if this were to be true, I seriously could not have imagined a more humiliating knock-out to the entire Israeli narrative in regards to the Palestinian issue on one day after 75 years of two sides playing a game of who can sell a better narrative to the world in who's suffering more, and who has the better moral high ground.

So, in a sense, as a former left-wing Israeli here, thank you to all those who side with the Palestinian cause (whether by voice or direct action)... or rather, fuck you... or thank you... (I don't know which is which)... for confirming the narrative that the Israeli right has been pushing about the Palestinians all these years.

Oct 7th could have been your chance to dismantle the entire Zionist conception of its own righteousness in one swift blow... but even then, you had a second chance to do it all the same... I don't know whether it was a major idiocy on the part of Hamas... or the entire Palestinian movement is a major suicide mission on purpose from the start... if it's both, then that's just awkward."

A horrid amount of us have been killed and degraded even in our deaths by the so-called ‚Äúmost moral‚Äù army in the world, and this is just sick. Whenever I bring up your illegitimate states clear and cut war crimes, your supporters or even you Israelites just say ‚ÄúOctober 7."" And you know what? For the first week or so after October 7, it was an okay excuse for this war, but know I am going to be honest, so what if they died? Don't you think it's enough? Or do you want to keep using their deaths as justifications for your war crimes?

The amount of Palestinians that have died is way more than it should have been, and hell, there should have been no lives taken as October 7 was just karma for your sins creeping up since your occupation after WWII.

Hamas that and Hamas that, are you a broken radio that keeps repeating itself? I don‚Äôt care what Hamas is doing. ‚ÄúBut you Palestinians elected them.""... ? Oh yeah, my bad.

Don‚Äôt you get it? Why do you think this post is so hate-infused? Do you think it is from the propaganda? No. The answer is no. It is from your killings and occupation that I feel this way. The more you keep killing, the more Hamas members it creates, and the more October 7ths will happen. Your own hands are stained with innocent Palestinians, and you own blood.

The worst part about this genocide is the lie about Israel wanting peace and that you have been the ones striding for it. Like WHAT!?! Of course you hypocrites would say that you‚Äôre living with the AC on! You have never experienced loss in this war and still have the audacity to say peace is possible. You have never had loss so your hatred is unfounded as its roots are just from your propaganda.¬†

A big part of why I believe in God is the existence of hell for unjust people like you. I sincerely hope you keep latching on to your beliefs till the day you die so that God may not grant you mercy. And even if there was evidence that your God was real, I would not convert, as I know that evidence was forged, as no just god would endorse the killings of innocents.

1g33qdp,Timeslot for Truce in Lebanon,2024-10-14 00:19:22,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g33qdp/timeslot_for_truce_in_lebanon/,"On September 23, 2024, the IDF announced that it had launched the anticipated Northern Arrows operation against Hezbollah - terrorist organization implementing proxy-war on the behalve of Iran - as a follow-up to the previous Iron of Swords operation focused on destroying Hamas. Hezbollah had already started limited rocket, drone and missile support for Hamas on October 8, 2023, but the IDF responded with a barrage of missiles and limited airstrikes.

The IDF appears to be making progress in destroying Hezbollah‚Äôs military capacity and ability to threaten Israel. The IDF has struck Lebanon from the air, hitting 4,900 targets and around 6,000 ground targets since the start of the war. More than 800 terrorists, including about 90 commanders, have been eliminated. It has just been a year since Hezbollah attacked northern Israel with more than 12,000 missiles and rockets.

Israel needs a truce on terms suitable to it, so that the evacuated residents of its northern border can finally return to their homes. Operating in the middle of a civilian settlement in the Hezbollah support area between the security zone and Beirut would cause significant problems for Israel‚Äôs ground operation, although the destruction to Hezbollah and through it also to Lebanon would be as devastating as Gaza. The continuation of the operation is also expensive, as one anti-ballistic missile Arrow missile costs $3 million, a David Sling costs just under $800,000 and an Iron Dome approximately $50,000 each, and Hezbollah probably still has an arsenal of just under 100,000 rockets, drones and missiles.

In my opinion a truce in the near future would now be in the interest of all parties. Israel now has to tie up its reserves on seven fronts that hinder the return to normal life and economic and political development. Hizbullah (Shia) retains the remnants of its power, but the other two parties to the power-sharing agreement (Christians and Sunni Muslims) rise to a more prominent position, as does the Lebanese army. Iran will avoid the complete destruction of its best trump card and the international community can try to negotiate an agreement on Iran‚Äôs nuclear program and help in any negotiations between the parties.

The terms of the Hezbollah/Lebanon and Israel truce itself do not have to be very complicated, at a minimum a truce could be made by implementing the resolution adopted by the UN ‚Äì UNSC resolution 1701 (2006) ‚Äì  in which the Lebanese Army (LAF) removes Hezbollah‚Äôs armaments from the Litani River and the border ( Blue Line) with the support of UN UNIFIL forces. The Israeli army is doing most of the cleaning work and UNIFIL is already there to continue it.

1g31wq8,IDF troops Uncovering Hezbollah Compound Within Earshot of a UN Compound ,2024-10-13 22:45:47,137,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g31wq8/idf_troops_uncovering_hezbollah_compound_within/,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/s/biRfNARDPp

The UN and others have claimed Israel has been targeting UN troops in recent days, as part of yet another campaign to pressure Israel to stop its just campaign against the radical Islamic terror group Hezbollah. 

The video above sheds some light on the situation on the ground in southern Lebanon. In it, IDF troops uncover a tunnel shaft located very close to a UNIFL camp. 

It goes without saying that the UN and those parroting anti Israel talking points on social media have been gaslighting us or lying about the nature of the situation when they claim ‚ÄúIsrael is targeting UN peacekeeping troops‚Äù. 

Clearly, Hezbollah has been drawing fire from the IDF in a way that would place UN peacekeepers at risk. 

However, this thing goes beyond the world again lying and gaslighting us about the situation. 

I find it very telling that the Hezbollah terror shaft is located so close to two UN observation posts, with towers at least twenty feet high, but was unable to detect the presence of the tunnel shaft within earshot distance. 

Presumably the area is monitored by the UN. 

Otherwise, why are they even there, placing troops on top of observation towers overlooking the area?? 

Did the ‚Äúpeacekeepers‚Äù fail to identify Hezbollah‚Äôs positions built right under their noses?? Are they incompetent? Or is it worse- have they identified these positions but failed to report them, or take any action to address this? 


Keep in mind- Hezbollah building tunnels anywhere in Lebanon, and especially south of the litani river, is a direct violation of UN Security Council resolution 1701, which is why these ‚Äúpeacekeepers‚Äù are there in the first place. This tunnel should‚Äôve been reported, and action should have been taken. For instance, at the very least, the UN troops should‚Äôve left the area because they knew (or should‚Äôve known) that Hezbollah built military installations so close to UN objects‚Ä¶ 

Alas, we hear nothing about it, because the UN doesn‚Äôt seem to be interested in actually monitoring the situation or in presenting the facts as they are. Rather, it is interested in scoring political points against Israel. 

This is yet another example of how the UN is acting in a non neutral way, to the determinant of the Israeli people. Quite frankly, the failures of the UNIFL force puts UN‚Äôs own people at risk, and further erodes the UN‚Äôs credibility as an impartial body and a credible observer.

But in the end of the circle its always people with money the benefit. Like Notting hill and Lower east side where the gentrification has reached the final billionaire class. 

I am thinking that because what they are doing is Illegal, they never actually see any financial reward for doing this, they don't get any ownership of the land they are settling on. In the end of the cycle when a Illegal settlement is legalized and slated for development. Do the original settlers get any land rights? Or is it all later developed for Jews with jobs, money, kids and the whole nine yards? Maybe they are not doing this for money, and when its done they move to another outpost. But seems a bit like they are the pawns on a chess-set because they are putting their lives on the line for little to no monetary rewards.

Also seeing that a lot of these youths, particularly the violent ones strike me as very at-risk type people. Druggie unemployables who found a messianic branches of Judaism and belonging. Just sort of gives me the feeling that they are not on top of the chain and in the end taken advantage of. "

Are school teachers at least aware of the falsely led actions of the country and try to face it in their classes?

To solve Jews problems, but to not allow space for Jews in their own countries, 
The West encouraged Zionism. 
To save desperate Jewish refugees, 
Jews created Palestinian refugees. 
To establish the independent state, 
To win Arabs in wars, 
They tried to ethnically cleanse Palestinians. 
This is the truth of the foundation of the state of Israel. 

Some Jews do not even accept the existence of Palestinian people and ignore the term 'Palestinians' right of return'.

Imagine if Britons and Picts as ethnic groups had lived in this 21st century with the nationality of English and had claimed that England and Scotland were originally lands that belonged to them, but all the other tribes(Vikings, Saxons, Celtic, other Germanic tribes, French rulers, and so on) started to settle down and 'took it away' from them, therefore all these folks and the current royal family whose ancestors are from the German Saxe Coburg and Gotha living in the region for thousands of years are merely 'perpetrators' and do not have any right to claim the land, live on the land, or to resist or to play victim even when their land gets militarily occupied for nearly a century. 

The reason I said this is because we need to accept that both Jews and Arabs have the right to call it their homeland. But Israelis must acknowledge the truth of how the foundation of their nation caused hundreds of thousands of refugees, how their militaries led them to expulsion, how they tried to ethnically cleansed all arabs to win arabs, how after 1967 six days war, they have been expanding settlements, blocking goods, treating people poorly, thus getting them weaker and weaker day by day, how they made peace treaty with Egypt and Jordan while still occupying Southern Lebanon, how their prime ministers insisted during negotiations with UN that there would be no Palestinian state, how they agreed on the interim periods of PNA's limited governance of its people, but deliberately avoided completing 'the final settlement' on giving them complete freedom. 

I feel disgusted. 
However, I admit that I feel disgusted by the terror and unimaginable atrocities caused by Hamas as well, yet I'm even more disgusted by Netanyahu, his administration, and the people of Israel never ADMITTING what they've done and what they are doing, how they've crossed the line, how many innocent lives they took, how many more innocent lives they'll take regardless of where the real attackers lie, their ongoing war crimes, and decades of illegal occupation. 

All I want for now is that Israel, at least, is aware of these instead of brainwashing the world and foolishly believing that its leader Netanyahu does have an acutal end goal."

(This has nothing to do with the past, for the purposes of this post the past does not exist)

I would have left it there but apparently there is a length requirement‚Ä¶

An airborn offer of peace may not go well, so perhaps some clearly marked ground vehicles. If this thing got attacked it would be interesting. 


Seems like a good idea to try something new and to do so on the world stage and the first day of the new year. 

Is the NATO world hoping Israel starts to attack Iran? Other countries can attack Iran if they like I guess. 

Isn‚Äôt this whole attack counter attack proportional not proportional game a bit odd?

I suppose a counterargument would be that this is a show of weakness. Intercepting all or nearly all incoming missiles twice would seem be a show of strength. 

I am at a loss for another counterargument. My mind can be changed. 

On a related note I would like to make a case for the value of honest dialogue between people. 

Honesty is difficult when there is fear.  We should strive for a world in which fear is truly vestigial, like an appendix or a gallbladder. 

There is much to be concerned with, yet nothing to fear.

Is it possible I am still not at the character limit?  This brings me to my final and maybe most important point. Everything is way too long and bloated. Think about what a bill in the US government looks like compared to the constitution. Think about every self help book and every other book. 

Why do we value bloat?  Why am I supposed to reach a 1500 character limit to ask a simple question?  

It is an honest question. Good day.

1g2lprn,Biden recently announced that an assassination attempt on Trump by Iran would constitute an act of war.,2024-10-13 09:14:08,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g2lprn/biden_recently_announced_that_an_assassination/,"Here is the [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/11/trump-security-threats-iran-election-2024-campaign/).

It makes you wonder what the US would do if 1000 of its citizens were murdered in one day. Would its response be ‚Äúproportional‚Äù and would it should restraint?

Related: Many folks reading this weren‚Äôt around in 1991 but let me tell you what happened when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. The US joined an international effort to push Iraq back to the border. Israel of course was one of many countries that sided with the US.

Of all the countries that opposed Iraq, which one was attacked with SCUD missile attacks on its large population centres? Only Israel. They started attacking Israel the same day the international defense efforts began. [Link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Iraqi_missile_attacks_against_Israel#:~:text=Throughout%20the%20entire%20Gulf%20War,January%20to%2023%20February%201991).

Wouldn‚Äôt any country consider that an act of war? Of course. The US pleaded with Israel not to respond and it obliged. The rationale was that many Arab countries opposed the invasion and that if Israel got involved it would divide their support.

And that conflict had little to do with Palestinians (at that point).

How tolerant has Israel been of attacks on its citizens? How much does Israel need to bear?

This statement from Biden is completely reasonable, and it makes the standards to which the international community holds Israel completely unreasonable. No one would be asking the US ‚Äúbut *why* would someone attack‚Äù, or ‚Äúlet‚Äôs look at the bigger picture‚Äù. "

Leader of the Quds Force (Iran's CIA), successor to Qassem Soleimani, was in Lebanon when the attack on Safieddine happened and nothing was heard of him afterwards, not even from his family according to rumors. Many suggested he was killed in the airstrikes.  

Then Iran says he's in good health. Many start suspecting he's the israeli spy all along, since he would have exceptional knowledge on all hezbollah activities and locations. Iran says he will make an appearance shortly.

Then he becomes under investigation for security breaches, and rumors say he suffered a heart attack. These heart attack rumors are later dispelled by Iran.   

Then what? No one knows. If he is an israeli agent, did israel take him in and iran is just saying what it's saying to save face? If iran actually got him and investigating for breaches, did he really have a ""heart attack"", quite the coincidence?

He is a very important figure in hezbollah, known to many Lebanese as the key obstructor in bringing justice to august 4 beirut port explosion victims by threatening the judge to not continue his case as he was calling upon hezbollah MPs to answer his summons. There was a lot of speculation this was Hezbollah's storage. Whether true or not, it is clear he threatened the judge and obstructed any judiciary action from taking place.

He was targeted in an attack on two different buildings which housed over a hundred citizens. This attacked killed many innocents as well.  

Hezbollah initially said he survived the attack, some sources even said he wasn't even at the site of the attack. Many hezb supporters rejoiced.   

Then sources say he's in critical condition. And ever since, I couldn't find any official news source about his condition, but many on twitter are claiming he's dead and a photo is being circulated of his corpse as well. Yet no official news source is even mentioning him anymore.

The likely successor to Nasrallah, targeted in a huge attack even bigger than the one that killed Nasrallah.   

It's been over a week and there has been no confirmation of his death. Israel says they likely killed him but hezbollah refused to say so. Is he alive? If not, why are they taking so long to say he died, they waited for Nasrallah but not nearly as long.

So what's the issue now? Why is there a lack of reportage on the recent assassination attempts. Even Israel used to be more vocal about their successful attempts.  "

Bezalel Smotrich, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and even Netanyahu himself are dragging Israel down a path that echoes some of the darkest ideologies from World War II. Their words aren‚Äôt just alarming‚Äîthey‚Äôre paving the way for ethnic supremacy, territorial conquest, and brutal oppression. If anyone still supports these politicians, they‚Äôre turning a blind eye to an ideology rooted in violence and hate.

Smotrich? He‚Äôs out here talking about wiping Palestinian villages like Huwwara off the map. He‚Äôs also pushing for a ‚ÄúGreater Israel‚Äù that extends all the way to Damascus, swallowing up Syria, Jordan, and beyond. This isn‚Äôt just nationalist bluster‚Äîit‚Äôs fascist expansionism, plain and simple. When you call for erasing entire towns and populations, you‚Äôre not promoting security or peace, you‚Äôre advocating for ethnic cleansing.

Itamar Ben-Gvir is no better. A convicted racist, Ben-Gvir believes Jewish settlers in the West Bank should have more rights than Palestinians, going so far as to say his ‚Äúright to life‚Äù comes before anyone else‚Äôs basic freedoms. His views are apartheid in all but name. This isn‚Äôt some fringe lunatic either‚Äîhe‚Äôs in a position of power, with real influence. And Netanyahu?

Other figures, like Aryeh Deri and Avigdor Lieberman, are piling on with their own toxic rhetoric.

Return of all Palestinian refugees

Supervision by the United Nations of free and fair elections on the first and second occasions

Removal of weapons of mass destruction from the state (which IMO unlikely given the axis of resistance) 

Recognition of the state by the Arab League (which is weird given its also Jewish)

1g29dd8,The Dahiya Doctrine ,2024-10-12 20:42:28,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g29dd8/the_dahiya_doctrine/,"Hi, so recently I watched [this](https://x.com/ryanrozbiani/status/1844769936784155005?s=46) video on the internet.

Obviously the video pushes a certain narrative, but I would like to dig deeper into why exactly many of these points may be true or untrue.

He refers to the IDF as the IOF, and the Israel Hamas war as a genocide, both highly charged statements, but I was wondering if these claims about the dahiya doctrine, and to what extent it is applied. 

Specifically: 

The normalization of killing civilians in Israel as a metric of military success.

The actual application of the dahiya doctrine.

Israeli military doctrine that calls for the use of massive, disproportionate force and the deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure. This is to put pressure on resistance groups by making Civilians unhappy with it.  

> What happened in the Dahieh quarter of Beirut in 2006 will happen in every village from which shots will be fired in the direction of Israel. We will wield disproportionate power and cause immense damage and destruction. From our perspective, these are military bases. [‚Ä¶] This isn‚Äôt a suggestion. It‚Äôs a plan that has already been authorized. [‚Ä¶] Every one of the Shiite villages is a military site, with headquarters, an intelligence center, and a communications center. Dozens of rockets are buried in houses, basements, attics, and the village is run by Hezbollah men. In each village, according to its size, there are dozens of active members, the local residents, and alongside them fighters from outside, and everything is prepared and planned both for a defensive battle and for firing missiles at Israel. [‚Ä¶] Hezbollah understands well that its fire from within villages will lead to their destruction. Before Nasrallah gives the order to fire at Israel, he will need to think 30 times if he wants to destroy his support base in the villages. This is not a theoretical matter for him. The possibility of harm to the population is the main factor restraining Nasrallah, and the reason for the quiet in the last two years.

I always give people the benefit of the doubt, so if someone could explain if the research he laid out has any basis to it, despite his political leanings. "
1g29cuv,What the UNIFIL can/cannot do,2024-10-12 20:41:50,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g29cuv/what_the_unifil_cancannot_do/,"So, the IDF has fired upon UNIFIL Location. There is no question about who shot it (Israel force), what shot it (Merkava tank). But of course, there are a lot of ""discussion"" and ""debate"" about what the UNIFIL force can and cannot do, regardless of what people think the ""common sense"" is:

""UNIFIL didn't tell Israel about Hezbollah rocket attacks"". Duh, they are not supposed to. The UNIFIL is a NEUTRAL force, so warning one side about the other side's attack kinda breaks NEUTRAL part of ""neutrality"". UNIFIL also doesn't answer to Israel, they answer to the security council. they REPORT, not ""stop"", violations in a report sent to the UN secretary every four months. The report can be read online on their website, so there is no ""favoring"" one side or the other. they don't report live violations because OBVIOUSLY that is live intel that could be used by both sides, because they are, again, neutral.

""UNIFIL should have left when Israel told them to do so"". Again, the UNIFIL DOESN'T answer to the IDF, the UNIFIL answers to the security council, specifically the mandates. UNIFIL forces in on a UN mandate, and unless the mandate is ended with a majority vote on the security council, or a new mandate, by the security council, tell them to change where they station, they don't leave the area they are in. Again, if the UNIFIL takes orders from the IDF, because that would be helping one side, breaking the NEUTRALITY

""Because UNIFIL didn't move, they shouldn't be surprised that they were shot at"". That is not how it works, that is not how ANY of it works. The IDF ORDERING the UNIFIL to leave is already a violation of the mandate, and tell me if I'm crazy, but there is no provision in ANY of the mandates that say, ""UN bases are freebie if the UNIFIL doesn't take your order"".

""They should have done something because paragraph 12 authorized them to use force"". Yes, only in 2 specific situations: 1. protecting themselves from attack and 2. protecting civilians. Paragraph 12 AND paragraph 8 specifically say that outside of those 2 situations, they specifically need the REQUEST OF THE LEBANESE government. So far, the Lebanese government has not requested anything, so of course, the UNIFIL is not doing anything

BTW, considering the ""self defense part"", the UNIFIL have more right to fire upon IDF forces because the IDF has fired directly at them.

""The UNIFIL is useless, why are they even here if they don't STOP violations"" again, they don't stop violations, they REPORT them. And what EXACTLY are people saying this EXPECT UNIFIL to DO? There are roughly 10000 UNIFIL personels, half of whom are in the naval division, so land attacks are kinda out of their purview. The army division doesn't have ANY tanks, ANY air fighters, or ANY heavy artillery, they are not sent to Lebanon as an ENFORCEMENT division, but a monitoring and humanitarian (and security for said humanitarian) groups. they are only armed to the barest necessary amount to ""accomplish"" those goals. If anyone wants to complain about it, then they should have complained to the FORMATION of the UN, because the five security councils with veto created it so UN forces have no standing military of its own (they can ignore them if they break any rules)."

1g1x39t,On how outsiders are polarized and don't consider the possibility of grassroots solutions like those of Standing Together,2024-10-12 10:18:31,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g1x39t/on_how_outsiders_are_polarized_and_dont_consider/,"Greetings everyone!

I would like to start as a quick disclaimer, I'm a member of a pan-European party Volt. Discussions on Israel-Palestine conflict happen often and in order to help its members have a better understanding (and non-polarizing) stance on the conflict, they organized weeks ago a dialogue with the organization Standing Together (link to the video at the end).

I would like to say this discussion was incredibly illuminating for outsiders. From what one gathers from social media, opinions are too polarized, giving you the sense that no compromise is ever possible. Organizations like Standing Together, even if they might be a minority voice, prove otherwise: dialogue and reform are possible. In this case inside Israel, but there is absolutely no way they can't happen inside Palestine, too.

Now, I obviously don't want to romanticize how easy a compromise and reforms in both sides would be. They will certainly be very hard. But at the very least, these indigenous grassroots organizations show to people living (often comfortably) miles and miles away, like me in Europe, that our views of what kinds of peace are possible are flawed or shortsighted. Because in the end, long-lasting peace will have to be made and uphold by people in the ground, not crafted by someone far away. And among those people in the ground, there are many that indeed what peace, way more strongly than we can ever wish for.

This might have much influence on the conflict itself, but I think to us, outsiders, these movements should serve as a reality-check. Even if our (sometimes radical) stances on the conflict are taken with the best intentions, they are not everything there is and, with millions of people affected, there is not necessarily just two sides of a barricade. It's fine to take stances, but we need to make an effort to depolarize our speech; disagree with others, but do so respectfully; and above all, be willing to accept that we might not be fully right.

Please, do let me know your thoughts on how outsiders view the conflict and if you think the style we engage (often online) in these debates has any impact (positive or nefarious) on it.

1g1m8rj,A Diplomatic Proposal for a Phased Ceasefire ,2024-10-11 22:45:37,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g1m8rj/a_diplomatic_proposal_for_a_phased_ceasefire/,"**Purpose:** To propose a framework for a rapid and sustainable cessation of violence in the Middle East.

**Positionality:**¬† I am a gay Jewish white man living in the Midwest of the United States. I lived in Israel for a year, around 2005, and I currently have family living there.

**Assumptions:**¬† To have this discussion, I need to make some assumptions about the situation.¬† While people may disagree with them, I don‚Äôt think debating them right now will likely increase the chances of a lasting peace plan. These assumptions are as follows.

1. All sides feel that they are in the right. All sides think that the other side has not negotiated in good faith, and they have historical grievances that must be addressed. However, the purpose of this proposal is not to redress all historical wrongs but to specifically de-escalate the current violence starting on October 7th, 2023.
2. All sides believe that they have the legitimate right to contested lands.
3. Any long-term solution that depends on the eradication, removal, or permanent displacement of the Jewish State of Israel or the Palestinian people is not acceptable.
4. Civilian lives matter.¬† The intentional murder, rape, or hostage-taking of civilians is not legitimate resistance or retaliation, regardless of the perceived oppression, grievance, or situation that inspires it.
5. Civilian casualties are an unavoidable consequence of armed conflict.¬† All parties should make an effort to minimize civilian casualties following international law and ensure that any risk of civilian casualties is proportional to the legitimate military purpose of an action.
6. All parties have an obligation to make a clear distinction between armed belligerents and civilians.¬† No party should place their military equipment, combatants, or weapons in close proximity to, underneath, or within residential areas/buildings, healthcare facilities, schools, or other non-military facilities.¬† If they choose to do so, they have an obligation to inform the civilian populace within their vicinity and have ultimate responsibility for any harm to civilians that occurs due to interventions against those targets.¬† This does not override assumptions 4 and 5.
7. While all parties have a right to self-defense and armed resistance, any long-term peace will require a diplomatic solution and compromises on all sides.
8. Peace is possible.

While the current conflict zones are connected, they are separate conflicts requiring separate diplomatic solutions.¬† Below is my proposal for a phased end to conflict for each of the current theaters.

**Gaza and the West Bank:**

Assessment: This is the conflict that started the other conflicts.¬† My focus on this is to end the current violence while acknowledging that a permanent solution is likely a problematic long-term process.¬† I think it is essential for all future conflicts in the world that hostage-taking not be rewarded, and so I believe proof of life and release of hostages must be a central element of the initial phases. The conflict in the West Bank has changed the least since October 7th.¬† I think the priority here is to establish principles of mutual respect between responsible governing parties and to prevent escalation from spreading.¬† I think it is important that Israel make significant concessions, including and especially concerning redressing settlement expansion and settler violence in this area. Independent progress towards peace in the West Bank can serve as a model to ease the transition to peaceful democratic governance in Gaza.

Diplomatic Proposal:

1. Phase ¬†
   1. Gaza
      1. Duration: This phase will last one week regardless of whether it is kept or violated. If kept, it will proceed to Phase 2 after one week.¬† If it is violated, then hostilities will resume after the one-week period.
      2. Immediate cessation of mortar, rocket, missile attacks, and air strikes within Gaza and originating from Gaza.¬† Israel and belligerents within Gaza will be expected to follow this stipulation for the duration of phase one, even if their opponents do not.
      3. Cessation of all new ground operations within Gaza or originating from Gaza. Military forces remain in their current positions.
      4. Neutral international parties (NIPs), such as the International Red Cross, will be allowed access to all prisoners and hostages held by either party to confirm their current status and administer necessary medical attention.¬†¬†
      5. Failure to allow access to prisoners or hostages within one week will be a violation of the phase one cease-fire. It will be just grounds to resume hostilities at the end of phase one.
      6. All deceased prisoners or hostages will be identified and verified by NIPs. When possible, remains will be released to NIPs for return and burials by their families.¬†¬†
      7. Failure to allow access to and identification of deceased prisoners or hostages will be a violation of the phase one cease-fire. It will be just grounds to resume hostilities at the end of phase one.
   2. West Bank
      1. The Palestinian Authority issues an unequivocal condemnation of terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians and agrees to a permanent rejection of future kidnapping, hostage taking, infiltration attacks, or other attacks targeting civilians, transportation, entertainment, religious, or other non-military infrastructure in Israel. This is widely published in English and Arabic.
      2. The Israeli war cabinet issues an unequivocal condemnation of terrorist attacks against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank carried out by Israeli settlers (or any other non-state actors) and agrees to a permanent rejection of future non-state violence against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank. This is widely published in English, Arabic, and Hebrew.
      3. Cessation of all Israeli air strikes and ground operations in the West Bank.
      4. Cessation of all attacks originating from the West Bank.
      5. Withdrawal of Israeli forces from Area A in line with Oslo accords.
2. Phase 2¬†
   1. Duration: This phase will last until it is completed or violated.
   2. Release of all Israeli and international hostages or prisoners being held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
      1. Each Israeli prisoner or hostage release will be followed by a release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel within 24 hours.
      2. The Palestinian prisoners released will have a minimum ratio of three (3) Palestinians to every one (1) Israeli or international prisoner/hostage released in the proceeding 24-hour period.
      3. At least 10 Israeli and international hostages and/or prisoners will be released per day until all Israeli and international hostages or prisoners within Gaza have been returned to their families.
      4. Each party may decide whom they are releasing on a given day as long as they meet the required quantity.
      5. Failure of belligerents in Gaza to release at least 10 Israeli or International prisoners or hostages per day until all are released will be a violation of the phase 2 cease-fire. It will be just grounds to resume hostilities if not corrected within an additional 24 hours.
      6. Failure of belligerents in Israel to release Palestinian prisoners, as described in this section, will be a violation of the Phase 2 cease-fire. It will be just grounds to resume hostilities if not corrected within an additional 24 hours.
      7. Removal of all Israeli settlers, settlements, or other Israeli-aligned non-state actors in areas A and B of the West Bank in line with the Oslo Accords.
   3. The immediate return of the remains of any deceased Israeli or international hostage/prisoners not already returned during phase 1.

**Lebanon**¬†

Assessment: Prior to October 7th, the conflict in Lebanon was mostly contained but was never compliant with UN Resolutions 1701 and 1559.¬† The escalation on October 8th by Hezbollah in support of Hamas brought Lebanon into the conflict against the will of either the Israeli or Lebanese governments. While UN Security Council Resolutions 1701 and 1559 can offer a framework, a solution to the current conflict requires recognition of the decision of Hezbollah not to comply with these resolutions, the failure of UNIFIL and the Lebanese government to enforce compliance, and the changes in the situation on the ground following as a result of recent direct conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.¬†

Diplomatic Proposal

1. Phase 1
   1. Cessation of Israeli airstrikes North of the Awali River.
   2. Cessation of all rocket, missile, mortar, or other attacks toward Israeli or international targets originating from Lebanon.
   3. Withdrawal of all belligerent forces not belonging to the Lebanese or Israeli government from the territory between the Blue Line and the Awali River.
2. Phase 2
   1. Withdrawal of Israeli forces to the Blue Line as enforced on October 6th, 2023, with Israeli control of the contested Shebaa Farms area being recognized as being compliant with this agreement.
   2. Cessation of all air strikes in Lebanese territory contingent on continued cessation of all missile, rocket, mortar, infiltration, or other attacks originating from Lebanese territory.
   3. Israeli and Lebanese civilians will be allowed to return to their homes.
   4. All weapon systems located between the Blue Line and the Awali River will be surrendered for destruction to a joint force of UNIFIL, the Lebanese Army, and Israeli observers.
   5. This same joint force will ensure the destruction of all Hezbollah tunnels or other militant infrastructure located on or beneath the territory between the Awali River and the Blue Line.
   6. Any location between the Awali River and the Blue Line that is believed to contain weapons, serve a militant purpose, or have military infrastructure beneath it will be investigated by a joint force of UNIFIL, the Lebanese Army, and Israeli observers within one week of the time it is reported to the UN Peacekeeping Force.
   7. Failure to demilitarize or refusing to allow safe access to UN Peacekeeping Force investigations will be a violation of the Phase 2 ceasefire and, if not redressed in a reasonable time, will be just grounds to resume hostilities.
3. Phase 3
   1. Complete disarmament of non-state military forces in Lebanon and transition to full Lebanese sovereignty in accordance with UN resolutions 1559 and 1701.
   2. The UN Security Council will provide the authorization and the obligation for UNIFIL to use force against non-state actors to maintain compliance with resolutions 1559 and 1701.¬†
   3. Negotiation of mutual recognition, permanent peace treaty, and free civilian trade between Lebanon and Israel.
   4. International funding for reconstruction and joint economic ventures between Israel and Lebanon.
4. Phase 4
   1. Lebanese citizenship, with financial support from Israel and international donors to the Lebanese government, will be offered to any Palestinian refugee or their descendant currently living in Lebanon who voluntarily wishes to permanently and peacefully resettle in Lebanon.
   2. Support for voluntary repatriation to the Gaza Strip or West Bank for Palestinian refugees or their descendants living in Lebanon. (Pending completion of Phase 4 of the Gaza Section and the West Bank ceasefire, respectively.)

**Yemen**

Assessment - I think this is the most one-sided theater in the current conflict.¬† Israel has no interest in any conflict with Yemen or the Houthis, and the form of Houthi resistance has predominantly been unprovoked attacks against international shipping with minimal connection to Israel.¬† I think the primary solution to this conflict is a unified global response.

Diplomatic Proposal

1. Phase 1 -¬†
   1. Joint declaration that any further attacks originating from Yemen against civilian targets flagged in, originating from, traveling to, or crewed by citizens of NATO or EU nations will be viewed as attacks against NATO and the EU, respectively.
   2. Joint declaration that any naval assets supporting Houthi attacks on civilian shipping will be considered legitimate targets under international anti-piracy laws.
2. Phase 2 -¬†
   1. Immediate cessation of all Israeli attacks on targets in Yemen.
   2. Immediate cessation of all attacks originating from Yemen on international shipping.
   3. Immediate cessation of all missile and drone attacks against the State of Israel originating from Yemen.
3. Phase 3
   1. Negotiation of permanent peace settlement and disarmament of non-state actors through international mediation.¬† This does not need to include Israel as long as all parties maintain Phase 2 conditions.
4. Phase 4¬†
   1. Mutual recognition, permanent peace treaty, and civilian trade agreement between Israel and the government of Yemen.

**Iraq and Syria**

Assessment:¬† The current escalation in conflict here is predominantly secondary to Iranian Proxy Forces, although the Assad regime in Syria certainly has historical animosity towards Israel. I focus primarily on responding to the current escalation, but long-term peace will likely require the resolution of long-standing issues.

Diplomatic Proposal:

1. Phase 1
   1. Cessation of all attacks against Israeli, US, and international targets by non-state actors.
2. Phase 2
   1. Withdrawal of all IRGC, Hezbollah, and other Iranian-backed forces from Iraqi and Syrian territory.
   2. Surrender or destruction of all Iranian, Hezbollah, and non-state weapon systems within Iraqi and Syrian territory.
   3. Commitment from Iraqi and Syrian government forces not to engage in any direct attacks on Israeli targets.
   4. Permanent cessation of all Israeli strikes in Iraqi and Syrian territory contingent on continued compliance with the other requirements of the Phase 2 cease-fire.
3. Phase 3
   1. Mutual recognition of the October 6th, 2023 border between Syria and Israel as the basis for future treaties, which includes Israeli control of the Golan Heights.
4. Phase 4
   1. Negotiation of permanent peace treaty, mutual recognition, and civilian trade between Iraq, Syria, and Israel."
1g1kloy,Judaism Vs Islamism,2024-10-11 21:28:33,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g1kloy/judaism_vs_islamism/,"The deeper we've moved into the current conflict, the more this has become a single track Jews Vs Islamism issue. Watching from the side lines with an opinion (there are plenty who don't have a clue nor care), there consists those who sympathise with the Jews and those who see the Islamists as victims. It's a clear divide and those that fall in the middle seem not to have a voice nor want one. The 'progressive' left has single mindedly taken up the Islamist cause with fervour, because they've wholesale swallowed the narrative that Israel is to blame for everything at all times. The pro Israel side point blame the other way, although there are distinct voices differentiating between Palestinians and Islamists. Sometimes that line is blurred but it's acknowledged. 

There are some very simple truths that Israel haters and/or Jew haters, conveniently swerve and I'm certain that the Jews are being gaslit by the Islamic world and its support base. Or a word I've coined that better covers gaslighting a whole race and nation, Masslit. 

If we look at some global evidence to unpick the Jewish Vs Islamism question, it's interesting that no one on the anti-Jew left pick up on the fact that Jews have not provided the world with fundamentalist terrorists, hate filled preachers, death cults, banning of homosexuality and the culture of martyrdom. No evidence of Jews wanting to colonise the world and push it's teachings onto all. All religion is regressive by it's very nature. But Judaism is pro life, pro self growth, entrepreneurship, graft, family support and respect. Islamism less so. Judaism does not push it's own agenda onto others. Islamism, less so. 

Israel, as the only safe haven for Jews, faces Islamist extermination from all fronts. It's not a persecution complex when you've literally been persecuted for 1000s of years. Not surprising that Israelis then (only narrowly) vote in a right wing government. 

Hamas not only provoked the war, with it's sub human bestial attack, but does EVERYTHING it can to inflict Palestinian deaths. Why? Why would a death cult that believes in martyrdom let it's own people perish, you may ask? That's inconceivable. Because it's great marketing. It's the best PR money (rockets) can buy. Letting your own people be killed by putting them in harms way, is great digital marketing. The GoPros were nothing compared to the Gazan death reports. Don't let your people use bomb shelters after provoking a war into your yard and use their homes, schools and hospitals as strongholds. Marketing at it's peak.

But didn't Israel just create the death cults Hamas and Hezbollah? Sure. There's no way a death cult that wants to create an islamic caliphate could be created without it being the fault of Jews. Isis, Al Qaida, Boko Harem. Must have been coz Israel. 

Why did Israel create the Iron Dome and mandate every home has a shelter or safe room? They're pro life. 

Why are most Israeli Arabs so pro Israel? They feel protected. They feel community. 

How do all the Jews in Gaza, Ramallah, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Egypt feel? All three of them? 

So next time you hear shouts of 'genocide' aimed squarely at Israelis and/ or Jews know that the intentional Holocaust vernacular is the signifier of masslighting. 



Edit:


I'm seeing an interesting trend off the back of this. 

Those who are Israel supporters are agreeing that this is about religion or at least, that lies at the core. 

Those who are against the Jewish state are saying that this isn't about religion, it's just about land. 

Perhaps by denying this is about religion, it makes it so much easier to rationalise. "

I spent hours on wikipedia collecting notes and then reduced them into this summary. I know its missing a lot of historical and cultural context, and I attempted to avoid including information that might be considered subjective. It is intentionally simplified in the interest of brevity. -- my notes are more comprehensive but this is a distillation of what I find to be the most salient points required to for a minimal contextual understanding of conflict. 

*  ‚¶ø 1936 ‚Äì The Peel Commission proposes to allocate 80% of the disputed territory to Palestine and 20% to Israel; the offer is accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by Arab leaders.

* ‚¶ø 1947 ‚Äì The United Nations proposes to allocate 42% to Palestine, 56% to Israel; Jewish leaders accept, Arab leaders reject. Israel is founded the following year, largely based on the proposal.
 
* ‚¶ø 1948 ‚Äì Israel successfully defends against an invasion by a coalition of Arab states, expanding its territory beyond what it was allocated by the UN. The war causes displacement of almost 1 million Palestinians, which is considered the beginning of the present day Israeli-Palestinian conflict; as well the beginning of the mass-exodus of Jews from the neighboring Arab states.
 
* ‚¶ø 1967 ‚Äì Egypt leads a coalition of Arab countries with the goal of exterminating Israel. The ‚ÄúSix Day War‚Äù begins when Israel preemptively attacks Egypt in response to a military blockade, and ends with Israel taking coalition territories from three neighboring states.
 
* ‚¶ø 2000 - United States hosted the Camp David Summit, where Palestinians rejected a proposal, citing unfair allocation of lands and failing to satisfy their essential requirements. 
* The following decades are characterized by regular attacks by terrorists against Israel, with Israel‚Äôs counter-terrorism policies sparking significant domestic and international criticism for its impact on Palestinian civilians and the broader conflict.

I would appreciate any feedback, and especially would love for people to help me fill in any essential gaps in my understanding. Thank you!

Edit: Thank you all for the feedback! I'm legit surprised at how many people had genuinely helpful contributions because I see a lot of uninformed people with really strong opinions supporting one side or the other everywhere on reddit. 

At this point, I have a hard time explaining the historical, cultural, and religious motivations of the Arab side pre-1948 concisely. It seems really odd that they would just have it out for the Jews with no desire at all to coexist."

Hezbollah themselves have finally separated their issue from the gaza issue, they agreed to disregard their previous claim that the war will continue as long as the war in gaza continues. They no longer hold that position.  

Israel has achieved extraordinary victories by assassinating nearly all of hezbollahs leadership and a huge amount of their weapons. But the most important part is they have made hezbollah weak politically as well, many Lebanese turned against them because of hezbollah starting this war while Lebanon is already suffering.  

However, the longer Israel continues this war, the more the civilian losses and the more hatred brews against them. Yesterday they toppled a whole building in a very densely populated area in central Beirut (outside dahyeh, in an area that was considered safe). There has already been over 20 deaths and over 100 injured, and these are people who are literally innocent. There's families in these buildings unrelated to hezbollah.  

There's also the attacks on paramedics, UNIFIL forces, and the Lebanese army.  

What is Israel's end goal? When will this end? Will more civilians need to die? The collateral is becoming too high and the benefit too small.

1g15n8j,"For those in the U.S. who are choosing not to vote for Harris in the election due Gaza, could you explain what you see as the endgame of this move?",2024-10-11 09:15:21,101,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g15n8j/for_those_in_the_us_who_are_choosing_not_to_vote/,"So, I am from the other side of the Atlantic, but I have my social media flooded by the US election anyway. 

Among this flood, I often see people saying that they will not vote for democrats, because of the situation in the Middle East. There are even videos like [this](https://x.com/Lis_Smith/status/1843302682234437905) appearing, with a fairly well-known socialist politician Kshama Sawant calling on people to vote for Jill Stein in order to deny Harris victory in Michigan. 

Now, I understand why they dislike Harris. That is not so difficult. But I have a real trouble understanding what is the endgame here. You achieve to get Trump elected, make things worse in the US from your viewpoint and not help the Middle East one bit. Probably actually even harm the Middle East more. 

What do you expect to happen? If it is a reversal of the Democratic policy towards Israel for the future elections, why do you think it is likely? 

My understanding is that there are cca. 7.5 million Jews in the US, most of which are both sympathetic to Israel and Democrat leaning. Moreover, there are significant Jewish populations in the swing states like Pennsylvania (much larger than a typical winning margin). Why do you believe that there is enough votes to secure a victory for an Israel-skeptical candidate in 2028 or 2032? 

I am asking this question in good faith. While I am personally supportive of Israel (albeit not much its current government), I am not judging you for this decision in any way. However, as the US internal politics have a major impact on the rest of the world as well, I just want to understand the driving force behind this possibly election-changing movement. "

This is not to say I don‚Äôt have my gripes with what Israel does as well as gripes with its government.

Something that I‚Äôve been struggling to comprehend for a while now is, and while I know it is technically a vocal minority that the media is covering, why so many people seem to so aggressively support the idea of a ‚ÄúFree Palestine‚Äù through Hamas and the destruction of the Jewish state. I‚Äôve seen so much hate and so much information and misinformation which is either extremely biased or blatantly wrong to make Israel look bad. I‚Äôm not against the idea of a sovereign Palestinian state, I‚Äôm sure most Jews and Israelis would agree in that manner, but what I don‚Äôt get is why do people try to make things seem so clean cut in todays society despite it just not really being like that? I‚Äôve discussed this with people before, and like I said I have my issues with Israel and its government, but I feel like if anything in this is black and white then it‚Äôs that Hamas is a terrorist organization and Israel is responding to a terrorist attack. To put it simply, I don‚Äôt think Israel-Hamas is very complicated. Rather I think it‚Äôs very straight forward. But on the other hand I‚Äôd consider Israel-Palestine a very complicated topic with deep history between both sides with incredibly valid points, and yet people seem to just ignore one or the other and just say that this is or isn‚Äôt the truth and I just don‚Äôt get it.

Maybe I‚Äôm just being too sensitive but I don‚Äôt understand why people are acting the way they are and I can‚Äôt say I necessarily hate people who claim to be pro Palestine or stuff like that I just want to know why, but it seems like the majority of those who proclaim themselves as such aren‚Äôt willing to sit down and talk about it.

Illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank are immoral and should be seceded. Settler violence is very real and is just as important of an issue as violence coming from Gaza and the West Bank. 

Claims:

Evidence: Long term hatred of Jews as shown in pogroms and genocide throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa for the last 2000 years. Anti-Jewish blood libel, propaganda, and conspiracy theories that are resurfacing as more and more normalized. 

- Historically, Muslims and Arabs have been perpetrators of vastly disproportional amounts of violence towards Jews much more than the other way around up to WW1. They started it, not the Jews. 

Evidence: Too much to list. More than happy to attach when pressed. 

- Israel has very much a right to exist as a safe haven for Jewish people but also has the moral responsibility to treat non Jews including Muslims as equal citizens within all facets of life within Israel. 

Evidence: Historical persecution of Jews has left them with minimal choice but to have a dedicated safe haven that Jews can exist without hindrance from anyone.

* 12/6/23: Israel has said that a 2:1 ratio of civilians to militants killed is [tremendously positive](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/middleeast/israel-hamas-military-civilian-ratio-killed-intl-hnk/index.html). Other estimates may differ slightly or be more recent, but I'm not sure what the most accurate one is.

**Hamas**

* 10/7/23: Hamas killed 795 civilians and 375 security forces for a ratio of 2.1:1. It is unclear what the ratio is for hostages taken so I will not include those.
* 10/7/24: An additional 347 Israeli security forces have been killed in Gaza. If we attribute all these deaths to Hamas (some were accidents / friendly fire), then Hamas' civlian casualty ratio goes down to 1:1.

It is inherently much more difficult to calculate israel's civilian casuality because of the indiscriminate nature in which Israel is bombing Gaza, however, there is some evidence that Hamas has waged its war in a way that more specifically targets security forces vs. civilians.

My question for this group:

1. Do you agree that it is likely that Hamas has a much lower civilian casualty ratio (1:1 vs 2:1) than Israel or do you know additional information that would change these calculations substantially?
2. If Hamas has been more successful than Israel at targeting security forces over civilians, and we are characterizing Israel's ratio as ""tremendously positive,"" how would we then characterize Hamas' ratio? Would we call it ""outstandingly positive?"""
1g0v2ph,"After 10 days in Lebanon, what has the IDF achieved?",2024-10-10 22:30:23,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g0v2ph/after_10_days_in_lebanon_what_has_the_idf_achieved/,"Short answer: Not much  
Long answer: The IDF has entered South Lebanon on 4 axes with 4 divisions totaling roughly 40,000 men (the same amount as the 2006 war). However, besides occupying only the outskirts of Lebanese border villages (which are lightly defended by Hezbollah border troops), the IDF still has failed to fully control even 1 village. Despite the IDF's media hype and released the footage, it is vastly overblown and doesn't reflect fully the reality on the ground. Curiously, the IDF has adopted a more cautious slow approach, relying more on ground troops, air strikes, and lightly armored vehicles instead of tanks and going in guns blazing (like in Gaza). This is a reflection of the IDF learning its lesson from the 2006 war with Hezbollah and focusing more on conserving casualties

**The Israeli Plan**

As you all know, the 2024 Israeli invasion of South Lebanon has begun. On October 1st, Israel launched a ""limited ground operation"" inside South Lebanon to create a short buffer zone to destroy Hezbollah launch sites and deter future Hezbollah attacks. This shift comes after the IDF has focused more on its attention with dealing Hezbollah in the North rather than with Hamas in the South.

Interestingly, the current Israel operation and sources from Israeli media suggest Israel doesn't want to fully occupy South Lebanon all the way up to the Litani (which would be the status quo of South Lebanon before 2000 i.e. under Israeli occupation). From the way Israel has painted the operation and what Israeli media has stated online, Israel is trying to play a delicate balance between not fully occupying the region but also creating a buffer zone just good enough to prevent future Hezbollah attacks.

It's not hard to see why. Israel doesn't want to be in charge of the entire region of South Lebanon, a region which cost the country billions of dollars back when it occupied it and led to many casualties and deaths. It led to a 20-year old decades conflict between the IDF and an early Hezbollah, from which Israel didn't gain much. In short, the costs far outweigh the benefits. However, Israel is also not going to fully surrender the region. The IDF plan so far seems to be creating a 5-10 km buffer zone from the Israeli border which (according to the IDF) would be sufficient to prevent attacks on Northern Israel. It would be akin to a mini-occupation of South Lebanon, not quite as extensive and costly as the previous one, but just big enough to prevent attacks. Another aspect of the Israeli plan seems to be ""limited small-scale"" raids into Lebanese villages to search and destroy Hezbollah launch sites. Rather than a full-scale invasion, Israel wants to send in just enough troops and to deter Hezbollah. A combination of limited ground troop movement and control of the skies through UAVs and Israeli fighter jets would reap enough rewards without committing too many resources (at least, according to the IDF) while also weakening Hezbollah. Kinda like the ""Mowing the Lawn"" strategy used against Hamas in Gaza. (though any Israeli how the strategy turned out last year).

In short, Israel wants the benefits without the costs. A limited occupational buffer zone of about 5-10 km in South Lebanon with limited small-scale IDF raids into Lebanese villages coupled with complete dominance of the sky with IAF UAVs, fighter jets, and airstrikes. This would preserve IDF casualties and lower the monetary cost of the occupation but at the same time, lessen the risk and damage of Hezbollah attacks. This is what I could piece about the Israeli plan so far.

The IDF strategy so far seems to rely more on ground troops and light vehicles, going in slowly and methodically. While in 2006, they blitzed their way to Bint Jbeil, here (which led to more casualties), the IDF in 2024 has pursued a cautious and wary approach. It's no wonder why Merkava tanks are less seen in Lebanon due to the threat of Hezbollah ATGMs.

So far, the IDF has sent 4 divisions into South Lebanon, totaling around 40,000 men, arms, and vehicles. For comparison, the 2006 war with Hezbollah totaled 40,000 at maximum. Here are the current divisions confirmed to be operating in South Lebanon.

Closed Zone A (around Metulla and Kiryat Shmona) = Operating under the 98th ""Ha-Esh"" Paratroopers Division together with the 89th Commando Brigade (comprised of the Egoz and Maglan Special Forces Unit) advancing towards the Lebanese villages of Oddaiseh and Kafr Kila. (Basically, this is the cream of the crop of the IDF forces.)

Closed Zone B (around Malikiya and Yiftah) = Operating under the 91st ""Galilee"" Division advancing towards to the Lebanese villages of Blida and Meiss El Jabal

Closed Zone C (around Yiroun and Avivim) = Operating under the 36th ""Ga'ash"" Division advancing towards the Lebanese villages of Yaroun and Maroun Al-Ras

Closed Zone D (around Hanita, Adamit, and Ras al-Naqoura) = Operating under the 146th ""HaMapetz"" Division advancing towards the Lebanese villages of Labbouneh and Naqoura.

Out of the current IDF divisions under the Northern Command, 3 out 4 are already operating in South Lebanon. The only IDF division still held back (probably as a backup reserve) is the 210st ""HaBashan"" Division

Looks like the IDF is betting on a 4-axis pincer movement. The central sectors (zones B and C) are likely heading to Bint Jbeil, Hezbollah's capital of the Southern Sector and where its strongest supporters and troops lie. The sector wings (zones A and D) are likely tasked with cleaning up the flanks and then enveloping the center, flanking Hezbollah, and grouping up with the central divisions.

**Analysis of the Current Ground Invasion**

**Here, I mapped every IDF location in South Lebanon by each day using geolocation sources with sources**  
[**https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1iBkMT47Y85K-9n5C87PI021vgVCVtEA**](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1iBkMT47Y85K-9n5C87PI021vgVCVtEA) **(See the purple pins or scroll down on the side until you reach the section labeled as ""Locations of IDF positions in Lebanon"")**

Before that, it's important to know the released IDF footage and media from and from which division, a tactic that Israel considers important to project an image of ""victory"".

The IDF announces 1 death in South Lebanon

For all the IDF's released footage and talk, it has more use as psychological warfare than actually showing results on the battlefield. The released footage on Oct 1st all were on the outskirts or even outside the various Lebanese border villages (see the mapped geolocations of the footage). Most of them were barely across the border. These were probably tunnels and infrastructure the IDF had already known for years now, but chose to only destroy them now. The IDF using them is more of a demoralizing tactic than actually proving they were able to enter Lebanon unharmed. Even Hezbollah didn't publish any statement about IDF troops entering Lebanon or engaging with them. In short, this is more show than substance.

Second, the flag operation in Maroun Al-Ras. What the IDF video hides is that this was on the outside of the town, on a garden and park overlooking Israel itself. They did not enter the main town at all. (See my map for the geolocation of the IDF video). It is disingenuous to paint the picture as if Maroun Al-Ras had fallen when they hadn't even entered the main village yet.

[https://x.com/TheCradleMedia/status/1843688506629206283](https://x.com/TheCradleMedia/status/1843688506629206283)

[https://x.com/TuiteroMartin/status/1843663692925436108](https://x.com/TuiteroMartin/status/1843663692925436108)

Now, with both of these out of the way, how much progress has the IDF achieved so far?

In Yaroun, the IDF has roughly advanced to a little more than half of the village. Geolocation sources online do not point to the IDF controlling every square inch of the town yet. Only the southern portion and the outskirts of the town are under IDF control. The IDF themselves haven't yet announced controlling the village in it's entirety. If even the IDF hasn't yet admit to controlling the village plus online sources tracking the IDF's location, then it's safe to say Yaroun still hasn't fallen. Yes, it is hotly contested but not yet in IDF control.

**Why am I explaining this?**

First, because in 2006, the IDF reached Bint Jbeil in 4 days. For context, Yaroun is situated closer to the Israeli border and in front of Maroun Al-Ras and Bint Jbeil. To get to Bint Jbeil (the main Hezbollah center of control), Israel must pass through Maroun Al-Ras. In 2024, the IDF took a full week just to reach the outskirts of that town.

Second, because it's been 10 days since the start of the ground invasion. For reference, [the battle of Maroun Al-Ras in 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Maroun_al-Ras_(2006)) (which was costly for the IDF, and the result was still contested) lasted 10 days. At the end of those 10 days, the IDF claimed ""victory"" over the local Hezbollah garrison, claiming to have complete control over the village. However, outside sources paint a different picture of Hezbollah guerillas still active in different parts of the city.

If the IDF still hasn't announced a victory yet in Yaroun in 2024 even after 10 days, then the situation on the ground is not pretty for them.

Third, the 2006 battle of Maroun Al-Ras cost 8 IDF dead, many from the Maglan Special Forces Unit. This was after the battle had ended after 10 days. The IDF is still fighting in Yaroun and has already cost the lives of several IDF troops including those from the Egoz Unit, the special forces created to fight Hezbollah itself.

(Note, out of all the battles that took place in 2006, Maroun Al-Ras was the most ""successful"" for the IDF. Other border village battles were far less successful"")

As for Maroun Al-Ras in 2024, I've already stated how the IDF only managed to reach the outskirts and still hasn't penetrated deeper into the village.

**This concludes the 36th Division's progress so far in Zone C. TLDR: They've managed to advance only half into Yaroun and barely reach the outskirts of Maroun Al-Ras. None of the villages has been fully controlled by the IDF so far.**

Now the 98th Division and Zone A. First, it looks like after the ""difficult situation"" on Oct 2 with 8 dead from the Egoz Unit and several more wounded, the IDF decided to pause operations for a while (to regroup and replenish) and resume only on Oct 5th, 3 days later. So far, the IDF still hasn't gained full control over Oddaiseh. Geolocation sources haven't found any evidence, photo, or footage from released IDF footage that shows the IDF advancing deeper. It's in the same boat as Yaroun. Though they have made some progress, they still have failed to advance deeper and gain control over the entire village after 10 days. The IDF also hasn't announced any sort of ""victory"" or ""complete control"" over Oddaiseh.

For Kafr Kila, it's even worse. There are photos of a left-behind IDF M113 infantry fighting vehicle geoconfirmed to be in Kafr Kila (though sources say it was booby-trapped before being left-behind).

[https://x.com/Asia\_Intel/status/1841807466977214569](https://x.com/Asia_Intel/status/1841807466977214569)

However, only recently on Oct 8, has the IDF released footage advancing once again into the village. So far, they've only managed a few meters into the outskirts of the village. As of now, no new footage or evidence has been released.

**This concludes the 98th Division's progress so far in Zone A. TLDR: They suffered losses on Oct 2nd and only recently came back on Oct 5th. Even then, they've only managed to advance only a portion of Oddaiseh and barely a few meters into Kafr Kila. None of the villages have been fully controlled by the IDF so far.**

Next, the 91st and 146th. Oh boy, these are even worse!

We'll start with the 91st. After the IDF announces the entry of the 91st into South Lebanon on Oct 7th, they only manage to release footage on Oct 10th, 3 days later. That at least shows they faced stiff resistance from the local Hezbollah garrison to even set foot into the village. Hezbollah announced before they ambushed an IDF force advancing towards Blida. This means it took 3 full days just to enter the village. Even then, the currently released footage only shows IDF troops advancing on the outskirts of the town so far as per geolocation sources. They haven't yet been able to fully clear the village of Hezbollah guerillas. Unfortunately, this is only what I could get so far as the operation in Blida is very much recent. So far, the situation in Blida mirrors that in Yaroun and Oddaiseh.

**This concludes the 91st Division's progress so far in Zone B. TLDR: It took them 3 days just to enter the village and even then, they've only managed to reach the outskirts. Their situation mirrors that in Yaroun and Oddaiseh.**

Last, the 146th. So far this is the worst situation out of the 4 divisions. The IDF has only announced the start of operations on Oct 8th and so far, no additional footage has been released after two days. This means the division still hasn't even entered any Lebanese village in their sector. Even worse, Hezbollah announced launching mortars and rockets at an advancing IDF column in Labbouneh around 5 vehicles and 60 soldiers. Thankfully, Al-Mayadeen broadcasted live the advance of the IDF in Labbouneh on October 10th, just today. Footage shows smoke rising from the Hezbollah attack.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/lebanon/comments/1g0evmk/idf\_convoy\_consisting\_of\_about\_60\_soldeirs\_and\_5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lebanon/comments/1g0evmk/idf_convoy_consisting_of_about_60_soldeirs_and_5/)

[https://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/1844339139384148246](https://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/1844339139384148246)

Hezbollah once again targeted Israeli forces with guided missiles as they attempted to evacuate casualties from the Ras al-Naqoura area in southern Lebanon. According to Al-Mayadeen's correspondent, Israeli forces have been unable to retrieve the casualties, having tried three times but failing due to heavy bombardment by Hezbollah.

[https://x.com/Currentreport1/status/1844347725376258395](https://x.com/Currentreport1/status/1844347725376258395)

**This concludes the 146st Division's progress so far in Zone D. TLDR: They still haven't managed to enter Labbouneh village.**

After 10 days of ground operations, the IDF has managed to advance 300 meters inside Odaisseh, 200 meters inside Blida and 200 meters inside Yaroun

In Odaisseh, the IDF has set up positions in 3 houses right on the border. In Maroun El Ras, they captured a hill south of the town, which contains a park, known as ÿ≠ÿØŸäŸÇÿ© ÿ•Ÿäÿ±ÿßŸÜ (Iranian garden). They have NOT entered the main part of the town.

The IDF also attempted to advance in Labbouneh and Kfar Kila, but was thwarted especially from Hezbollah's anti-tank and explosive units. The 146th still hasn't entered in Labbouneh after 2 days, while the IDF withdrew from Kafr Kila and only have returned to the village 5 days later.

**Israeli Use of UNIFIL Human Shields**

On October 8th, reports came in of IDF tanks and troops using a UNIFIL base as human shields, setting up a Foward Operating Base (FOB) right outside UNIFIL outpost 6-52 in Southern Lebanon, currently manned by Irish Peacekeepers. Reports also state Israeli tanks were parked outside the UN base. The UN has protested Israel's actions, saying it endangers UNIFIL troops. News channels have also reported this.

[https://www.thenational.scot/news/24636493.israel-endangering-irish-troops-lebanon-border/](https://www.thenational.scot/news/24636493.israel-endangering-irish-troops-lebanon-border/)

[https://www.plenglish.com/news/2024/10/07/israel-denounced-for-using-unifil-forces-as-human-shields/](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2024/10/07/israel-denounced-for-using-unifil-forces-as-human-shields/)

Interestingly, Hezbollah released a statement also reporting the same thing. If you don't believe Hezbollah, then at least you'll believe the photos I'll present later,

*""Yesterday, Sunday,* ***the Islamic Resistance fighters reported that they had observed unusual movement of Israeli enemy forces behind a UNIFIL military site in the outskirts of the border town of Maroun al-Ras in southern Lebanon.***

*The Islamic Resistance Operations Room asked the fighters to be patient and not to deal with the movement in order to preserve the lives of the soldiers of the international forces.*

*The Israeli enemy is trying to use the UNIFIL international forces as human shields to cover up its failure to advance towards the village, especially after its failed and repeated attempts on more than one axis to advance towards Maroun al-Ras.""*

Here are photos that prove these allegations,

[https://ibb.co/7pSwrKp](https://ibb.co/7pSwrKp) (satellite image of an IDF forward operating base and parked Merkava tanks)

**Casualties**

The IDF has only confirmed 13 deaths so far in the ground invasion of Lebanon (most of whom come from the elite Egoz and Paratrooper units) including 3 captain military officers though I suspect tens more have been wounded in the ground operation (which is what we would expect in war) according to footage of medevac helicopter evacuations to hospitals in Northern Israel. Hezbollah on the other hand has announced 35 IDF dead and 200 wounded. The IDF claims 500 Hezbollah guerillas have been killed since the start of the ground operation. The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle so far. I won't go into an in-depth analysis of the number of deaths since info is quite scarce at this moment so I'll leave it at that.

**Conclusion:**

The current 2024 ground war in Lebanon still hasn't resulted in much for the IDF. Although they've managed to enter a few border villages, it has already cost them precious time, money and lives. Not a single Lebanese border village so far has been overrun and fully taken by the IDF. This is far worse than what happen in 2006, where the IDF managed to take over Maroun Al-Ras (though contested) in 10 days. Now, even after 10 days in 2024 Lebanon, the IDF still hasn't managed to completely clear even a single Lebanese border village. They still haven't entered Maroun Al-Ras even deeper, reached Bint Jbeil or enter Labbouneh. The scars of 2006 still held sway over the minds of IDF commanders, which is why they have taken a different approach this time, going in slowly with mostly ground troops rather than tanks. Only time will tell how successful this new strategy will turn out to be."
1g0p1fo,I support Palestine in a way that causes me to support Israel.,2024-10-10 18:03:55,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g0p1fo/i_support_palestine_in_a_way_that_causes_me_to/,"When it comes to war in general, I am not on the side of any military. I am on the side of the innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. To everyone in this conflict and any conflict who has killed the innocent, you are a monster and may it be your last aching regret before you die, whenever that comes. With all the uninvolved lives lost in this conflict, I agree with the International Court of Justice in issuing arrest warrants for both the leaders of Israel and Hamas.

But everyone expects me to choose a government I support, so here is my opinion on that after carefully pondering it this past year.

As a gun owner who thinks a lot about self-defense rights, it's important to me to determine who was the initial aggressor in a conflict. Their victim's violence is justified; theirs is not.

It is clear that the initial aggressor in the Israel-Palestine conflict is Israel. It was they who first invaded, occupied, colonised, stole, etcetera Palestinian lands in forming their state. I do not recognize any sort of historical Israeli claim to the region any more than a British person would recognize a Roman claim to their land on the basis of the 500 years of Roman occupation of Britain. I once saw an image listing all the wars that Palestine and the Arab states had fought against Israel, with every entry reading ""[Name of war, date] Who started it? [Some combination of Arab states] Who was attacked? üáÆüá±"" The list conveniently left out one entry at the start.

> British/Jewish colonization of Palestine (~1910s-1948)

> Who started it? üáÆüá±üá¨üáß

> Who was attacked? üáµüá∏

So, I find it entirely understandable and permissible that Palestinians continue to battle for freedom. After all, that is what a founder of Zionism, Ze'ev Zhobatinsky, predicted would happen.

> Every native population in the world resists colonists as long as it has the slightest hope of being able to rid itself of the danger of being colonised.

> That is what the Arabs in Palestine are doing, and what they will persist in doing as long as there is a solitary spark of hope that they will be able to resist the transformation of Palestine into the Land of Israel.

---

That being said...

While I believe Palestinians have every right to continue fighting, I do not believe it is in their best interest to do so. They are the ones who suffer most from their struggles, for it is mainly Palestinian civilians who die in the conflicts. (I say this not to blame Palestine for Israel's unconscionable bombing of civilians, but simply to point out the reality of the situation.) I'm no expert military analyst, but as I understand it Israel has superior weaponry, technology, infrastructure, manpower, etcetera and I see no way for Palestine to obtain freedom for themselves by military means. I do not believe Israel has a ""right to exist"", per se, but I also believe that it cannot be dislodged and should therefore be left alone, and Palestinians should seek freedom by diplomatic means.

It is my understanding that Israelis have become skeptical that Palestinians will ever accept peace. As I discussed above, that is correct, and they probably won't. So I understand Israel's use of blockades and checkpoints to control the conflict. I don't exactly like it, because it is another oppressive measure by an aggressor, but at the same time if Israel truly desires peace then I understand the motivation behind it as an effort to force Palestinians into a peaceful solution.

Here I will acknowledge Israel's superior record of human rights. At least, over its own citizens. Its record at protecting the human rights of Palestinians is as abysmal as Palestine's own record of that. If they could give Palestinians the same rights as Israelis, that would be a good thing. That's what I'd like to know‚Äîdoes Israel want to do that?

In other words, I feel the same way about Israel and Palestine as I do about my own country's colonization of its Aboriginal peoples. Yes, it was a terrible thing my ancestors did. In a perfect world where we were all kind to each other, Canada would not exist. But so much infrastructure, 40 million people's lives, are tied up in the concept of a unified Canada. Does anyone propose that white Canadians all leave the unceded native lands? If the Inuit repeatedly rose up in violent rebellion against Canada, then I would support the Canadian government trying to force them into diplomacy.

---

In terms of what I'm going to do about it, and what I think my country should do, the answer is: nothing.

I agree with Maxime Bernier, leader of the People's Party of Canada: ""I don't want a single penny of Canadian taxpayers' money to go to support EITHER SIDE of another foreign war that has nothing to do with us."""
1g0kmwp,Jewish home in kaliningrad hypothetical complement to Israel,2024-10-10 14:52:45,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g0kmwp/jewish_home_in_kaliningrad_hypothetical/,"Highly hypothetically of course but kaliningrad is not historically russian and could in the event of a collapse of Putins rule potentially be a candidate for its own state. Kaliningrad is quite poor only have about 1 million inhabitants in an area 3/4 of Israel and with a population thats a bit diverse at least with at least 80% identifying as russians with a considerable amount of mixed people from different slavic countries.

Say in 10 years time kaliningrad is established as a free state it could gain huge amount of international attention and funding by establishing itself as a jewish home with free immigration for any jew of at least ashkenazi heritage with perhaps yiddish as alternative language. Probably a demilitarized state by design and with almost no muslims it would give jews in europe and america an alternative to moving to Israel for avoiding persecution and perhaps some find it fulfilling to repopulate the area the nazis ethnically cleansed them from(well close enough, way more lived in the neighbouring states). With only 80-100k immigrants a year they could be 50% within a decade. Say they also allow germans with heritage from east prussia to come back and you could get a sliver of west europeans too.

The state itself have no real benefits over its neighbours so external support and jewish industry establishment would be important if it is to prosper.

What do you say would:

1. There be support and establishment from US and Israel?
2. Jewish capital and companies move there from israel?
3. Be secular jews moving there from israel? No military service, war weariness and increased desillusion from the Israeli left being potential reasons
4. Be religious and ultra orthodox moving there?
5. This be even remotely possible in general? Would it be a threat to israeli claims long term?

This new state would probably not have the same generous support for ultraortodox but in return no draft laws. In referenser today kaliningrad have a gdp of only 10kusd/capita compared to 50 in israel. Purchasing power index is 75 for Israel ca 50 for baltic states and 35 for russia today. But hey cheap housing, same timezone as Tel Aviv and no one shooting rockets at you

Now please tear into this scenario and point out weaknesses"

Who is this man and what does he think? Just because he went on trip and saw some particular villages, now he can describe a whole system that is taking place? I think he should change his name to ""Sugar Coates"" instead of Ta-Nehisi Coates because that is how he is characterizing the issue.



Often times, he compares the situation in Hebron to the Jim Crow era when the blacks and his parents were growing up in the south of USA. This is such as outrageous inflammatory anti-semitic way to see the issue. Hebron belongs to the Jews and it is an ancient site for Judaism. In fact, the majority of the city's population today is Palestinians and they prevent the Jews there from living peacefully. The Jews are undergoing apartheid in Hebron. Noble and brave people in Hebron like Baruch Marzel and Itamar Ben-Gvir and defending the Jews from anti-semitism there. Did Mr TaCo see all that?



Check out this interview wherein Mr Coat was asked whether he supports Israel's right to exist and he couldn't answer it at all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgWt-QcPYMo&t=324s. He got floored by the interviewer.



Overall, I am disappointed that many mainstream media outlets are inviting Mr Goat on their show and giving a voice to promote his book. Nevertheless, I think ADL and probably AIPAC should look into this goat and see what he is up to!"

What do you guys think about that? There's two issues raised, one of them being the targeting of UNIFIL troops with israeli tanks, and the other is destroying the UN security cameras.  

We all know Israel requested UNIFIL to withdraw from their positions but the UN denied their request, and now we see the IDF targeting UNIFIL directly.

Israel also has targeted members of the civil defense in a christian/shia village, where the church hall was struck (https://www.nna-leb.gov.lb/en/justice-law/728694/search-continues-for-missing-under-rubble-of-church). There has been many deaths among paramedics as well.  

Israel also directly struck the Lebanese Army who are staying neutral in this fight (https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/in-first-since-beginning-of-war-lebanese-army-returns-fire-at-israeli-forces/).   

As a Lebanese, I want this war to end, and I want to have an independent country free from a militia owning weapons and acting without the state's authority. However, Israel is making it harder and harder for any Lebanese to support this issue because of them deliberately targeting the lebanese army, UNIFIL, paramedics, etc.

1g0gwqo,Nakba Historiography,2024-10-10 11:47:26,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1g0gwqo/nakba_historiography/,"I recently came across the movie ""Farha,"" which depicts a Palestinian perspective on the events of 1948. I have seen the movie attacked for being ""anti-semitic"" and ""false history,"" with Netflix wavering to even show it. But as somebody who studies history at college and has read on the events of 1948, I am really puzzled on where the academic basis of this perspective comes from. In my readings, I have come across various primary sources - interviews with Haganah soldiers, interviews with Palestinian victims, and even diary accounts from British advisors - all confirming that killings and other attacks on Palestinian civilians were widespread in 1948. That Haganah troops essentially utilized violence in hundreds of towns to empty the villages of Palestinian non-combatants. One of the most disturbing cases I can think of off the top of my head is Ein al-Zeitun, where 39 teenage boys were selected at random and executed with their hands tied behind their backs by Zionist forces. I also read of biological warfare being used on non-combatants, akin to that seen in North America against Indigenous Americans. Oftentimes the 1948 War is portrayed as a fight between a much weaker Israeli forces and a much larger Arab coalition. But in almost every case I could find, Zionist forces overwhelmingly outnumbered what little resistance each Palestinian town had. I was wondering if anyone with an opposing opinion has an academically vetted source which would contradict on a macro-scale my interpretation of the 1948 War. As of right now, I fail to see how any of these well documented Nakba atrocities are ""false history."" Quite frankly, this kind of evidence in any other context would be more than enough to substantiate a general consensus that war crimes were committed. It seems that those who deny this interpretation are not doing so in good-faith and/or are misinformed, and I just want to understand the opposing interpretation a bit better. Especially as (I believe) anti-semitism is on the rise, especially on the far right, it seems dangerous to just go around labelling things as anti-semitic that simply oppose your perspective."

It is also true Netanyahu and his government who have enabled this behavior came to power after five years of bombing and several failed peace offers.  
  
  
It is true Israel has been enveloped in a horrific rage since October 7 and could have pursued its Gaza military campaign with much greater attention to minimizing civilian casualties.  


It is also true Yahya Sinwar has sought to maximize Gazan deaths (‚Äúeven 100,000 deaths is not too great a sacrifice‚Äù) as part of a specific strategy to isolate Israel.



It is true Netanyahu has pursued a war and hostage release strategy influenced at every turn by his desire to retain political power and avoid facing corruption charges.  
  
It is also true Netanyahu has been entirely correct that Iran seeks to dominate the Middle East and their possession of an atomic weapon rest poses an existential risk for everyone in the ME and beyond.



It is true in 1948 Israel forcibly expelled some Palestinians from their land to create a more secure Israel in what rightfully can be called ‚Äúethnic cleansing.‚Äù  
  
It is also true invading Arab governments would have expelled or slaughtered 100% of Jews in Palestine if their war had been successful, and had no reservations about expelling 800,000 Jews from their own countries.  


It is true a two state solution is likely the only means of achieving peace in the Middle East in the long term and Israel need to recognize this.  
  
It is also true the Americans left is unfathomably naive to believe Israel ‚Äî in the shadow of October 7 ‚Äî would create an independent, militarized West Bank state in the shadow of Tel Aviv anytime soon.  
  
  
It is true Israel has followed an unworkable and malign strategy of managing low conflicts and ‚Äòde facto‚Äô West Bank annexation while making Palestinians life miserable for the last 25 years.  
  
It is also true Israel has looked at past negotiations with Palestinians and determined no leader has ever emerged with the authority and stature to pursue and finalize any land for peace deal.  
  
  
It is true American college students are protesting with the best of intentions and seek only to reduce harm committed against innocent civilians.  
  
It is also true American college students have shown enormous na√Øvet√© in their understanding of Hamas and the Middle East, expressed no empathy for any viewpoint but their own, and have rapidly transformed a concern around civilian casualties into a baffling debate about a single country‚Äôs right to exist.  
  
  
It is true Gaza as a state has been under enormous economic and political stress over the past 18 years and has been bullied by both Israel and Egypt to the horrific detriment of the civilian population.  
  
It is also true Gaza chose its destiny by electing Hamas (which it could never dislodge) and then suffering inevitable Israel blockades to stop Hamas from pursuing its stated intention of destroying Israel.  


It is true Israeli Arabs are second class citizens in their own country.

It is also true Israeli Arabs possess far more civil rights than almost any majority Arab country.  


It is true American tax dollars are being used ‚Äî deliberately or not ‚Äî to kill innocent civilians in both Gaza and Lebanon.

It is also true American tax dollars are being used to weaken a global alliance of Iran - China - Russia - North Korea - Iranian vassal states in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and Gaza who deny their billions of citizens even the most basic human right to elect their own leaders.  


  
It‚Äôs true Ta-Nehisi Coates writes with verve, emotion, and passion and deserves recognition as a great writer.

1fzw1z3,What's happening to the jails in Gaza?,2024-10-09 16:48:57,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fzw1z3/whats_happening_to_the_jails_in_gaza/,"I've been following the recent events in Gaza and Israel, and I'm curious about the Palestinian jails in Gaza. Those who hold local prisoners, ranging from DUI to murder. In Gaza, when Hamas is responsible for guarding the jails and Israel targets Hamas members, who is currently guarding the jails? Did Israel bomb the jails? Since Palestinian prisoners are locked up and cannot move to safe zones, do they face danger as a result of this conflict? Is there anything being done to ensure the safety of Palestinian prisoners? I haven't found any articles about this. Have all the prisoners been released, or is anyone caring for them in these jails? If so, were they taken to a safe area? Do they receive food or medical care? Are they still under guard, or are they free?

In the event that Hamas is targeted and potentially incapacitated by Israeli actions, it raises significant concerns about the continuity of security and order within these jails. If Hamas cannot provide necessities for the prisoners, there could be a humanitarian crisis. Additionally, prisoners may attempt to escape or form gangs, leading to an increase in criminal activity. 

My main questions are: If Hamas is being targeted by Israel, who is guarding Palestinian jails? Have there been any reports of prisoners being released or escaping? Have prisoners been moved to safe zones? Have any international observers toured the prisons? Has the International Committee of the Red Cross inspected Palestinian prisons? Has any inspection been conducted to ensure the safety of prisoners? Are prisoners protected from Israeli airstrikes?"
1fztkos,Palenstine Supporters are their own worse enemy,2024-10-09 15:04:55,113,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fztkos/palenstine_supporters_are_their_own_worse_enemy/,"Palestine supporters have truly embarrassed not only themselves but their entire cause. To clarify I am not supporting Israel, nor am I supporting Palestine, both have done terrible things, made foolish mistakes, and both are guilty of what's happening in their situation. however, Palestine supporters have been making it worse for them the most. Firstly, it seems to be that it's not about the cause but the benefits it will give them. Meaning that Palenstine is more of a personal gain whether it's money, attention, praise, etc. It feels like they are not even criticizing Israel, but more spreading Disinformation and making Palestine their Identity, yeah weirdly enough, putting a watermelon on your profile name or doing a quirky TikTok dance did not save Palestine?

And they will believe anything they hear from people who are using Palestine for fame. For instance, yourfavoriteguy, who is a ""pro-Palestine creator"" has a dark past where he faked his death for attention, used to post more far-right content, and took credit for catching a huge tiktoker who was a pedo even tho all he did mostly was post other peoples work(so maybe he brought attention to it but from the way he's bragging about it, he acts like he did all the work when he never did) But he has been caught many times for spreading Disinformation where he creates 15.99 tips for people to pay him, or his subscription even tho he's""not doing it for the money"" he's been caught deleting many of his posts when proven wrong and also Palestine supporters have exposed him for ignoring to donate to Palestine lives. he in his video has admitted he's using them for views. now you're probably thinking, well obviously you would think Palestine supporters would be against that, NOPE!!! not only do they support him even more they defend him like wtf?

Secondly, there's this whole other side where it seems like the problem isnt what Israel is doing in Gaza, but the fact that Israel exists in general upsets them. They will post things that aren't even related to Gaza like""JESUS WAS ACTUALLY PALENSTANIAN"" like wtf what does this have to do with your criticism of Israel doing in Gaza or in Lebanon? the amount of pure cruelty of harassment, bullying, and antisemitism on these social media just because they so happen to be Jewish, i can give thousands of examples but that of course would take forever.

And the worst part about them is that they are HUGE hypocrites, like unless its Israel or any Western white relations to what happening in the world, its fine, yeah, for example, Hasan Piker said what China was doing to the People in Uyghur(if you dont know you should look into it very sad stuff) is totally fine, or Libya, Somalia, Congo, all of it is ok except when Israel is doing something bad lol. now obviously if these people were nothing but keyboard warriors then whatever, they show little harm, however of course, they need to show the world how much of a tumor they are, by ruining every freaking event in the world, destroying people's property or cars, houses, you name it.

Block students from entering their classes, destroying libraries, blocking traffic, going to airports to harass people from Israel, ect. and of course, they make the most pathetic excuse for their actions and what they say, its either""iT sPrEaDs aWarENeSS"" like i think people are aware of what's going on lol, or 2,""what it's not as bad as genocide, whats so wrong about being against genocide"" You can be against genocide that's fine, however its, when you harass others and make yourselves to be the most obnoxious people on planet earth. What's happening in Gaza and in Israel is ridiculously sad and frustrating to watch, however, what the majority of the Palestine supporters have been doing, makes the IDF and Netanyahu look really good. This post was more of a vent so if you agree than great if not whatever."
1fzp31p,I am struggling to understand what Israel is trying to do and why many Western countries have taken sides with Israel. ,2024-10-09 11:24:19,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fzp31p/i_am_struggling_to_understand_what_israel_is/,"What Israel has been doing is either killing and torturing Palestinian people or bringing their livelihood into the poorest condition, and it started long before Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th.  Netanyahu claimed that Jews have always been there on the land and Arabs took them out of their land. As far as I know,  the land was conquered by a variety of different empires throughout history just like most of the other countries that are formed today. The Roman Empire defeated Jews in about 60 BC, and later Arabs eventually took over the land. Let us not forget also that Palestinian people were already living their lives in the state of Palestine during the world wars until the United States government and Britain decided to open the state for Jewish refugees after the Second World War.  If we approach this conflict by arguing about who are people with origins or who was the earliest inhabitant of the area,  not only are we not gonna be able to solve the problem, but also we end up having pointless discussions over and over again. However, I think that has exactly been how Jewish people viewed the Palestinians for decades so they wanted to be in control of them no matter how brutal it got because they hate sharing their land. They have shown the entire world that they want Palestinians out and Hamas ignited Israel's ultimate longing to kill more Palestinians, resulting in Israel passive-aggressively causing more harm and slaughterings, now in the name of 'national defense'.  

When you look at the United States of America and its history, it was the land of Native Americans, conquered by Britains and Europeans and now comprised of all sorts of Americans such as African Americans, Asian Americans, European Americans, and so on.  This is 21st century. Israel's longing for Jewish State is nothing short of an unrealistic ideology unless they keep going this way which can lead to genocide just like Nazi Germany did to Jews with their pseudoscientific racial ideology.

1fznz5w,Could Israel use a strategic nuclear weapon on Iran to prevent its nuclear program?,2024-10-09 10:11:42,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fznz5w/could_israel_use_a_strategic_nuclear_weapon_on/,"I have been having this thought recently but I'm posting this question here because I'm ignorant of the more practical matters on the ground. 

Thinking about Israel, Iran, and the lessons from history; I think there are only two things that are absolutely true about the both of the parties;

1. Iran has a fanatical urge to bring an end to Israel's existence as a state.

2. Israel (especially after Oct. 7th) has a fanatical urge to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear capable country.

And as things currently stand; now is the best time for Iran to become a nuclear capable country as their Axis of Resistance is getting severely weakened. 

Israel, who is a nuclear capable country, would have to strike very hard on Iran in the places where it's due to prevent it from becoming a nuclear capable country, considering that to destroy Iran's ability to develop and deploy a nuclear weapon would require Israel to deliver a finishing blow to Iran's key sites that could only be done decisively with a strategic nuclear weapon, I presume. 

Yes, the US with its current administration will not approve this, and Israel will become immediately an international pariah (as if it hasn't already; contributing more to its sense to forgo it's international standing as it's a lost cause already). 

Plus, the use of nuclear weapons for any purpose is the highest of taboos in international politics that even a state like Iran might not expect Israel to take such a radical action in order to prevent it from acquiring even a single nuclear warhead; which is exactly why Israel may choose to undertake this radical course of action. 

And if those key Iranian sites are located somewhere far from civilian areas, and the hypothetical nuclear weapons that could be used to strike are something less than the Tsar Bomba, would it really be that amoral if no civilian casualties (or at least a miniscule amount) would be involved? 

I'm posting this thought primarily to find some faults in my logic... So thank you for the engagement.

1fzn8w4,Why are things the way they are (mostly rambling),2024-10-09 09:18:03,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fzn8w4/why_are_things_the_way_they_are_mostly_rambling/,"Quick summary: yours truly is a 30 something year old secular Muslim Jordanian dual citizen. Born and raised between Jordan and the US. Currently work as a physician and a part time teacher.

Prior to the incidents of Oct 7^(th), the Palestinian issue has been more of a curiosity to me personally. It never quite coalesced enough as to invoke the requisite for deep thought as it did following the incidents. It just seemed like a jumble of historical mess, which in some ways it still is, and reverting to the colloquial oppressor-oppressed narrative was the easiest thing to do.

My activity on Reddit was limited to browsing alone on few subreddits. However, seeing the abhorrent level of moral double standard displayed on r/Jordan was a little too bitter of a pill to swallow for me. Subsequently, after whipping up an account and speaking my mind using mostly sarcasm and wit to criticize the values that considered HAMAS as the ‚Äúresistance‚Äù, I was deemed an ‚ÄúElectronic Fly‚Äù in Arabic, a term to this day I am still ignorant about the implications or the origin of, and banned from that subreddit.

If anyone says that antisemitism is not a rampant affliction among the Arab/Muslim societies, at least in the limited sample I hail from, at least in the limited sample I interact with on daily basis both on and offline, then that person is lying with ill intent. In my humble estimation, there is no reality in which the things done by HAMAS on that terrible day get heralded as right, good, and just without an overlying conviction that doing Jews wrong makes it right. This is no bueno.

In a recent family gathering here in Amman, my father and uncles got together over a meal and some tea afterwards. Discussions varied between different topics of the day, and of course the train of conversation stopped at the inevitable Palestinian/Israeli station for a bit. There was an analogy proposed by my father who also happens to be a retired physician that I think is quite good. He described Palestinians living outside of Israel but within the west bank or neighboring regions as the brother in the family that develops an addiction, becomes completely dysfunctional, and then us, being the siblings, do nothing but enable his addiction. It was a tad bit uncomfortable to be cast in a guilty light, but my father has accumulated more wisdom than anyone I had the pleasure of meeting. Now, this in no way aimed to discredit or disrespect the minority of Palestinians who see wrong and call wrong.

Comparing my father‚Äôs analogy to my own experiences, I can safely confess that this prejudicial double standard exists in one side, my people‚Äôs side. Now, I am sure if I went and met people in Israel who are a tad more ideologically inclined, I would find a resembling faulty standard, but to the Jews/Israeli, those are a minority! To us, the majority! And that‚Äôs not ideal at all.

All the prior disclosure is not aimed at conviction of my fellow kinsmen, even though it may sound like it. But oh God do we need to start examining ourselves and our values because our fathers and grandfathers did a lousy job at it! This is a call to listen to that voice all us humans share which lets us navigate life with honesty and fairness. We need to have the courage and humility to stop this vicious cycle of irrationality in which innocent civilians are perishing.

Stop enabling the empty emotional slogans. Encourage the Palestinians to get their values and house in order so they can run a state with neighbors instead. That is bar none the foremost favor you can do Palestinians. And to the Israelis in particular, you have got to do a better job at winning hearts and minds of Palestinians to ease the distress they are feeling. I am a simple doctor, but you have proven plenty crafty, there has got to be a better way of doing things."

I mean, what do these Iraqis think? That they can keep harassing and killing Jews without any repercussions? And why do they want to get involved and care about Palestine which is so far away?

Some of my relatives were making stupid statements saying ""The Golan is an occupied territory, does not belong to Israel and the IDF soldiers shouldn't be there"". The Golan was lawfully annexed in 1981 and even Trump a few years ago officially gave the Golan to the Jews. The Golan is also needed for Israel's security, so the Jews will never give it back! My thoughts and prayers are for the poor soldiers who got killed and wounded there.

Also, the Americans went into Iraq in 2003 and seem unable to control it anymore. I always wonder how are they launching all these drones and cruise missiles when USA is there and is supposed to thoroughly monitor them. Demented old Biden seems to be sleeping at the steering wheel and has done such a good job in the past few years of giving Iraq away to Iran, absolutely hopeless!

I think Israel shouldn't tolerate these unprovoked attacks, it seems the Iraqis are constantly launching more and more with the support of Iran. As the Jews have done in Gaza and Beirut to combat terrorism, IMO, they should also flatten Baghdad and Erbil. That will teach these Iraqis a lesson while they claim to support Palestine. "

In a blog post by Roots Metals, she claims a dramatic population change between 1800 (\~350,000 people) to 1950 (\~2,000,000 people). She states: ‚Äúthe sudden population boom between 1850 and 1900 did not come from natural population growth but from Arab immigration.‚Äù She highlights different reasons for immigration during this time from places like Egypt, North Africa, and Circassia (north east side of the Black Sea‚Ä¶ today part of Russia).  
  
If this is true, I find the idea to be a really important piece of the story when people are arguing over who has the right to live on this land. For, at the very least pragmatic purposes, my stance is everyone is staying regardless, but 1) does anyone have any supportive sources for these claims? And 2) what are your thoughts on this, that a majority of Palestinian Arabs likely have comparably recent immigration histories to the region as compared to the Jewish people who started arriving in the late 19th century.

If you're looking to understand more about the Israel-Palestine conflict, I highly recommend a newly released documentary called **""From the River to the Sea""**, which was live-streamed yesterday. It‚Äôs already surpassed **1 million views** in under 24 hours, and it‚Äôs available for **free** on YouTube. The best part? It's available in **English, French, Hebrew, and Spanish**!

This documentary, produced by **Brasil Paralelo**, offers a deep dive into the historical and modern context of the conflict. It sheds light on both sides of the story, presenting different perspectives while humanizing the people directly affected. Unlike many one-sided portrayals, this film goes beyond the surface to provide a balanced look at the conflict.

The cinematography is beautiful, and the documentary is very engaging, making it an excellent resource for anyone‚Äîwhether you're familiar with the conflict or just starting to learn about it. The visuals, combined with high-quality research and interviews, make it an easy yet powerful watch.

***How to watch:***

1fzeko8,The IDF is a terrorist Organization,2024-10-09 00:08:05,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fzeko8/the_idf_is_a_terrorist_organization/,"Today I will be defending the claim that the IDF is no less a terrorist organization than Hamas.

  
Claim 1:   
We call Hamas a terror organization for two reasons.    
1: Launching Terrorist Attacks  
2: International Recognition

Launching terror attacks, as Israeli's are quick to point out, is not unique to terrorist organizations.  Russia, China, India, and Pakistan for example have launched many advanced terrorist attacks.    


Really quick tangent:  
So that we have our definitions straight: a terror attack is an attack which knowingly kills or endangers civilians for a political agenda.  
For example the October 7th attacks were primarily targeted towards civilians because the majority of casualties were civilians, even if Hamas claims their objectives were to only kill combatants.  
For the purposes of this discussion I will define a civilian as someone who does not pose as a reasonable threat to  any civilians.

back to the topic, we do not call Pakistan, China, India, etc. or their militaries terrorist organizations.  This is because no country, or organization considers these groups to be terrorist organizations.

Claim2:  
Israel has committed Terrorist attacks  
Israel has committed hundreds, if not thousands of terror attacks in the past year.  For the purpose of this argument I will discuss only a few

September 187h Attacks:  On September 17th 2024 the IDF launched a series of targeted attacks against civilians in Lebanon to spread terror and fear.  Israel claims the attacks were targeted against combatants, but the vast majority of casualties were civilians.  The losses can also not be counted off as ""collateral damage"" (a phrase often used by Pakistan and Russia and recently picked by Israel) because the bombs were planted inside Cell phones, pagers, and other mass communication devices used by both Civilians and combatants.  
  
Al-Mawasi Massacre: On July 13th 2024 the IDF launched a bombing campaign on the ""Safe-Zone"" of al-Mawasi.   The IDF noticed two un-armed Hamas members entering the zone, likely to get food or to say goodbye to family.  The IDF then targeted and killed them, and 90 other civilians who had nothing to do with Hamas.  Again this isn't  ""collateral damage"", Israel knew, when they dropped the bomb, that they were going to kill civilians, and chose to do it anyway.   



Claim 3:  
The IDF is an internationally recognized terrorist organization.

16 countries consider the IDF to be a terrorist organization. This is an objective fact, but the main criticism is probably that these countries only make this claim because they are antisemitic.  
This is a ridiculous claim, if you are one of many groups which decides to commit terrorist acts, you must accept that some countries will then consider your military (or parts of it) to be terrorist organizations.  I, as an Afghan do not consider to be racism or Islamophobic when the Taliban (which has done less terror attacks then Israel) is considered a terrorist organization.    

I also really strongly disagree with the commonly used claim in this subreddit, that ""Criticizing Israel is antisemitic , and just like saying the N-word, only Jews can do it without being antisemitic""   
Though that will be a discussion for another time.

Thank you! I am excited to see responses and adapt/fix my views accordingly!"
1fzdrd6,"What does the word ""Zionist"" mean to you?",2024-10-08 23:28:43,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fzdrd6/what_does_the_word_zionist_mean_to_you/,"I see the word thrown around a lot but it seems like pro-Palestine and pro-Israel people have different ideas of what the word actually means. I consider myself a Zionist because I believe that the State of Israel should exist in some form as a nation of, by, and for Jews, regardless of whatever Palestine does. Let them have their land as long as we get to keep ours. But it seems like pro-Palestine people define it as ""Jewish supremacist who believes Muslims should be wiped out"" and that's really concerning because it's never meant that. Does anyone have any insight on this?

I believe that there is a world where Palestine can exist as its own nation alongside Israel, it's just not under HAMAS. I still consider myself a Zionist even though I hold this belief, because I believe in the importance of Israel's continued existence. If you don't believe that Israel should be wiped out to make way for a Muslim nation and that Jews should have our own nation in the Holy Land, congratulations, you're a Zionist too. 

What do you believe the word means? Every definition I look up with credible sources says it's just somebody who thinks Israel should exist. Why is it being used as a slur against Jews? It doesn't even mean that we support the current Israeli government. I certainly don't; I think that once HAMAS is sufficiently dealt with, it's due for a change in leadership by a political party that wants to help transition Palestine into its own nation under its own non-theocratic government, but so many things need to change in order for that to happen, I'm not hopeful that it's possible. I am fearful of the future of the land that will be formally known as Palestine and its people, because under Netanyahu, the Israeli government might turn into the oppressive force against Muslims in Gaza and the West Bank that the Western far left thinks it already is."

Background:
This discussion is centered around two (2) regions currently under threat, but not for reasons that some would believe.

Kibbutzim Beeri
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
There are about 270 kibbutzim dotted across Israel. At their heart, kibbutzim are small towns (typically with somewhere between 100 and 1,000 residents) historically centered around collective farms. Beeri, located in the north-western Negev desert near the eastern border with the Gaza Strip, has become the crosshairs of a dispute between the Israeli government, and the Hamas led faction in Gaza. Israel to this day, has disenfranchised, segregated, deported the legal occupants, and has authorized its displacement with Jewish settlers. The UN General Assembly has demanded that Israel end ‚Äòunlawful presence‚Äô in Occupied Palestinian Territory. The resolution stems from the advisory opinion issued by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in July, in which the Court declared that Israel‚Äôs continued presence in the Territory ""is unlawful"", and that ""all States are under an obligation not to recognize"" the decades-long occupation. 

Crimea and Sevastopol
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Since 2014, when Russia illegally seized Ukraine‚Äôs Crimea Peninsula, the United States has rejected its attempt to change Ukraine‚Äôs borders by force. We have also repeatedly called out Russia and its proxies for their abuses and atrocities in Crimea and other parts of Ukraine.

Russia is employing the same playbook it used in Crimea in its attempt to seize and illegally annex additional areas of Ukraine, including sham referenda, forced Russification, installation of puppet authorities, and other illegitimate methods to impose its control through coercion, fear, and force. Today, we have an opportunity to reaffirm that Crimea is Ukraine and that Russia‚Äôs attempted annexation of Crimea and other parts of Ukraine‚Äôs territory will never be recognized. We will not stand silent as Russia continues its blatant violations of international law.

DISCUSSION
Do you agree (or disagree) that both crises are centered on land/culture differences?

Do you agree (or disagree) that the Israel/Russia governments) are in conflict with existing U.N. treaties?

This is specific to how we are to treat our neighbors.. You may need to read how David treated the inhabitants of the region, and the history of the Bedouin people.
Do you agree (or disagree) that the Negev region was legally occupied by Israel, and the expulsion of the people who lived there justified?

Regarding who are (and who are
not) terrorists, there are innocents on both sides. How can one support Israel and Russia too? Note: Both claim that they're defending their sovereignty. However, both are ignoring the calls for peace.

1. Hamas started this war and made a mess, they committed horrible crimes against humanity. Why won't you realize that and condemn that instead of some whataboutism about idf crimes?

2. Israel has no right to exist/ illegal colony - Fine, think whatever you want to think. But arabs have been fighting Israel for 76 years and failing against it. This years was no win for arabs either with Hamas and Hezbollah critically dismantled. legal or illegal you have to realize a nuclear armed country or 10 million with 700K soldiers is not going NOWHERE, you can shout it has no right to exist but that won't change anything in a hundred years.

3.Yes, there is anti semitism among arabs, deal with it. Holocaust denial, crimes denial of hamas and always blame the other side. This is childish, you have to agree at least on some degree Hamas and Hezbollah are held to a different standard and have committed war crimes as well.  

4. The pro palestine abroad is hurting palestine more than helps. I see hundreds of protests footage that shows vandalism, attacking individuals or businesses, shouting ""filthy jews"" or ""bomb them to the ground"" doesnt win synpathy among bystanders.

5. Mocking Oct 7 is childish and cruel. Many of you mock this day, mock the deaths, mock the civillians who were murdered (a recurring example is pictures of murdered women on X where arabs keep mocking the dead for their ""nose"" ""bangs"" or anything about the individual) TBH i have not seen pro israel people mock how dead palestinians look like in such a manner

  
6. ""All israelis do is lie"" is childish, grow a pair. I see the avoidance of arguments that don't fit a big disease among this crowd. I have never seen a single pro palestine person actually admit ""ok, not everything is morally right on our side"", this is a goddamn war and horrible things are done on both sides, stop seeing yourself as eternal victims.

I have to see I've been banned from every subreedit that is clearly anti israel / pro arab to the point of desperation, it seems like many of them do not want dialogue, only resistance (aka, fight until the jews die or gets expelled)

  
Seriously, why would bystanders support palestine if they witness points 1 - 5? This is NOT normal, and this attitude should change."
1fyyfjz,Iranian Support for Israel,2024-10-08 12:21:03,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fyyfjz/iranian_support_for_israel/,"Iranian support for Israel

Hi All. I wanted to gain a better understanding of the support of Israel some/many Iranians might have, as I have never come across this via the news.

I was at the 7/10 memorial march on Sunday in Manchester, England.

I was surprised to see so many Persian flags and a small but significant group of Iranians showing support for Israel.

They were holding up banners with lovely messages about Iran and Israe becoming allies. And some banners showing their hatred for the Ayatolla.

I understand some of the basic history about Iran and the revolution, following which it became a more extreme autocratic and religious nation. And I know many Iranians pray for a return to a more liberal and modern government.

But, I didn't know that this translated to overt support of Israel for some people with Iranian heritage.

This also makes me think about Netenyahu's recent video message directly aimed at the Iranian people, with words of admiration and hope.

By the way, the Iranians presence at the march was the most poignant things for me aboutvthe whole event. Me and several other Jews cried with and hugged these brave Iranians. One of the speakers acknowledged their presence and the whole crowd cheered so loudly. 

So, my questions are:

Can people help me understand the extent of this support from Iranians 

Does this include Iranians still living in Iran

How likely is a devolution back to the pre-revolution period in Iran.

See this recent article about the impact of the war: [https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/04/economy/israel-economy-war-impact/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/04/economy/israel-economy-war-impact/index.html) However, I am a bit more worried about the construction sector and what are the prospects of building so-called settlements in Judea and Samaria.



Even though the Jews have rightfully fired all the Palestinian construction workers after Oct 7th last year, I suppose there isn't any labour shortage for that because people from India and Sri Lanka are filling the gap. Along with that, Smotrich would continue to maintain subsidies for ultra-orthodox Jews and construction activities in Judea Samara. But, I'm wondering how long can that take place and would be interested to know people's opinions here.



A few questions for that:

1. Should Israel continue building in Judea Samaria at the moment while Hezbollah missiles are being fired at Haifa and even the center?

2. Should Israel also maintain any kind of subsidies in Judea Samaria for construction, land pricing, higher protection, etc.. while there is an economic downturn? One could also argue that there are several factories industries there which could churn out more revenue.

2. After the war is over soon, hopefully with the complete surrender of Hamas, defeat of the ""axis of resistance"" and the dismantlement of the Palestine Authority, would it make it very easy for economic recovery and also accelerate the settlement of Judea Samaria?

Written by a Syrian student, it sheds light on how campus activism can sometimes spread misinformation, especially around the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. The author shares a deeply personal story about how Hezbollah and Assad‚Äôs forces took over his family‚Äôs home in Damascus during the Syrian Civil War. His grandfather was beaten, and his grandmother was grazed by a bullet as they fled. At the hospital, they were denied treatment unless they signed a false statement, blaming opposition forces. This powerful account reveals how Hezbollah‚Äôs actions contributed to the suffering of his family and countless others.

The author argues that Hezbollah is not a liberation movement but part of Iran‚Äôs Islamist agenda, which has led to widespread destruction across Lebanon and Syria. He critiques how protests on campus and social media often frame Israel as the only aggressor, while ignoring the role Hezbollah plays in perpetuating violence. The article offers specific examples of misleading images and information used in protests, calling on students to question the narratives they are promoting.

The article provides a well-researched and insightful look into how these conflicts are far more complex than often portrayed. With reputable citations and a first-hand perspective, it‚Äôs an eye-opening read for anyone who wants to understand the true dynamics at play in the Middle East and how campus activism can sometimes fall into oversimplified, misleading narratives. Definitely worth checking out!

1fynw2k,Confirmation Bias on Hamas/Israel Conflict,2024-10-08 01:06:33,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fynw2k/confirmation_bias_on_hamasisrael_conflict/,"**Note: The information about to be provided is in no way or intent to attack or disregard one's personal beliefs on this issue. It is merely information that supports the idea of reflection, critical thinking, and logical reasoning. Some information may sound one sided but sometimes it happens.**  


Confirmation Bias is described as(multiple definition through a variety of sources): A cognitive/psychological bias that leads people to seek out, interpret, and favor information in a way that supports their own pre-existing beliefs on an issue/problem and disregarding/ignoring information that contradicts their values despite clear evidence. Different types of confirmation bias can include:

* Selective Searches: The activity of searching sources that support their existing/pre-existing beliefs. Some examples can include filtering out or avoiding sources/topics that contradicts their beliefs.
* Selective Interpretation: The activity of interpreting/receive information that aligns with one's own personal beliefs.
* Selective Memory: The activity of remembering information that supports one's own personal beliefs often intentionally disregarding other sources of information.

Pro's: When one searches for information that confirms one's own personal beliefs, it can lead to security and safety knowing that what they believe is true. It can also help one narrow/cut large amounts of information and focus on most relevant or meaningful experiences aligning with one's personal beliefs. And when sharing common beliefs with a particular group of people can also strengthen one's belief.

Cons: It can lead to misinterpretation and cause selective information that supports one's personal beliefs disregarding and ignoring information that are against it. It can also lead to polarization and lack of view points on all angles. It can create a narrow minded thoughts that can cause harm and can prevent growth and ability to change one's own beliefs when information that contradicts is received. 

How can confirmation bias affect the current Hamas/Israel conflict. An example, many western Christian with their personal beliefs believe Israel is the chosen people of God, therefore they believe that Israel will indeed be protected by God and that they will have their promise. Therefore they believe that they need to fully support Israel's campaign of Gaza Strip. On the other side with Muslims/Arabs they believe that the land is theirs and will do in any means to take that land and kill the Jews.

Confirmation bias creates a narrow tunnel vision view of the issue. Many Christians seem to support only Israel's side disregarding the lives being taken or how many Muslims/Arabs see Hamas as heroes that defend themselves from Israel. It is important to know that regardless of who is on what side, the lives of innocent women and children are being taken. On top of that, the hostages that have been taken have also been a key issue to this whole conflict. It is without a doubt that one needs to realize that one side is not rainbows and ribbons. Both sides are wrong, but both sides are right in certain things. Realize that it's important to seek information that is credible and reliable. But also take account that confirmation bias does exist and that it's important that everyone discuss such conflict in a meaningful and helpful conversation that doesn't lead to insults and attack on another person."
1fyncs9,"""Jewish Zionism"" and ""Settler-Colonialism"" - one of these things is not like the other",2024-10-08 00:39:56,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fyncs9/jewish_zionism_and_settlercolonialism_one_of/,"This was originally written as a response to someone dismissing Zionism and Israel as ""settler-colonialist"" and in so doing wanting to justify all acts of violent terrorism against its people up to and including October 7th... But it ballooned into something else, involving a few things that had been percolating in my head these past few years.

[(The original post in question)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fxawgn/comment/lqu4bin/)

In a nutshell: I think this entire line of academic thought is a large steaming pile of BS.

Putting aside the profound ancestral religious ties to the land, the fact that Israelites were once in control of a greater terrain than the borders of modern day Israel and Palestinian territories combined, that a Jewish presence remained in the Levant throughout most of the last 2000 years... (and that is certainly a bunch of pretty large things to put aside...)

...everyone in the world is a settler. You are, I am. No one lives on unsettled land. Even indigenous peoples in what is now known as the Americas crossed a land bridge in pre-history to settle in unoccupied land. Europe's borders were rewritten hundreds of times. Japanese wiped out an entire native population to extinction. Rome literally wrote whole civilizations out of the history books and, by extension, existence. Pakistan and India had a violent partition and population exchange around the same time as the founding of Israel, the expulsion of the Mizrahi, and the Nakba. Pretty much all of the Middle East, and certainly the Levant (before the European powers drew up some arbitrary borders) were made up of nomadic tribes following water sources and creating the odd 'settlement', all under one Imperial ruler or another they barely noticed.

It reminds me of that old truism about how all religions were once ""cults"". The only difference is time.

The way I see it, the modern use and scholarship of ""settler"" as a construct and subset of ""settler-colonialism"", was really just set up as a way to assuage white and/or Western guilt about the Americas' original founding sins of African slavery and Native genocide, or racist projects like Apartheid South Africa all the way back to the Crusades and everything else in-between. If you can tar someone else with the same brush, you can feel better about your own past.

What's worse is that the term ""settler"" is now being wrongly defined and used as a tool of de-legitimization, to achieve a slow erosion and destruction of the State of Israel, the only existing homeland for one of the modern world's most historically persecuted people, and in so doing justify any manner of evil done to them.

I find it hilarious every time I read one of these posts about ""debunking Zionist myths"" or whatnot that always start out by expressing shock (SHOCK!!) at early Israeli founders and Zionist leaders describing themselves as ""settlers"" or ""colonists"". The words themselves, ""settler/settlement"" and ""colonist/colony"", used to have positive connotations prior to the mid-1900s (quelle coincidence!) which is why so many of the Zionist founders described themselves as such, though they more often used the romanticized term ""pioneers"" (""chalutzim"", in Hebrew). These were not European robber-barons, arriving with warships on foreign shores to plunder natural resources and exploit the local population in order to enrich a home country. They had no real home. They were coming to SETTLE somewhere. And since Jews, by necessity, have had to live insular and semi-nomadic existences since the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, they formed self-sufficient COLONIES.

Would you also define the mass immigration of Syrians and refugees from other war-torn countries to Germany, France, etc. as ""settler-colonialism""? Because that's pretty much what happened in Israel in the first half of the 20th century. A large influx of immigration, followed by complex and screwy political calculations, followed by tension, followed by conflict. They haven't quite gotten to the conflict stage in Europe (mostly), but it's coming I'm sure.

To be admittedly flippantly reductive: there were Jews already living there, and they then had their friends come over and stay. Then others came when they were desperate and homeless, hearing it might be a good place to set up shop in safety. Then some of their neighbours got really annoyed at them for being there, so then the big European ex-Imperial superpowers (filled with guilt for mistreating both those peoples, as well as some choice opportunism) proposed a highly uncomfortable compromise. One accepted, the other refused. Yes, admittedly the Jews had less to lose, but I would argue that makes the deal all the more vital to accept for the other side. It was the ultimate Prisoner's Dilemma, and the Arabs got played. They should have known what the Jews would choose.

Fun fact: Israeli-born Jews call themselves ""sabras"", after the hard spiky desert cactus fruit. If the shame and misery of the Nakba is all it takes to justify suicide bombers, mass murders and kidnappings, how can you criticize what Israel has become socioculturally as a further response to those endless threats, and the implication that has on their often brutal-seeming military tactics?

In the end, it does really feel like what the Zionist Jews are really, truly guilty of... is gaining the upper hand for once. 'Damn uppity Jews! Daring to dream above their station!'

Certainly, Israel has done countless wrongheaded and awful things due to fear, politics, or just plain stupidity and/or arrogance (let's put this entire last year and much of the previous 20-25 under some combination of those categories). But I challenge you to name me any country under duress for it's entire existence that hasn't done a ton of those as well.

At the end of the day, whatever historical debate you want to have, the current reality is: Israel is established and has a right to exist, they are certainly not going anywhere, and their surrounding neighbours need to just accept that, or unfortunately die NOT trying. The same certainly applies to the Palestinians, and Israel needs to fully accept THAT.

Free Palestine! (From Hamas and Hezbollah!)

Free Israel! (From Netanyahu and the Kahanists!)

Free everyone else! (From my now ridiculously long rant!)

Peace."
1fym2wy,Had this discussion in texts with someone I know,2024-10-07 23:37:42,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fym2wy/had_this_discussion_in_texts_with_someone_i_know/,"So I had a bit of debate with buddy of mine in texts about the situation in Gaza, and was wondering what you all think about our points.  The conversation was about a doctor who had worked in Gaza and signed that letter recently to Biden.  This is how it went:

Me - So the thing is, even if someone is an American doctor, unfortunately, in order to work at all in Gaza's hospitals, one needs approval from Hamas.  Admitting that Hamas uses the hospitals would get them banned from working there.  An article from the Washington Post details how Hamas stores its weapons in some hospitals, and according to the Palestinian Authority, Hamas does that for the purpose of converting them into interrogation and imprisonment compounds

My friend - it‚Äôs been debunked. And they need approval from Hamas as in the government entity. The people who run the hospital, pick up the trash, do the duties of the local government are not the terrorist faction.

Me - It hasn't quite been dedunked.  As was pointed out, the Washington Post itself has confirmed that it's true.  What was debunked was the idea that Al-Shifa was being used as HQ, which was an overstatement.  Hamas is still known to store weapons in hospitals and such.  UNRWA published an article in 2014 that acknowledged such, which was titled ""UNRWA condemns placement of rockets, for a second time, in one of its schools"".  Since Netanyahu has been supportive of Hamas.  Hamas has a  history of using schools and hospitals for military activity and most people don't question that.  What's in question is just how much do they do that and how Israel should respond to that 

And yes, that's true, though the government entity Hamas is supportive of the terrorist faction.  Hamas, in its entirety, is a fascist group, with the same ideology and goals, whichever faction we're talking about.  They have the same policies as the militant faction (anti-LGBT, anti-women's rights, anti-dissent, etc), and they control what information gets out there from those employed by them.   Hence, it's hard to trust either somebody working on the Israeli side or someone working on the Gaza side, as both are censored to some extent or another

My friend - No what you‚Äôre speaking he‚Äôs been debunked on every level, by hospital personal, and Israeli investigations. Is a complete non starter that 0 evidence has ever been put forth of. And no, you‚Äôre just assuming here, most Palestinians support Hamas in so that they are their government, but not the terrorist faction this is often a racist conflation. And again, what you‚Äôre claiming here is doctors with long histories of work, who are not employed by Hamas are lying for Hamas. Anyone should understand how ridiculous this is, by this account we just can‚Äôt believe anything by anyone ever in Gaza. Everyone who has something sympathetic to say of the genocide happening in Gaza is not somehow Hamas. And what you‚Äôre saying isn‚Äôt even true in that israel controls the population registry in Gaza, not Hamas. Israel is who decides who and what goes in and out.

Me - Both the Washington Post and UNRWA have confirmed it to be true on some level or another.  Personally, I would say that the Washington Post is fairly reliable.  These particular doctors aren't currently employed by Hamas per se, though they needed to agree to Hamas's terms when they worked there, which likely include not discloses Hamas's activities, so any information they share might not be complete.  Sort of like how I wouldn't necessarily trust all of the information coming from a hospital that is regulated by the Kremlin.  The hospital itself isn't run the military wing of the Kremlin per se, but the it's still regulated by the Kremlin, so I'm more likely to take what they say about Ukraine with a grain of salt.  It certainly doesn't mean that we can't ever trust what's said by people in Gaza, but if it's said people who have been employed there, as long as Hamas is the government there, it might not be the fully truth.  I don't find the concept of Hamas using hospitals and schools that hard to believe, given that they are known to have little regard for the protection of human life

My friend - no they don‚Äôt have to coordinate with Hamas. And the people not letting reports come out is Israel who is blocking and censoring journalists. As a governing body Hamas has literally almost 0 power this is why the ICJ ruled Israel‚Äôs action still constitutes occupation. The only people these organizations are coordinating and answering to is the Israeli government. And once they‚Äôre back they have no restrictions as to what they can report on, I‚Äôve spoken to multiple of them at this point and I can assure you what you‚Äôre saying has no bearing on reality.

1fyluzi,Why do some people keep insisting that the Jews in Israel are Europeans ? ,2024-10-07 23:27:40,173,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fyluzi/why_do_some_people_keep_insisting_that_the_jews/,"It‚Äôs a difficult topic, I will ‚Äútry‚Äù to unpack it. 

1. Israel is situated in the Middle East, West Asia. I hope nobody dispute its geographical location. Egyptians are not Europeans, Jordanians are not Europeans, Lebanese are not Europeans, Syrians are not Europeans, Emiratis are not Europeans, Qataris are not Europeans, but some do consider Turkish people as Europeans and I can see why as Turkiye lies partly in Asia and partly in Europe.

2. Some of the people who keep insisting calling Jews in Israel as Europeans commented, because ‚Äúthey came from Europe‚Äù. 

Should we call all white Americans Europeans ? Is Trump a European ? Is Biden a European ? ‚Ä¶is that how it works ? So Denzel Washington is African ? Will Smith is African ? What if they had parents from different herritage / continents‚Ä¶what then ? How do you decide where ‚Äúthey came from‚Äù ? Was Steve Jobs a Middle Easterner (from his father side?) or was Steve Jobs a European ? (from his mother side?) Are none of them Americans ? Are Native Americans the only Americans ? Is that what you are trying to say ? Is Tiger Woods African (1/8), Asian (1/2), European (1/4) or Native American (1/8) ?

3. It is true some jews in Israel did fled Europe, fled from pogroms, persecution, holocaust and wars. Jews also went to America and elsewhere. You dont call those American Jews as Europeans do you ? You dont call Barbra Streisand European ? You call Barbra Streisand an American Jew or simply an American. Similarly why cant you call Israeli Jews as Middle Easterner, or simply an Israeli (not European). Why the difference ?

4. The majority of Jews in Israel today are called Mizrahi (Oriental or Eastern), they are the jews from Middle East and North Africa (Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, Lebanon, etc‚Ä¶). Many of them fled to Israel or were expelled from Middle East and North Africa from violence, war and persecution. Ben Gvir, far right Israeli politician is a Mizrahi Jew, his parents were Iraqi Jew and Kurdish Jew. They are not European. 

5. There are many other Jews such as Beta Israeli, also known as Ethopian Jews. They are not European Jews either. Jews in Israel are very diverse, coming from everywhere, Europe, Russia, Middle East, Africa, Asia, India, China, South America, Caribbean, etc‚Ä¶.and many inter-marriage between different Jewish groups.

6. 80% of Jews in Israel were born in Israel. Even Netanyahu was born in Tel Aviv on 21 October 1949. They are Israeli citizens not European citizens. Why call them Europeans ?

1fyekn5,a year of war and they want more...,2024-10-07 18:18:20,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fyekn5/a_year_of_war_and_they_want_more/,"Most Arabs and Jews want to live in peace, how come the region has been living in conflict for years?  
  
it is true that on the Palestinian side, there are radicals who do not want to admit that partition is necessary, because it is because of them that the Palestinians missed the UN partition in 1948;  
But the obstinacy and blindness are more on the Israeli side: politicians who do not care about the hostages and the IDF soldiers killed, wounded and disabled for life, much less the thousands of Palestinians killed, 

  
These extremists have trapped, through lies, certain Israelis in a vicious circle, a fallacious logic of inevitable war.   
In fact, these people have ideological obsessions that they put before human life,  
while ...life and man is the priority in all religions and in the writings of philosophers worthy of the name  
  
the reality on the ground has shown that the path of war is neither wise nor effective, a full year was not enough for IDF to control the Gaza Strip and Hamas after a year still manages to launch rockets  
Hezbollah is even more armed and more virulent than Hamas and Lebanon will not be pacified for years,  
Bibi lies that this will be the last war, there will be other October 7s, followed by other wars, until the extremists on both sides return to a serious peace process."
1fycx0v,"October 7th is Exactly Like Nat Turner's Rebellion, A Slave Revolt Against White Slave Owners and Their Families",2024-10-07 17:10:54,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fycx0v/october_7th_is_exactly_like_nat_turners_rebellion/,"A year on from October 7th, we learn that it was largely debunked. babies weren't beheaded or put in ovens, and children weren't tied up and burned. We also now know that Hannibal Directive was initiated that day (as per israeli sources) where a lot of the civillian death that day was caused by Israeli vehicles.

For the most part, the Hamas fighters were targeting IDF soldiers. They were able to kill about 500 of them. . As per sources, they started the attack by storming 12 different IDF bases, successfully incapacitating everyone inside. this is no doubt commendable and heroic. Its resistance. Its 100% justifiable. I don't see why it should be treated any differently to the Hatians revolting against the French, or George Washington and the Patriots killing British troops.

However it is true that some of the Hamas fighers did in fact kill some of the civillians intentionally. I have no problem in condeming it, it was wrong, and they will have to answer to God for what they did.

However if you look across history, every revolution, resistance, or fight against tyranny have war crimes and atrocious acts linked with them. That is just the reality of what resistance is. People just get so radicalized by the oppressing force they end up doing acts that are barbaric. But it would be absurd to suggest said oppressing force is a ""victim"".

Look no further than Nat Turners Rebellion in 1831. Long story short, Nat Turner, along with many other black slaves were able to revolt, murder their owners, and ended up going house to house freeing slaves, along with killing the white families of the households (including children).

The South's response was a carbon copy to what Israel did. Troops were sent and suppressed the rebellions and in the process killed hundreds of innocent black people who weren't even involved. The South subsequently enacted a slew of oppreseive policies on black people that further made their lives hell.

Just like Israel, the South went crazy with the propoganda making up a bunch of things that never happened. The narrative going around there was that the blacks had ""genocidal intent' and wanted to kill all white people.

It is important to recognize that both the Hamas fighers and black slaves who killed civillians were in the wrong and their actions were not by any means justifible. But it would be absurd to suggest this means the White slave owners or the Zionists are somehow ""victims"". No, they are both oppressive, racist regimes that caused the radicalization of these resistance fighters.

We can condemn indivdual crimes against humanity done during these rebellions while also acknowledging the wider picture that neither of these happened in a vacuum.

Zionists always wanted to deny israeli oppresion of gaza with ""we left in 2005"" rhetoric. Nope, they controlled the border, including their coastline, not letting anyone leave. Regulating everthing that went in and out. Poverty and unemployment rate was well over 50% in gaza. and all this ""there was a ceasefire on 10/6"" is just a load of nonsense. They were attacking Gaza just [**a few weeks**](https://www.npr.org/2023/09/24/1201381201/an-israeli-military-raid-has-killed-two-palestinians-in-the-west-bank) and [**a few days**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/04/gaza-strip-protesters-received-bullet-wounds-to-ankles-medics-report) **before 10/7**. These are just two examples, but Gaza, West Bank, Lebanon, and Syria get attacked by israel a lot more than you realize.

The sad truth is both the white slave owners and the zionist took advantage of their respective uprisings, made up a slew of fabrications and used them to justify oppression over millions of innocents who didn't even partake in their respective rebellions. No it wasn't because the white slave owners or the zionists were ""defending themselves"" like how they portray it, it was really just in the name of maintaining dominance and control. I am honestly  scared as to how these ""Greater Israel"" plans end up playing out.

its just unfortunate to see history repeating itself and seeing so many people still falling for false propoganda propogated by the mainstream media."

The atrocities committed along with their statements and charter makes it clear that they wish to inflict terror on a civilian population. But how come when Israels Gov does the same it‚Äôs not looked at in the same way? The Likud party has made it clear that ‚ÄúThe Government of Israel flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan river.‚Äù Which is outright the opposite of what we‚Äôve been getting told. I thought the Palestinians had a ‚Äúchance‚Äù in 2005 but when your neighbours gov says something like that and then imposes all kinds of laws and policies to make your life as hard as possible what chance did they really have? When members of your parliament spew genocidal rhetoric constantly with no repercussions what does that say about the so called democratic Israel? Here are some examples I find to be extremely worrying.

‚ÄúWe must remember what amalek has done to you‚Äù - Netanyahu

‚ÄúIf all of Gaza are refugees, then let‚Äôs scatter them in the world. There are 2.5m people there, each country would take in 20K people, 100 countries, it is humane, it is required,‚Äù -Ram Ben Barak, member of the Israeli Knesset.

‚ÄúThe entire nation is responsible. This rhetoric of 'unaware, uninvolved civilians,' is not true. They could've resisted, they could've fought this evil regime that took over Gaza.‚Äù - Herzog

‚ÄúBring down buildings!! Bomb without distinction!! Stop with this impotence. You have ability. There is worldwide legitimacy! Flatten Gaza. Without mercy! This time, there is no room for mercy!,‚Äù - Revital Gottlieb, a member of the Israeli Knesset.

‚ÄúNow we all have one common goal, erasing gaza from the face of the earth‚Äù - Deputy speaker of the Knesset Nissim Vaturi

I feel like these statements are so far gone and don‚Äôt represent how most israelis feel but I just want to know how some of you guys feel about statements like this.

Please dont copy and paste hamas statements im sure we all understand they have some terrible stuff to say but im talking about Israeli Gov comments towards Palestinians.

If anyones interested on learning more about the topic Norman Finkelstein does a great job at explaining it nice and slowly for everyone (A little too slowly sometimes) as hes been focusing on Palestine for the past 40+ years and has some great insight on the topic. You can always learn :).

This piece offers not just an unflinching view at how ugly things are today, it also seeks to answer the question of how we got to such a place. When it comes to the world‚Äôs oldest hatred, nothing is ever really new.

‚ÄúEverywhere I looked, over these past 12 months, far-left protestors not only tolerated but actively propagated centuries-old anti-Semitism, including celebrating the October 7th massacre and even praising Hitler. It was equal parts disgusting and confusing. How could a movement that, in theory, is supposed to oppose bigotry and racism have so openly embraced it? How did we end up with left-wingers attacking synagogues, creating lists of Zionists, canceling events with ‚ÄúZionist‚Äù participants, defacing Anne Frank memorials, and protesting Israel outside of Auschwitz? How could only half of young adults, by far the most left-leaning age group, disagree with the statement ‚ÄúThe Holocaust is a myth‚Äù? How did we get to a place where good progressives openly display swastikas, tell Jews to go back to Europe, express the desire to gas them, and perform Hitler salutes?

""The rhetoric was much the same as it had been for centuries: that Jews are violent, bloodthirsty, imposters ‚Äî not even Semitic, but a bunch of Europeans playing pretend. Demonstrators held signs with a Star of David in a trash can next to the words ‚ÄúKeep the world clean.‚Äù Classic anti-Semitic tropes like blood libel resurfaced. All of this happened within far-left movements, who now sound eerily like the far right. It‚Äôs no wonder that far rightists blend right in at pro-Palestine protests.‚Äù

From what I understand, Jews started buying the land in the 1900s, declared an Israeli state in 1948, Arab world didn't want that, so there were issues and then there were wars which Israel won and then there was a land distribution by the UN and more wars and then Israel started occupying the West bank and constructed a 20 foot wall around Gaza and locked them in. 

So can someone explain me what have the Palestinians done wrong except rejecting an Israeli state and wage war. I'm not sure how that allows the Israeli government to grab land in the West bank and to construct a wall in Gaza. "

I'm feeling extremely hopeless for the past year and was wondering if any of you have ever changed your perspective from more hate towards peace due to a conversation. I'm in college, and my life was literally devoted to fostering dialogue between interfaith groups and working towards ending prejudice in schools. I was the president of a nonprofit we created in high school and even took a gap year to develop it further.

I've met many incredible individuals from different faiths and had numerous conversations with students from all backgrounds. I have a unique perspective since my mom is Jewish (I grew up Jewish and practice Judaism), and my dad is Muslim. I'm used to feeling a little down after a hard conversation with someone but last year completely destroyed my faith in humanity.

In the days following October 7th, we held a vigil on campus. Some students arrived wearing face coverings, holding a poster depicting a H*mas militant next to a dead girl he had just killed. They held it for an hour while we prayed and cried, many of us uncertain about the safety of our loved ones. This moment broke something inside me. I looked into their eyes and I did not see anything other than terror.

I don't feel hatred toward anyone but I feel completely withdrawn. After witnessing such pure hatred (that was just the beginning I had the worst year of my life) I don't believe that anything l've worked for over the years made even a minimal impact. I resigned from my nonprofit position and no longer can bring myself to even go to a synagogue. My belief in God is almost nonexistent.

Sorry for the rant, but I guess I'm just wondering if anyone still thinks there is hope?

I will also not be doing it from the view of a active IDF soldier(or terroist, depending on how you see them) or Hamas terrorists, because they Are both, in my opinion, terrible at your goals and choosing what said goals are.

Imagine you‚Äôre a 17 year old Israeli teen boy, turning 18 in a few weeks, the age you will join the Israeli military.  You sit in your kitchen, worrying about another October 7th, or attack in general, that could kill you, or your friends, or your family.

You must to let the people see the elderly being pulled from rubble, and children crying over their dead parents.

Imagine you‚Äôre a 23 year old Lebanese man living in Ireland.  Your parents, you, and your siblings fled when you were young, leaving behind most of your relatives in Lebanon.  After the recent war started again on Lebanon, you are constantly calling your relative.  Do they need food, money, are they safe, are they planning on leaving the country, etc.  You worry the same thing will happen to Lebanon that has been happening in Gaza.

  
Imagine you are a 3 year old Israeli boy living in Tel Aviv. Your parents don‚Äôt explain to you why they rush you into a shelter when you hear a loud sound.  They don‚Äôt explain why they wear yellow ribbons.  They argue about if they should leave or not, but you don‚Äôt understand why they would want to leave.

  
Imagine you are a 15 year old Christian Palestinian girl in Gaza.  Your church was hit two months into the war.  Your house was destroyed hours after you were made to evacuate.  You first went to a family friend‚Äôs house, but then you were forced to evacuate again only after two weeks.  Then you lived in a tent, not the best thing to prevent you from the elements. You were cleared to go back one by the IDF, but when you got there, most or the building was in ruins.

  
Imagine your a 14 year old Palestinian boy in the West Bank.  Tension has been growing between your village and Israeli settlers.  Your Father believes that they will come after your family house and farm next.  Especially after your Uncle was attacked while arguing with the settlers about how he owned the land he lived on.  You want to inherit the farm and raise the next generation on the farm, but you fear Israeli settlers won‚Äôt allow it.

Imagine you‚Äôre a 32 year old Palestinian man living in Gaza. Despite it not being your job, you always find yourself helping people buried under rubble.  You can‚Äôt sleep at night after pulling out a dead young child out of the ruins of an apartment building, as her family wails at the news.

1fy1csn,We need to address a widespread lie about 8/10/23.,2024-10-07 06:37:37,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fy1csn/we_need_to_address_a_widespread_lie_about_81023/,"First of all, given the extremely charged atmosphere around this topic in particular, I have to come out and clearly denounce everything Hezbollah (and of course Hamas) has done over the past year. They are illegitimate extra-national militias who trade on fear and violence, and they have to be nipped in the knackers.

With that being said, there is an EXCEPTIONALLY common lie being spread by the Israeli political establishment, IDF, and a multitude of their rent-boys here on Reddit. 

That lie is that Hezbollahs rocket attacks on 8/10/23 were ‚Äúunprovoked attacks‚Äù - as opposed to the truth, which is that Hezbollah decided to use violence to show support for Hamas/opposition to IDF activity in Gaza.

The IDF began its strikes in Gaza at 10.46am on the 7th. Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/world/middleeast/timeline-gaza-israel-attacks-hamas.html
(non paywall: https://archive.is/drTRt) 

Hezbollah fires its first rocket salvo into northern Israel at ‚Äúaround sunset‚Äù on October the 8th. Source: https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-border-rockets-hezbollah-42f3fb7798f0b1d705f43f36debe7bb8

Their stated justification was in ‚Äúretaliation‚Äù for those IDF strikes. Abhorrent behaviour, yes, but not ‚Äúout of the blue‚Äù in the way the pro-war folks are presenting it.

The idea that Hez jumped at the chance to kick Israel while it was down, and its actions therefore share a moral equivalence with Hamas‚Äô the day before is deliberately misleading and is disingenuously creating the impression that the behaviour of both groups can be treated as a monolith of aggression.

It cannot, and repeating this lie is intended to manage the perception of Israel‚Äôs pattern of escalation as mere response - while, in reality, it is patently obvious that Israel has calculated that now is the time to flip the geopolitical table, thereby grossly overshooting their mandate to ensure security for their own citizens at the minimum possible cost to civilians and civilian infrastructure in the region."

Throughout the past year, I've held strong to my values, however, some things have changed for me.

Most specifically, the UNWRA at War video someone shared. I used to trust them a whole lot, but after watching that and confirming the translations, it has made me more wary of that organization. ETA: Now that I think about it, I've become more wary of all humanitarian organizations now. These things are run by humans, and humans are easily corruptable.

Most broadly, it has made me essentially lose all trust in my own government. I used to identify very heavily with the democrats, but over time (prior to this all), I started questioning them. But after this, I've gotten more and more vehement about reducing military spending; I want the U.S. to pull out (üòè) of foreign nations and mind our own business (except humanitarian disasters, in which we could either loan or donate to whatever area has had the disaster). I, essentially, see both major parties to be threats to Americans' lives and wellbeings at this point.

From what I've gathered is that Britain promised that if the Palestinians helped in their fight against Germany, who at the time were aligned with the Ottoman Empire, they would give them independence. 

The Palestinians helped in the conflict, and after the Ottoman Empire was defeated and so were the germans with the help of the Palestinians what happened was that they saw fit the support of jews also to defeat the germans and once it was all over they divided the country, of course giving jews many rights and in sorts lying to the Palestinians. 

  
What I dont understand is all the hate Israel is getting, I mean the whole world is divided by boarders which were formed from historical wars and treaties. I can't think of one country which wasn't invaded, the only difference is Israel might be the only one who didn't colonise anything, they were simply granted access by the British government because they had nowhere else to go. 

What is the difference (other than the fact jews didn't colonise Palestine like all the other countries have done in the past in wars) between Israel being there and all the other boarders? Furthermore, I don' understand why Arabs have 3 billion people and jews only 15 million yet they cant be granted a home, if the Arabs fight so hard for Palestine then surely they can grant them hospitality I mean the Arab world is big enough, and this war doesn't seem to be ending anytime soon.

It‚Äôs my understanding that a day after israel was established the Palestinians and their resistance groups invaded israel with the help of other arab nations and that their end plan was to establish a jew-free Palestinian state throughout all of what was mandatory Palestine. Although instead israel won, egypt annexed gaza and jordan the west bank after the 1949 armistice agreement (with the agreement of the Palestinian population in the west bank). Then the Hashemite kingdom decided to make the west bank a part of jordan and Palestinian nationalism largely died out until 1967 during the start of the israeli occupation. 

Also was jordan supposed to move its forces into the west bank after the British withdrew to help establish and secure a Palestinian state using the arab legion?

I have every incentive to support Israel but can‚Äôt ignore the similarities between the 2 situations. October 7 was an attack by extremist Palestinians in response to their people being forcibly removed from their homes and treated as less than Israelis. The Native American extremists also killed civilians in response to having their land stolen and being treated as less than Europeans as seen in the 1622 Powhatan Uprising in Virginia for example. Both Israelis and European colonists were given the best military equipment from the most powerful Western nations resulting in conquest of the land which benefited the top Western powers economically. Using Israel‚Äôs victory in wars against the Arabs trying to take their homes back as an excuse for further annexation is equivalent to European colonialists using Native American wars for their land back as an excuse to take further land and push them West. Manifest Destiny and Zionism both seem to come from the believe that God gave you the right over a land. The two situations obviously differ in some ways but overall are very similar. What am I missing? How is Israel more justified in their taking of land in the Middle East as Europe is justified in their taking of Native American land?

Do they want to stop the war when their enemy doesn't want to stop?

Do people have a better way to stop muslim violence against them?

What are they disagreeing on with government?


P.s: Ok I think I kinda found out 

I thought people are always talking in terms of war politics and I unintentionally considered that inner politics are perfect in Israel something that isn't possible

And I know Israel originates from keeping people safe but their whole life isn't fighting and must not be now I know that beside fighting their enemies they are trying to have an active country too and they try to complain to make things better and even change them .

However, the letter also makes, reiterates, and elevates into a centerpiece of its policy demand a new **casualties estimate**, for which it claims to provide ""probative evidence"":

> This letter and the appendix show probative evidence that the human toll in Gaza since October is far higher than is understood in the United States. It is likely that the death toll from this conflict is already greater than 118,908, an astonishing 5.4% of Gaza‚Äôs population.

I have a nasty habit: when someone makes an extraordinary claim and says they can back it up with evidence, I actually go read the evidence.

---

#The ""evidence""

First of all, no evidence of this death toll is to be found in the letter iteself, in spite of the wording of the paragraph announcing it. It is simply not there.

The ""evidence"", such as it is, is contained in the appendix:

https://static1.squarespace.com/static/66e083452b3cbf4bbd719aa2/t/66fcd754b472610b6335d66f/1727846228615/Appendix+20241002.pdf

The first line that touches on the Gaza death toll is this:

> The Lancet, the most prestigious medical and public health journal in the world, recently published estimates from American, British, and Canadian experts on the likely toll this conflict has taken: ‚Äúit is not implausible to estimate that up to 186,000 or even more deaths could be attributable to the current conflict in Gaza.‚Äù

This an infamous and long-debunked lie. What they're referring to is a [letter](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(24\)01169-3/fulltext) published in Lancet, wherein doctors provide an estimate of the total *future* death toll from the Gaza conflict, setting it at ""at least"" 186,000. The method by which they derive this number is to look at recent conflicts, calculate the multiplier between conflict deaths and total deaths, and then applying this multiplier to the Gaza war. It is shoddy methodology that doesn't look at the actual conditions- for example, ignoring the unprecedented humanitarian efforts going into Gaza - and doesn't rise to any standard of rigour that would see it fit for publication as an actual scientific study (hence why it's a letter).

In spite of these serious flaws, not only was this letter amply propagated in anti-Israeli media, but its claims were made even stronger: like the authors of these appendices do now, the number 186,000 is turned from an estimate of total *future* deaths into an estimate of deaths *so far*. There is no ambiguity in the original paper, and this 'mistake' in reporting has been amply pointed out over the months, yet they still repeat it. How can we take them seriously, and see them as honest actors, when they engage in the basest disinformation?

---

#The Ministry of Health of Gaza's ""reliable figures""

The appendix then moves into forming its own estimate, starting with the Ministry of Health of Gaza's figure of 41,495 dead. The authors omit to mention that this figure makes no distinction between military and civilian deaths; they go on to argue that the figure itself is reliable, and should be if anything treated like a lower bound estimate.

However, we've known for a long time that MoHG figures are [not reliable](https://www.commentary.org/articles/david-adesnik/gaza-health-ministry-casualty-data/). They show evidence of gross statistical manipulation, such as the death toll increasingly in a perfectly linear fashion day by day, which indicates that it's not an actual measurement, but an extrapolation.

The letter's authors make one shockingly false claim:

> The Gaza Health Ministry only reports deaths caused directly by violence that arrive at a hospital morgue.

This is completely false in a frankly bizzarre fashion. MoHG has openly admitted that a portion of its figures come from ""reliable media sources"". MoHG itself does not claim to only count deaths ""directly by violence that arrive at a hospital morgue"": the letter's authors choose to claim it for them. This is another deliberate lie: there is no possibility that people who've even superficially study the issue could honestly make this mistake.

---

#The ""dead buried under the rubble""

After discussion the MoHG figures, the appendix argues to add 10,000 more dead, ""buried under the rubble"". They cite this claim to this source:

https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/05/1149256

This is not a study of any kind, but a UN News article. The number is provided by an OCHA spokesperson without reference to its source, methodology, let alone evidence. There is simply nothing here to back it up, yet this is passed off as ""probatory evidence"" and the figure is added to the final count.

---

#The ""deaths from malnutrition""

The most shocking and bizarre manipulation comes in the second-to-last section, discussing deaths from starvation. The argument, and please read it for yourselves on page 5 if you think I'm making this up, is this:

- the IPC has released estimates of which IPC phase Gaza has reached, period by period

- these IPC phases are supposed to correlated to a minimum death rate from starvation

- therefore, we will apply this death rate by starvation and assume this is how many people died of starvation, even though the actual data is orders of magnitude lower

Again, don't just believe me, look at the text. They literally *start from the conclusion*: rather than look at the starvation death rate and check if the claimed IPC phase makes sense, they assume the IPC phase must be correct and claim tens of thousands of extra, unreported deaths as a result.

These aren't deaths ""under the rubble"", they aren't missing persons. These are thousands and thousands of extra dead people that would likely have been taken to hospitals, that would have died in medical care or at least the care of their loved ones, that would fill tens of thousands of graves or large mass graves. Even in Gaza's conditions, it would simply be impossible to miss this, yet this is precisely what is claimed: somehow, the Gazans forgot to report about over 60 thousand starvation deaths, as did the IPC, WFP and all other relevant authorities.

---

#Deaths from infectious disease and lack of medical care

This section is as confusing and even more vague than the previous ones. It does not provide any clear claim to the number of additional ""uncounted deaths"", but we can deduce by difference that they estimate an extra 5,000 uncounted deaths. Again, these would be people who died in hospital or in the care of loved ones, people who would be mourned and buried. It would be impossible to miss 5,000 extra gravesites or mass graves for another 5,000 people, yet the authors claim this is exactly what must have happened.

---

#Conclusion

This is a dishonest, manipulative, and frankly bizarre letter. It mixes in heart-wrenching anecdotes with authoritative-sounding claims of a well-evidenced death toll nearing 3x the official one. Yet the estimates that drive this claim range from shoddy methodology to literally non-existent evidence. There is nothing here approaching the level of ""evidence"", let alone ""probatory evidence"". And it is extraordinary that a hundred medical professionals, with hands on experience in this war and likely contacts and sources that could help them do better, only managed to come up with little support for their claims.

The bare minimum expectation, based on the wild claims they make, is that they provide some evidence. They claim over 70 thousand extra unreported deaths: they could show us some of the unknown or undercounted burial sites, given cameras are widely available in Gaza and footage gets out of the Strip daily. They could coordinate with NGOs, or even with MoHG itself, to provide a count of these unknown grave sites and the people buried therein, showing that it lines up with their extraordinary claims. Dead bodies don't diseappear, and they would stand in unquestionable evidence of their claims... if they could find them.

There are two possibilities here: either the most basic steps of forensic medical investigation are somehow beyond the 100 experts that signed this letter, or they chose to forego them because they know the evidence any rigorous investigation would reveal would not line up with their claims.

All in all, this seems like yet another ""atrocity study"" out of the anti-Israel propaganda machine, backstopped by ""experts"" that put their credibility on the line with the expectation that their titles will awe most people, and that their claims will be acritically circulated and repeated far more than any contrary analysis. After all, by the time the truth laces up its shoes, a lie has run a lap around the world."

This is something i really want to get peoples opinions on, The comments on the video are (mostly) praising this guy for in my opinion: harassing these pro Israeli guys. Im jewish and was brought up in a jewish family and to no surprise I do support Israel. That does not mean I like their government. I also have sympathy to the Palestinian families who are suffering because of this war. It is terrible on both sides. However I really do not like the protesters.  on one day they came to my area on a friday while i was attending synagogue it was cancelled and this caused a lot of anger towards the people who came to us. I am a person of forgiveness though and they did apologise for cancelling the religious activities. 



  
I really just want this war to be over and the hostages to be returned (although every day that passes I have less hope.) What does disgust me is the people who pull down posters of hostages and the violent protest in Melbourne against the police and the arms expo. I attended a jewish school and then moved to a catholic one. I have seen 2 sides of the argument and both of them are correct (except the extremists both sides included) This guy did post on his instagram that ""All zionists are terrorists"" which really angers me because clearly this bloke has no idea what he is talking about. I really am surprised how this guy can shout at others without having a dead voice. Thank you for reading and have a good day/night. "

To the rest of the world, surely this only looks like you're celebrating the massacre that took place on the 7th of October.

The only explanation I can imagine for demonstrating is if you believe the massacre didn't take place, and that Hamas only targeted the IDF on the 7th of October (which is something I know many Pro Palestinians believe).

So perhaps war between the two is one of the worst ideas ever. Everyone, except seemingly Netanyahu has heard of mutually assured destruction. The idea that if two nuclear powers go to war, it will be the last war ever. In such an event, Israel would probably defeat Iran, and the far right Persian leaders would likely launch nukes so they could at least take out Israel as they are defeated. And that is an event that sounds a little bit like a 2nd Holocaust, which I'm told Israel was created to prevent. 

So if you are Israeli, Persian, Jewish, or Muslim, or any other nationality or religion, I would hope this sounds like a bad idea to you. Even Islamists and Kahanists probably understand that nuclear war is a disastrous idea.

In the midst of the tug of war (no pun intended) between Palestinians and Israelis since all the way back from the British mandate where discussants have been too busy debating ‚Äúwho started it first‚Äù like 8 year old elementary kids, one major question remains unanswered:

How do Palestinians contend with the inherent disregard for human rights as clearly evidenced by their humiliating attitudes and beliefs toward women, even in their own culture? Whether religiously motivated or not the blatant subjugation of A HUMAN BEING, born a ‚Äúwoman‚Äù, in the greater Palestinian & by extension in almost all Arab communities & by extension in almost all Muslim communities, is the elephant in the room no one is addressing. 

To those folks ignoring this utter injustice: How many more millennia do you want to ignore this obvious flaw in your customs and beliefs?

And more importantly, if you continue to allow this humiliating unfairness toward your own kin to continue unchecked, why do you believe third parties are going to take you seriously when you cry for help as a people being  subjugated and treated unfairly? Don‚Äôt you think you would have more credibility if you started to treat your own folks with more respect and caring?

Both Israelis and Palestinians are nationalistic to a large degree, and the desire to help your country in a war effort are understandable.

However, the way Palestinians view death is quite interesting and different than the way Israelis do - which is more Western-normative.

The ""quest"" or desire to become a martyr, that is *to die or be sacrificed* rather than simply achieve some sort of combat-related goal (or even kill one's enemy) seems to have a very special meaning for Palestinians in a socio-political context that affects the social standing of the martyr himself, widows, orphans, relatives, and even the neighborhood/village. The same social system seems to have propped up within the Hezbollah faithful.

Some questions are:

1. Is the elevated status of a martyr based in Islam?

2. To be a martyr, does one need to die while facing the enemy? what about a civilian who dies in an airstrike?

3. Money is part of the martyrdom culture - martyrs and their families receive generous benefits from Palestinian leadership -  but if the money stopped, would the belief waver? Is there any proof or historical precedent here?

4. To what extent if any is the martyrdom concept a tool employed by the Palestinian elites to cynically use lower-class Palestinians as cannon fodder/political pawns?   
5. Do any civil or religious elements of Palestinian or greater Arab/Muslim society reject the quest for martyrdom?

1fwx7il,Yahyah's Sinwar's Novel and the relationship between him and academia that influences the West,2024-10-05 18:41:28,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fwx7il/yahyahs_sinwars_novel_and_the_relationship/,"I recently learned that Yahyah Sinwar wrote a novel which has recently been translated to English.

Now, I'm not about to pay any money in support of that individual and so I have not read the English translation. If you're interested though, you can find it [here](https://www.amazon.com.au/Thorn-Carnation-Part-I/dp/1445766728?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=A4XRJ8S0WXSO0). It has been translated by a group based in Algeria known as the TASQ Company and their catalogue is ... interesting.

Tarif Khalidi and Mayssoun Sukarieh were kind enough to post a book review in impeccable English [here](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/02/leader-of-the-underground-tells-all/). If you're interesting in tracing how academia has coupled with and channeled a sympathetic view towards the man responsible for the massacre of October 7 and the subsequent suffering of the Palestinian people, this is worth reading through a critical lens.

It suggests a retelling of history in which the frame of 'resistance to occupation' takes precedence over Islamist impetus, and at least in the review there is a claim that Hamas does not actually hate the Jews.

*The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears.*

It is this sort of publication that is intended to reach the western academic audience and is designed to reinforce the view that the conflict from the Palestinian perspective is in fact just and righteous.

Although I would ideally do a literary criticism of the original text, this review provides an interesting case study in order to understand how information can be sanitized, repackaged, and delivered to a receptive  audience on which ignorance is imposed through omission and deflection.

They use their own mythical religious texts to justify this. They say the land was ‚Äúpromised‚Äù to them by god.¬†

This, they say, is why they have a right to the land.¬†

Yet, they did not have a nation in that land for almost 3000 years before 1948, the date modern Israel was created.¬†

And on top of that, their own mythic religious text explicitly states that the land was occupied, lived in, and claimed as a home by other groups before they arrive and their god ordered them to take the land by force. So their claim over the land is that they stole the land through force of violence in the late 11th century BCE.

In other words, they have no claim over the land at all. It‚Äôs a land they stole by violent force and then reoccupied through political maneuvering and violence almost 3000 years later.

Their own actions give legitimacy to the use of violence to occupy the land. Whomever can take the land from them is the rightful possessor of the land, according to their own actions and philosophy.¬†

In other words, according to Israel's own logic, if their neighbors can take the land through violence, it is theirs by right.

1fwm1sm,"Why is violence only ""resistance"" when committed by ""Palestinians"" or enemies of Israel?",2024-10-05 08:48:04,176,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fwm1sm/why_is_violence_only_resistance_when_committed_by/,"I'd rather just let the headline do the talking, but here I am, having to write a couple of words about it.

For one thing, what baffles me is the insistence on the relevance of the numbers of victims on each side. No number of victims whatsoever can say anything about where the boundaries between terrorism, resistance and warfare lie. Three thousand victims of 9/11 don't make terrorism war, while only 907 victims altogether still allow the conflict over the Falklands to be called a war.

Obviously Israel militarily is a behemoth compared to any military force directly associated with Palestine. Obviously, if one party in a conflict fights, it has to use any means at its disposal, which would be fighting guerilla-style by Hamas, using any advantage like mingling with the population and using any cover available, be it ""civilian"" housing or infrastructure. I don't see a reason to condemn tunnel-building as a means to try and win a war. In fact, my personal view about warfare is that fighting inefficiently is one of the most inhumane things to do when the decision to fight has already been made, and violence is already in full swing. Putting aside whether Hamas fighting this war is justified, reasonable or constructive by any means, I acknowledge the point that what is being called terrorism may be labelled as resistance - if only in parts.

Rape is non-disputably not resistance, as well as the deliberate targeting of non-combatants, or people who can't be expected to be combatants anytime soon.

If terrorism could be expected to have the effect that enemies could be forced to surrender, I would even accept that as a means of resistance, though I have the highest doubt that any such formula has any merit.

That being said, why is it generally accepted that the underdog's actions can be labelled resistance, while at the same time the perceived overpowering faction, in this case Israel, is being accused of war crimes and atrocities for actions committed in response to so-called ""resistance""? How is it that only one party should claim resistance for its fight when both parties obviously struggle for their existence?

Compared to historical attempts to wipe out all Jews, and the alliance of enemies now trying to kill as many Jews as possible and wipe out Israel, namely and foremost Iran, and with it much of the Muslim world could be seen as the Behemoth, or in the biblical comparison, the Goliath.

What is so different about Israel, or the ways it fights for its existence, that the term resistance can't be applied to what the Israeli government, the IDF and the Mossad do? "

 So, we have seen a rise in antisemitism since 2016. With the Proud Boys sporting shirts that say ""6 million wasn't enough"", or Charlottesville neo-Nazties chanting ""Jews will not replace us"". MTG's whole controversy about ""Jewish Space Lazers"", and the entire dog whistles with conservatives referring to our problems being caused by ""Globalists"", or ""George Soros"". We all know what they mean when they state those claims. Lots of conspiracy theories that make no sense eventually find their way to antisemitism. It's wild seeing what people believe. Then you have the ""Great Replacement Theory"", in which it states that Jews are flooding the country with immigrants and encouraging race-mixing in order to ""exterminate the aryan race"".

 As of recent, I think the right has been cashing in on the Israel/Palestine situation from various fronts. 


  But before we get to this, I think there are 2 forms of antisemitism at play here. One is more nefarious, the other is mostly a reaction to the given situation. 

 Antisemitism from the right is often what I consider, old-school European antisemitism. The right has more practice in trying to push antisemitism in the most subtle ways possible. Like I stated above, they often use dog whistles and try to give themselves plausible deniability. So they can gaslight anyone that has caught on to their game. It's nefarious and devious because they figured out how to push it into the mainstream. People buy it without realizing it. Whenever they hear globalists, they don't understand what the right really means. Those that are in on it, tap their nose and nod. Those who are not in on it and politically illiterate, buy it without knowing much of what it means. European/American antisemitism has a long list of books and wacky conspiracies about Jews that are borderline schizo. It's an entire school of thought (or more accurately, lack of thought).

 On ""the left"", it is not the exact same. And I put ""the left"" in quotes because you can't really claim to be part of the left and believe the Jews are responsible for this situation as if they're a monolith. It's antithetical to left-wing ideals. It's probably better to say, antisemitism from the arab world. Where does it come from? Well, I'd say it's more of a reaction by people who know too little. They see bombs drop, they see the Star of David on the Israeli flag and in their minds they put 2 and 2 together. It's how it manifests in groups like Hamas. Because like white supremacists, religious leaders are quick to recruit people who are in dire situations. They give them an enemy and a chance for retribution. More educated people know it's not Jews. In fact, the blame goes all the way to US Imperialist motives.

 I wouldn't even call antisemitism on the pro-Palestinian side ""left-wing"", because if you're an antisemitic Muslim that hates the Jews, you are right-wing. By virtue of your beliefs coming from a religious perspective. The left often doesn't like organized religion.

 Often people accuse the left of being ok with Muslims who would commit atrocities. Not really, they are more concerned with left-leaning people from the arab world escaping right-wing extremist Muslims.

 The sad thing about the Gaza/Israel situation is that Israel is claiming to do this in the name or ""protecting a Jewish state"". It essentially implicates all Jews around the world. Because let's face it, humans are very prone to reacting and not thinking. So it fuels antisemitism. 


 Now there are a few fronts the right likes to open when it comes to antisemitism.

Pro-Israel antisemites: 

- People who see Jews and Israel as a means to an end. They are often Evangelical Christians. In fact, they are the biggest donors of Aipac. They believe Israel is where the battle of Armageddon is supposed to happen. So they are hell-bent on defending Israel, not out of love for Jews, probably not even out of hatred for Arabs, but out of the idea of being sucked into heaven when Jesus comes back according to their prophecy. *And according to their prophecy*, everyone else burns in eternal fire, including the majority of Jews (some are supposed to convert to Christianity, implying Jew is the wrong religion).

- People like Richard Spencer who admire Israel as a blueprint for a white-only ethnostate. He admires how Israel deals with Palestinians, and wishes he could do the same to minorities in the US and in Europe. People like him also see Israel as a place to exile Jews to. To him, he sees it as ""Wow, there's a place in the Middle East we can send Jews away to? And they'll willingly go? And on top of that they they kill arabs? We didn't even ask for that, but it's a bonus! I'll take it!""

- People who are antisemite but hate Arabs more than Jews. That's pretty self-explanatory right there.

 Then there are anti-Israel antisemites:

- Nick Fuentes, just hates Jews, hates Israel, and anything to do with Jews. Not much else to say about that piece of booger-eating trash.

- Right-wingers who hate Arabs, but hate Jews way more. So they jump on the pro-Palestinian side while still thinking of Arabs as ""sand-N-Words"".

- actual pro-Palestinians that aren't really educated and end up adopting right-wing antisemitism. 

 There are also often right-wingers who play both sides. Egging them on because what better for a person who hates both Jews and Arabs to watch them kill one another?

 So oftentimes, we can see antisemitism as a canary in a coal mine. To see where your country is going. If you are pretty well versed in right-wing talking points, you can catch what they say. You know their point of view is eventually gonna lead towards ""it's the Jews"".

 But I also see it as a frame of reference for how other minorities are scapegoated. Such as how the Haitians have been demonized in the states. Or immigrants as a whole. In fact, the whole pet-eating controversy pushed by JD Vance originates from a neo-Nahztie group called ""Blood Tribe"". Same with the LGBTQ community. Remember the last general election when the right was all about how there's a big ""trans agenda"". Making it seem like there's a big ""trans cabal"" that is trying to trans your kids. Funny enough, it eventually leads right back to them accusing Jews of doing it. This is why I sympathize with Jewish people feeling unsafe. Then there is how I see people refer to Palestinians as animals or anything else than human. I've seen someone post that they are a ""cancer of humanity"", or calling them an ""infestation"". Sound familiar? That's similar to when the Jews were referred to as ""vermin"". Although the people who posted that were not Jewish themselves (I highly doubt it). 

 As for people in Israel, Jews and Israelis aren't a monolith. There are Jews who are against what Israel is doing, some even claim that it's a sin for Israel to exist because it's not supposed to happen until the messiah comes back and tells the Jews to build Israel(someone check me on this, I'm just stating what I heard). There are Israeli Jews who are against what Israel is doing. And then there are right-wing Israelis like Likud and many settlers who adopted the same mindset of white nationalists. Anyone can become right-wing, anyone can become fascist.

 The atrocities in Rwanda? They invoked similar rhetoric to justify genocide. 


 But ya, my conclusion is that yes, antisemitism can pop out from Palestinian movements. But those are easy to squash. Because they stick out like sore thumb.

 Right-wing antisemitism is more on the low, and often pretends to be the opposite. 

Oh ya, also watch out for people that say ""Cultural Marxism"", that's a play on the phrase ""Jewish Bolshevism"". Organizations like Breitbart often accuse George Soros of spreading ""Cultural Marxism"", or even accuse the Frankfurt School which has many Jewish members. 

Some food for thought:
 
Antisemitism in regards to the right accusing Soros of every bad thing that ever happens:

How the right wants Palestinians to be killed while hiding behind Jewish people because they expect Jews to do the dirty work for them. If your Jewish, they are not your friends. They want blood on your hands so they can keep their hands clean:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVH8o3A7r9c&list=PLaEl7RAFG5xaX493GWn7yGmmjuqb_XP5D&index=14&pp=gAQBiAQB


 As for me, I always called out antisemitism. I correct people who try to refer to the Jews when it comes to Israel and Palestine. I call out people who spew antisemitic conspiracy theories. I despise both Islamaphobia and Antisemitism. Those 2 mentalities often are a good determination of how bigoted someone is."
1fwj40w,The Axis of Resistance Doesn‚Äôt Exist‚ÄîIt's Just the Axis of Eradication,2024-10-05 05:14:53,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fwj40w/the_axis_of_resistance_doesnt_existits_just_the/,"**The Axis of Resistance Doesn‚Äôt Exist‚ÄîIt's Just the Axis of Eradication**

**Iran's Role: Pushing Gaza Off a Cliff**

Alright, let‚Äôs be real here: there is no such thing as an ""Axis of Resistance"" when it comes to Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, and their buddies. This isn‚Äôt some righteous defense of land or freedom; this is an ""Axis of Eradication."" It‚Äôs time we stop buying into the euphemisms and start calling this absurdity for what it is. The reality? Iran and its allies just want Israel dead‚Äîplain and simple.

Iran loves to paint itself as the grand protector of Palestinians, fighting against oppression. But here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîIran got Gaza in trouble, and then sat back as people paid the price. They‚Äôve been arming Hamas for years, shipping weapons into Gaza, and encouraging exactly the kind of horrific attacks we saw on October 7. Khamenei himself called it ""logical and legal,"" as if the massacre of civilians was some moral high ground. It‚Äôs not resistance; it‚Äôs pure, calculated violence. And what‚Äôs their response when Israel fights back? They act shocked‚Äîoutraged that Israel would dare defend itself. It‚Äôs like they pushed Gaza off a cliff and then acted surprised when they hit the ground.

**The Absurdity of Blaming Israel**

Think about the irrationality here: Iran supplies weapons, encourages violence, orchestrates an attack‚Äîand then blames Israel when things inevitably go sideways. This isn‚Äôt defense; this is exploitation. They use Gaza as a pawn, knowing that the people there are going to face unimaginable suffering when Israel retaliates. And then Iran has the audacity to turn around and say that Israel is the real aggressor? That‚Äôs not just absurd‚Äîit‚Äôs cruel.

**Iran's Real Intentions: Instigation, Not Defense**

And let‚Äôs be honest: Iran isn‚Äôt interested in a better future for Palestinians. They‚Äôre not funding schools, hospitals, or any kind of infrastructure that would improve lives in Gaza. They‚Äôre funding rockets, weapons, and tunnels. They‚Äôre not resisting; they‚Äôre instigating. They‚Äôre happy to let Hamas provoke a response, watch Gaza suffer the consequences, and then use that suffering to fuel even more hatred and violence against Israel. It's all part of their sick game, where innocent people are nothing more than pieces on a board.

**Who Pays the Price? Gaza Does**

If anything, Iran has made things worse for Gaza. The people of Gaza didn‚Äôt ask for this. They didn‚Äôt ask to be dragged into a proxy war that‚Äôs all about Iran flexing its influence against Israel. Iran created this situation, armed Hamas, let October 7 happen, and now wants to act like they‚Äôre the noble defenders of Palestinian lives. But the truth? They don‚Äôt care about those lives. They care about destroying Israel, and if Gaza has to burn to make that happen, then so be it. That‚Äôs the cold, hard reality of the ""Axis of Eradication.""

**Israel: Cleaning Up Iran's Mess**

And for Israel? They‚Äôre left with no choice. They have to defend themselves, because they‚Äôre facing enemies who don‚Äôt just want to push back‚Äîthey want to wipe Israel off the map. Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas‚Äîthey‚Äôre all in this for one goal: eradication. That‚Äôs not resistance. That‚Äôs not about land or sovereignty or freedom. That‚Äôs about revenge, about annihilation. And until we all start seeing it for what it is, we‚Äôre not getting anywhere close to understanding what‚Äôs really happening.

**Call Out the Hypocrisy**

It‚Äôs time we stop pretending there‚Äôs any moral equivalence here. Iran‚Äôs hypocrisy is staggering, their manipulation is cruel, and their endgame is clear. The so-called ""Axis of Resistance"" is nothing but an Axis of Eradication, and it‚Äôs about time we start calling out the bullshit."

Please keep it something that is reasonable. How would you think things would have changed?  I will provide a few examples 

1. The British would have picked a moderate to be the mufti of Jerusalem.  The British had several choices. A moderate might have allowed Jews and Muslims to work together. 

2. Napoleon stops after conquering Israel and supports a Jew state. Not sure of the outcome 

3. Yassir Arafat never leads the PLO. Jordan stays out of the six day war. Jordan makes peace with Israel. Gaza goes back to Jordan. 

4. Israel high command believed the women watching Hamas movements. They secretly call up two reserve divisions and place them in the Gaza envelope. They also move the music festival. Hamas launches their surprise attack. Israel is surprised by the size, but their two divisions completely surprise Hamas. There are dozens dead in Israel, but Hamas is sent packing. 

5. Rabin not assassinated?

6. Egypt never starts the blockade of Israel in 1967?

7. Lebanon does not allow the PLO to attack Israel?

8. UNRWA never formed? The UN just treated Palestinians equal to other refugees?

There is very little prospect of that happening today, but I wonder if there was ever a realistic chance. Avoiding occupation and letting the Egyptians, Jordanians and Palestinians deal with each other sounds far preferable to being an occupying power.

Alternatively, what if after 1967 Israel just withdrew instead of occupying the land? Like just built a barrier, stopped Palestinians coming into Israel (including for the day to work) and left them alone? Israel would still pursue terrorists but otherwise remain separate - no settlements, no checkpoints, no permanent presence of any kid. "

But at the same time, the people of palestine, both gaza and west bank, suffer. Most of them are innocent, they just want to live in peace, they have been victims of crimes of every type and suffer every day, even children.


Then, I recognize that many people in israel do not want the war, they have no hate against palestinians and just want peace (and in the case of some, ti have their kidnapped loved ones back), in many cases they dislike the government, and many have been protesting and even getting arrested. I dont think it is possible to erase the state of israel, were will those people go? We can expell them or worse. So 2 states solution is inevitable in my opinion.

But, i am completely against netanyahu, he is esponsable for the crimes in palestine, he's a criminal and a quasi-fascist, his party is inspired by revisionist zionism, that is a type of zionism inspired by fascism. 

I support the recognition of both nations, i support the people of both countries (if they dont adhere to the respective foundamentalist ideologies), but I am against hamas and against netanyahu and his government.

Once it started being noticed by the international community, it was quickly taken down by JP. But, [nothing can be truly erased from the internet](https://web.archive.org/web/20240926233315/https://www.jpost.com/judaism/article-821680) 

  
Here are some quotes from the piece:

""The recent conflict in¬†[Lebanon](https://web.archive.org/web/20240926233315/https://www.jpost.com/tags/lebanon)¬†raises the age-old question regarding the northern borders of biblical Eretz Yisrael. Where exactly did Hashem define the boundaries, and are we obligated to conquer those areas? Do the¬†[mitzvot](https://web.archive.org/web/20240926233315/https://www.jpost.com/tags/mitzvah)¬†of terumah and ma‚Äôaser apply to those lands as part of Eretz Yisrael, or are they considered outside the borders?

The Torah provides clear guidelines regarding the areas we were commanded to conquer when taking possession of the land...

When Hashem promised Avraham Avinu the Land of Israel at the Brit Bein HaBetarim, the pasuk says (◊ë◊®◊ê◊©◊ô◊™ ◊ò◊ñ): ""On that day, Hashem made a covenant with Avram, saying: To your descendants, I have given this land‚Äîfrom the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates.""

**At the blessing at the end of Parshat Ekev, Hashem tells us that we are granted every land we will conquer within the borders mentioned.** In the north, the Torah states: ""Every place where the sole of your foot will tread shall be yours‚Äîfrom the wilderness and¬†**the Lebanon,**¬†from the river‚Äîthe Euphrates River‚Äîuntil the western sea shall be your boundary."" This promise from the Creator clearly places the land of Lebanon within the Promised Land of Israel, or what some refer to as ""the Complete Land of Israel"", or ‚ÄúThe greater Israel‚Äù...

The Ramban wrote that Lebanon is within the borders of Israel and adds that we were obligated and commanded to conquer it.""


Edit to say: I don‚Äôt post this with any agenda other than because I want to hear the diversity of everybody‚Äôs thoughts on it ‚Äî y‚Äôall are smart and I am not. If I‚Äôve learned anything this year is that I don‚Äôt know shit. "

>We cannot demand a ceasefire unless we convince Hezbollah to separate Lebanon from Gaza,

In the usual framework of calls for unity of the lebanese, the party, belonging to a coalition, which defeated Hezbollah in the last election weaved in demands for the group, which essentially would force it to give up it¬¥s stranglehold on the lebanese state. ""We need to build a genuine state based on new foundations.""

[This follows a recent meeting of various factions, demanding an end of the fighting - and the full enactment of resolution 1701.](https://en.kataeb.org/articles/gemayel-meets-with-democratic-gathering-mps-says-lebanon-cannot-return-to-pre-october-7-status-quo) If enforced, this would mean a disarmament of Hezbollah, the end of it¬¥s ""state within a state"" and return as a political party like any other. 

>""...after everything that has happened, the situation cannot revert to how it was before October 7. It is unacceptable for anyone to drag the country into a war...""

Obviously this is as of now, just another one of many calls upon Hezbollah to stop desintegrating Lebanon and there can be little doubt, the iranian foreign minister will do everything in his power to quell any challenge to Tehran¬¥s death grip on lebanese politics during his visit. And yet, there is a glimmer of hope, that this time it may be different. The upper echelon of Hezbollah has been removed. It¬¥s ability to project force on it¬¥s political opponents is subdued and it¬¥s power base in the south is on the move to Syria.

Never before has Hezbollah been this close to being utterly and completely defeated. 

It¬¥s rivals in Lebanon offer to help it escape with some dignity, if stops, what is essentially a siege on the lebanese state. This little country has been to hell and back and to hell again. And after all, the question remains: Is there still hope for Lebanon? And if so, is there still hope for peace in the middle east? Somewhere under all that ash?

And finally: If the hope of Hamas to be somehow saved by Hezbollah is quelled, how likely are the terrorists to finally see reality and stop the war, they started on Obtober 7th?

1fvy0m7,"Pro-Palestine Voices Freely Admitted ""The Palestinian People"" Committed 10/7",2024-10-04 12:32:39,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fvy0m7/propalestine_voices_freely_admitted_the/,"Let us all remember, with the one year anniversary of the October 7th massacre of over a thousand Israelis rapidly approaching, that on 10/7 itself, pro-Palestinian individuals and groups spoke out to declare that ""the Palestinian people"" committed the 10/7 attack. Not Hamas, ""the Palestinian people"" were the ones responsible for that crime against humanity.

Students for Justice in Palestine, by far the largest and most popular pro-Palestine group in the United States, released a statement that, [""Today, we witness a historic win for the Palestinian resistance: across land, air, and sea, **our people** have broken down the artificial barriers of the Zionist entity""](https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2023/10/DAY-OF-RESISTANCE-TOOLKIT.pdf). 

Ali Abunimah, head of Electronic Intifada, [wrote in a now deleted tweet](https://x.com/aliabunimah/status/1710730561184989640?s=46&t=DUIdQ1oKjv5fgzpGa-dyIw), ""Palestinians in Palestine and around the world are elated that their resistance broke out of the ghetto and humiliated the enemy oppressor.""

170 faculty at Columbia University [published an open letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cVLg6RTnqd2BTzuouWbfACnFEex7GQeImDZJnMlUReM/preview) that described 10/7 as""a military response **by a people** who had endured crushing and unrelenting state violence from an occupying power over many years""

Speaking of Columbia faculty, Joseph Massad, prominent pro-Palestinian academic at Columbia, [wrote that](https://electronicintifada.net/content/just-another-battle-or-palestinian-war-liberation/38661) the attack was committed by "" an innovative Palestinian resistance"" and that, ""The sight of the Palestinian resistance fighters storming Israeli checkpoints separating Gaza from Israel was astounding, not only to the Israelis but especially to the Palestinian and Arab peoples who came out across the region to march **in support of the Palestinians in their battle against their cruel colonizers.**""

The UK Socialist Workers Party [posted that,](https://socialistworker.co.uk/international/why-palestinians-are-right-to-resist-israel/) ""**The Palestinians** have every right to respond in any way they choose to the violence that the Israeli state metes out to them every day. Victory to the Resistance.""

[The director of CAIR](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/08/us/politics/white-house-cair-nihad-awad.html), the most prominent and well known Muslim lobbying group in the US, said that he  ‚Äúwas happy to see Palestinians break out of Gaza on Oct. 7"" and that ""Palestinians in Gaza ‚Äúhave the right to self-defense.‚Äù

A pro-Palestinian student group at the University of Michigan [posted that](https://x.com/YDSAUMich/status/1710760815442235690/photo/1), ""Palestinians in Gaza are fighting back"", ""Palestinians have broken free of their cage,"" and that, ""This is **the response of a people** pushed beyond endurace.""

Internally, the rhetoric hasn't changed much in the past year, even after the horrifying details of exactly what happened on 10/7 has become public knowledge. [Here's just one example](https://x.com/i/status/1835126285825188257), a speaker for the Palestinian Youth Movement at MIT said that, ‚ÄúWe stand here nearly one year since **our people in Gaza** ignited the flame of resistance"" and ""**Gaza is leading the resistance,** not only in Palestine, but in the region and around the world.‚Äù

So now, at almost exactly one year since the genocidal attack now called 10/7, don't let anyone gaslight you and try to police your speech and tell you that 10/7 was done by Hamas and Hamas alone. [VP Kamala Harris said](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/12/02/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-on-the-conflict-between-israel-and-hamas/) that ""We cannot conflate Hamas with the Palestinian people,"" but we can and in fact we should. Because it's actually pro-Palestinians who do that conflation, not pro-Israel people, and they are proud of it. The Palestinian people and their supporters freely and unabashedly take credit for 10/7. Their spokespeople happily state, multiple times, that 10/7 was an act by ""the Palestinian people"". Not Hamas. ""The Palestinian people"".

So if pro-Palestinian groups can say that, so can everyone else. The Palestinian people committed 10/7. That's what SJP said. That's what Ali Abunimah said. That's what Joseph Massad said. That's what 170+ faculty at Columbia said. So you can say that too. Don't let them shout you down or try to gaslight you into believing otherwise. All you're doing is repeating what they themselves said."

Is that even a possible solution?



For example, it is currently getting close to 1 month away from the US presidential election.¬† Is there enough time for people who are against the continued conflict in the middle east to let the Harris/Walz campaign know / or let the Biden presidency know that they will not go to the polls on Election Day unless arrangements and statements are publicly made regarding the US stance of financially and militarily supporting Israel‚Äôs war. ¬†



I am not sure of the logistics of how the idea would get around.¬† Maybe if the idea went viral? Or what the outcome would be. ¬†



Of course, Democratic voters would not want to split the vote, basically handing the election to Trump.¬† But, at this time, is there enough leverage to get more progressive on this issue? ¬†



Personally, I feel Kalama Harris is an inspirational figure, and as an American, I feel so grateful to have a viable candidate to vote for.¬† However, it just seems to me that this issue is not being addressed enough and don‚Äôt want to miss a possible opportunity to try to get peace on the table. ¬† Ok thanks!"

1fvrf7s,Why does the Israeli government continue to fund the expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank?,2024-10-04 04:55:25,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fvrf7s/why_does_the_israeli_government_continue_to_fund/,"Assuming the ultimate goal of the Israeli government is peace with their neighbours, why do they continue to expand settlements in the West Bank?

There are 132 settlements in the West Bank which are considered legal under Israeli law, and 196 outposts which are not considered legal, although some have been legalised after the fact. None of these settlements are considered legal under international law. 

The settler population in the occupied West Bank has ballooned from 100,000 in the 90s to over 490,000 today.

The settlements are a point of contention in the international community. 

Israel's critics see them as a land grab and a way to slowly expand Israel's territory beyond the 1967 borders (which the international community generally uses as a starting point for a hypothetical Palestinian state) and shrink the territory which can be claimed by Palestine once a 2 state solution is eventually reached.

Defenders of the settlements mainly use arguments against the idea that they aren't allowed to build settlements E.g.

- The settlements aren't illegal
- The settlements are not an obstacle to peace
- The settlements do not violate the Geneva convention 
- The Palestinians are not using the land

I don't want to argue these points, since they have been argued for decades by people with better qualifications than me.

My question is how does the Israeli government justify the continued expansion settlements in the West Bank to an international audience who sees them as antagonistic and provocative? Wouldn't it be better to stop expansion until a two state solution is reached to dispel the allegations that Israel is doing a colonialism?

1fvkx3v,"New Al Jazeera Documentary called ""Investigating war crimes in Gaza"" Watch all the way through then let's discuss!",2024-10-03 23:05:55,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fvkx3v/new_al_jazeera_documentary_called_investigating/,"Regardless of what side of this you fall on would like to hear your thoughts on the new doc uploaded 10/3. I think Al Jazeera took much of the feedback about being biased and not showing sources from israelis or the israeli side and filled the doc full of footage directly from the social media and official videos from IDF soldiers and citizens.

Which speaking to pro israel/anti palestine folks much of what i hear when they acknowledge any civilian atrocities are ""Human Shields"", ""Bad Apples in IDF/Civilian Society"", and ""but 10/7"".

This doc shows i think clear evidence/concrete/objective of the IDF using Palestinians as human shields, the systemic/widely accepted view/though process of especially young israelis, and we all know all this on both sides started wayyyyy before 10/7, showing the hypocrisy in insinuating it's ok to use certain people as such and not others.

Anywho thoughts? - also if you don't watch the whole thing i really don't wanna see you in the thread. thanks!

\_\_ tbh the below are just more thoughts cuz the character count police soo main request for this post is still above \^\^\^\^\^

Not gonna lie from the beginning I'm been staunchly pro-palestine and find most pro israel arguments colonial and genocidal in nature......... BUT I strongly do think that when 10/7 happened the leftist/liberal community was so quick to defend the reasons/historical context that may have led (NOT justify but \*contextualize\*) of hamas' actions, that empathy, mourning, and consideration for the victims and continued victims of that day was very much lost. Two wrongs don't justify anything no matter from when or who you count the wrongs from. Context is important. It helps us understand, sympathize, and move forward from the actions of bad actors without repeating history.

Similarly, acknowledging why this is even an issue to begin with much of colonization and persecution of palestinians and their land begins by Israel from the same happening throughout so much of history the jewish people is also important. This is a deadly trauma response - and instead of it being targeted at the groups that are largely responsible for it (europeans), palestinians are (and now yemenis, syrians, lebanese, and more). Again not that whoever got targeted would ""deserve it"" but you have to admit the karmic revenge is a bit concentrated and misplaced.

Rogue side note: i've always found the human shield argument so wild. like sure if hamas is using civilians as human shield then like maybe come up with a smarter way to get to them? aren't yall supposed to be the smarted, most technically capable, most moral military in the world????? where's the covert mission? where are the special ops?  why is this so blunt? personally i think it's because the goal was ethnic cleansing from the get-go but i digress."

Is it to force the LAF to pick sides? I don‚Äôt know if the LAF would even want to fight in this options are civil war or being smashed by Israel, fighting Hezbollah definitely seems the better choice from my perspective i frankly doesn‚Äôt know too much about Lebanon though

Why not just bomb Hezbollah or attack them?? Does Beirut have any significant ties to Hezbollah I don‚Äôt know about?

I understand the bombing of Gaza (to an extent) as does anyone who speaks to people who have served in certain conflicts or researched the difficulties of fighting in a built up urban environment like Gaza however I don‚Äôt understand why they would want to make a ground invasion into Beirut. 
I also cannot see how bombing the Lebanese capital is appropriate retaliation against a group that (again to my understanding) stays in mountains or deserts(mainly seeing them in Hezbollah videos online living underground or fighting in the desert)"

These stories are presenting a girl who expressed empathy/concern for children starving in Gaza as being suspended for her own protection and harassed by her fellow students.   
  
Is there important context missing, is the presentation of facts accurate, is the reporting biased? 

Obviously the atrocities of Oct 7th and the lack of remorse or solidarity are going to breed hatred and reduce sympathy for innocent Palestinians. I would expect to see plenty of Israeli's expressing feelings of akin to 'why should I care about those people when I have my own security to worry about' or 'why tf would I have capacity for empathy when my mother raped, tortured, and murdered'.  I would like to get an accurate sense of this though. I suspect that the reporting i've seen related to this is being somewhat biased.

Nasarallah made a short trip to the HQ to discuss the terms of the ceasefire and that's when Israel killed him. Do you think such means of deception are appropriate? According to rules of war, this is a war crime. While Israel never cared about war crimes, this particular type of war crime would make Israel a 0 trustworthy negotiator. In this case, Israel has to continue occupation permanently because they cannot do diplomacy.

Also doesn't it perpetuate the antisemitic trope that Jews are  deceptive and liar and can never be trusted?

I believe the main goals of the war are to return the hostages and protect the Israeli citizens in the future from an attack similar to 7 Oct.

The one with the hostages is relatively clear. But regarding avoiding future attacks, it seems quite clear to me that the war is only increasing international hate against Israel and increasing support towards Hamas and Hezbolla, which would potentially increase attacks against the country. I‚Äôm quite ignorant in politics, and still I could foresee this on day one of the war. 

I‚Äôm really curious about the Israeli point of view. Do they really think they are eliminating terrorism/extremism and protecting the country from further attacks? Or is peace officially off the table now?

1fv6483,Reports: Yazidi woman sold to Hamas by ISIS freed by Israel,2024-10-03 12:07:04,215,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fv6483/reports_yazidi_woman_sold_to_hamas_by_isis_freed/,"Published footage on X along with source links: https://x.com/DavidSaranga/status/1841684995301097932?s=19

> Fawzia, a Yazidi girl kidnapped by ISIS from Iraq and brought to Gaza at just 11 years old, has finally been rescued by the Israeli security forces. For years, she was held captive by a Palestinian Hamas-ISIS member. She has now been reunited with her family.

Interestingly, in Syria, in Feb 2024, a similar development: https://m.jpost.com/middle-east/isis-threat/article-785553

> During a counterinsurgency operation, Kurdish fighters with the US-aligned Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) reported rescuing a Yazidi woman on Monday who had been held captive by the Islamic State terrorist group for more than a decade.

First, I have seen many attempts on social media and other channels to differentiate Hamas and ISIS by anti-Zionists, as opposed to link them together by pro-Zionist. This shows they may have at least some ""ideologies"" aligned. Imagine what an 11-year old girl could be sold for.

(Edit: correction, SDF refers to Syrian, not Lebanese Democratic forces)

Update: jpost reports she had 2 children after being sold to her ""husband"", who died sometime on their way back to Gaza: https://m.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-817572

Second SDF are reported as US allies, anti-Syrian-nationalism and would make sense for them to use the opportunity creased in Lebanon with the weakening of Assad-allied Hizbullah, to make a change towards diminishing Iran's influence."

1fv1zbz,A breakdown of Palestinian death. What percentage of civilian casualties were actually due to Hamas using them as civilian shield?,2024-10-03 07:07:07,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fv1zbz/a_breakdown_of_palestinian_death_what_percentage/,"I have family in some parts of the world that might be in danger if the war persist so I'm trying to research and figure out wether I should get them to move or not.
I want to know how much does Israel try to prevent civilian casualties and whether they actually care or not.
I'll update the post with the information I've gathered so you could correct me if I'm wrong or give added context.

These are the information I'm looking for:
- What are the most reputable, reliable and first hand sources concerning the conflict and direct links to their sites
- How many Palestinians have been killed and how many have been injured directly due to war? How many are estimated not to have been recorded due to complications like their bodies still being under ruble?
- What percentage of them were civilians and militants?
- What percentage of the civilian portion were actually killed because Hamas used them as civilian shields?
- What percentageof the civilian kills were due to unintentional collateral damage? For instance the ballistic missile and bombardment's error coefficient causing some to deviate from their intended trajectory enough to strike an unintended target that led to casualty.
- How likely are collateral civilian casualties based on distance from military bases? What distance is considered safe?
- Are the remaining casualty due to IDF negligence? Are there any sources where it proves that in at least some instances the IDF didn't care about or consider civilians and it caused avoidable and needles deaths?
- What are the casualty and injury count inderectly caused by war like starvation, famine, exposure-related death, death by curable diseases due to lack of healthcare...?
- Since it's war, some civilian casualty is unfortunately expected but I want to get a feel for how much is unavoidably necessary
- What portion of the population have been displaced from their homes?

These are the facts that I've gathered thus far:
- There were 41,431 Palestinian killed as of 23 September 2024. On 17 September 2024, the GHM published the names, gender and birth date of 34,344 individual Palestinians whose identities were confirmed. This reflects more than 80% of the casualties reported so far; of these, 60% were not men of fighting age. The GHM count does not include those who have died from ""preventable disease, malnutrition and other consequences of the war"" and they unfortunately don't distinguish between militants and civilians.

Based on [this](https://apnews.com/article/gaza-death-toll-hamas-war-israel-40000-32a79e03c8eb62669412dab23d03219e#) article, ""The Israeli military claims that over 17,000 Hamas fighters are among those killed in Gaza but has not provided evidence."" But it didn't cite any sources. As some have pointed out we can't really assume that the Hamas military only consists of men of fighting age and I can't just take what the IDF states as fact too, even if we assume the article is true; but both of them result  in 60% of Palestinian direct war casualties being civilians."
1fv1ayc,I‚Äôd like to raise an interesting thought about anti-Israel protests and rising Jew-harassment.,2024-10-03 06:16:36,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fv1ayc/id_like_to_raise_an_interesting_thought_about/,"I‚Äôd like to raise an interesting thought about anti-Israel protests and rising Jew-harassment.

Hey everyone, I‚Äôm an Israeli Jew living abroad for work. Over the years, I‚Äôve noticed a rising sense of discomfort and fear among Jewish communities around the world. Whether people believe it or not, many Jews feel a constant sense of threat. We often think twice before wearing visible Jewish symbols like a Star of David or a kippah in public, and we avoid being near anti-Israel protests or rallies.

From what I've observed, this environment of rising hostility doesn‚Äôt just impact daily life but also seems to reinforce Zionism as an ideology. The irony here, at least from my perspective, is that all the hatred directed toward Jews and Zionism (and there are clear statistics on this) only makes the idea of Zionism more entrenched for many. When Jews feel unsafe or unwelcome, it reinforces the belief that Israel is the only place where they can truly feel secure, which makes Zionism a stronger ideology for some.

For instance, there are many studies, like those from the ADL (Anti-Defamation League), that show rising incidents of antisemitic attacks in various parts of the world. The combination of these incidents and hostile anti-Israel rhetoric leaves many Jews feeling isolated, which in turn pushes them to believe more deeply in the necessity of a Jewish state.

So, I find this almost paradoxical. The more the world pushes against Zionism, the more it strengthens the need for it in the eyes of many Jews. Have you noticed this trend? Do you think this kind of backlash unintentionally strengthens Zionism, or do you think there‚Äôs another explanation? Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences, especially if you‚Äôve seen a similar phenomenon where you live.



To simplify my theory: Hating on Zionism is largely contributing to it. "
1fuz8sn,"Who should I support, Israel or Palestine?",2024-10-03 04:01:07,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fuz8sn/who_should_i_support_israel_or_palestine/,"Hello! So since you read the title above, I want to get straight to the point, my Dad is Jewish, his family are descendants from Russian Jews which migrated to the west after the Russian Revolution of 1917, my mom in the other hand, is a Dominican (Dominican Republic) She is a Christian and wildly supports Israel. 

I am just gonna say this out of my own heart and opinion, I love Israel, with all my heart, I would die for them, for the freedoms and liberties of the Israeli people (not the government, it's a disgrace, well kinda. Anyway, I have heard some people state that Israel was built from racism, even though I love Israel, I do believe that this is, well.. kinda true, even though Palestine never existed before Israel's founding, and the Palestinian people weren't really, well, called or referred to that particular nam, it has come to my conclusion that Israel had the right of way, but I do not support the fact that Israel occupied/took over the lives of these Arabs and made them miserable.

I have heard of Nakba, which pretty sure was the marching of thousands of Arabs being expelled from the newly formed Jewish state, which, in my oppinion is racist and it is just wrong in general. It's like letting random strangers come into your house because you're kind but then you get kicked out because they feel like they need a home but you don't. I don't know it is just my opinion correct me if I am wrong.

Another thing I want to point out is the genocide part, I think, in general, Pro-Palestinian supporters over exaggerate genocide, the definition of genocide is intentionally killing or wiping out a specific group, race, or population from an area. Israel is not intentionally killing Palestinians, in fact, they are trying their best to avoid it, I mean, in my opinion, how hard would it be if your enemies were hidden among the local population, and their bases of operations were on the most populous areas, it will be practically impossible for them to take a hit, which is something Israel has been trying to do, but has been miserably failing.

Next, I want to point out that Israel is a first world country, compared to most Arab nations surrounding it, Gaza doesn't even have a legitimate government, plus, even if you call Hamas a government, your just naive. I am going to say some things, I see that Israeli soldiers have been doing ""inappropriate"" things to Arab woman, which is of course, in the human level, just terrifyingly horrible and inhumane. But in the other hand, you have to look at the bigger picture, whatever those soldiers are doing to those Arab women, Hamas is doing it 10 times worse to the Israeli ones. Which is extremely horrifying and horrific to go through and must be stopped, both of them, Israeli and Hamas soldiers, immideatly. 

Furthermore, I just don't see the point in supporting one side, I mean, I understand, but in another way, I don't. Israel has the right to exist, just as the Arab people have the right to self-determination and freedom. Both people have done really bad things in the past, but it doesn't mean that they have to be mean and horrific to each other. It's just not sufficient and ideal for both peoples to keep fighting each other. I don't see the point anymore, they have been doing this for 75 years straight, and they are just not stopping.

(I am so sorry that I am typing so much, I just have so much that I want share and words just make it hard to state it, just one more thing.)

Last thing, my parents are pro-Israel supporters and there is no changing their minds evevn if you try. I feel like supporting Israel and its people. I actually want to live in Israel, but I don't think right now it's a good time to be supporting anything, specially the way this war is turning out. I feel like I should be neutral, but I don't know what to do. I have so much more to discuss, but I will end it here for now, I do not want to wait your precious time! 

Thank you so much for reading and taking your time to think about what I have discussed! Please share what you have! I really want to know your opinions! (Please keep it civilized!) And one thing, what do you envision for the Middle East to look like by 2050? Thanks! (There Might be spelling errors, sorry! :)"

My partner (in which I won‚Äôt let on where each side sit on the conflict) and best friend have extreme views on both sides of the conflict. They both have their reasons, being their upbringing and general views of the world. I‚Äôm accepting of that. 

I‚Äôve taken the stance to stay quiet and listen to each other‚Äôs views, I have opinions for both sides of the conflict. They‚Äôve both been vocal on social media. 
This has lead my friend and partner unfollowing each other on Instagram. I think that for the most part, probably the best thing to do as it‚Äôll only be fueling each others opinions. 

I‚Äôve stayed quiet not really engaging in any conversation around the topic with my friend and perhaps it‚Äôs put a wedge in my friendship, as the content they are posting is very heavy and they live in another country to me right now, which has added distance to our friendship. It‚Äôs been roughly 9months since we spoke. 

They are both very important people in my lives and I‚Äôve tried to not let this interfere, by keeping a neutral ground. However, my partner is my partner, and I will stand by them through thick and thin. They support me through all the ups and downs through life and is a genuinely great person for me. I couldn‚Äôt fault them as a person and we have a child together. 
I have now noticed my friend has unfriended me on social media. I have reached out wanting to understand why they have done this, and their response was it‚Äôs no coincidence that we have conflicting views based on my silence. I don‚Äôt want to lose this friend but what can I do? I can‚Äôt tell either of them what their views should be. I have tried so hard to stay out of this but it‚Äôs really backfired. 

. This isn‚Äôt about who‚Äôs right and wrong in the conflict. This is about navigating a varied set of views. "

Reports are saying that[ 180 ballistic missiles](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-822801) were fired into Israel yesterday, leading to everyone in Israel to take shelter. Iran previously attacked with [170 drones, 30 cruise missiles, and 120 ballistic missiles in April. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1c4q0zy/implications_of_the_iran_attack/)You can read more details about the attack at the [Institute of the Study of War](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024), and this current attack is claimed to be in response to killing Nasrallah and Haniyeh.

Here's my thinking:

Iran is a nuclear threshold country, and letting Iran attack like this is unsustainable. Just like the calculus towards deterring Hamas and Hezbollah has changed, the calculus towards the IRGC should change as well.

However, Israel should be careful to not spread its forces too thin. They have now opened another theater in Southern Lebanon, and I assume they are wrapping things up in Gaza. If Israel decides to create another theater in Iran, than it could also have adverse economic implications for Israel when they have to prolong their war economy.

[ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1c4q0zy/implications_of_the_iran_attack/)Capability wise, Israel would come out on top. In addition to Haniyeh, groups like [Predatory Sparrow have successfully initiated massive cyberattacks](https://www.wired.com/story/predatory-sparrow-cyberattack-timeline/) against Iran. Moreover, we are seeing that Iran's rockets are closer in technological capacity to Hamas and Hezbollah weapons - they explode in mid-air without anti-ballistics, and they are hardly precise. Iranian rockets are simply fired in the direction of Israel in the hope that they will hit something.

Just like Hezbollah, I'm sure that there is more propaganda surrounding Iran that makes them out to be ""turban Napoleons"" more than they are. Iran has not really demonstrated that they are being careful in calculating their tactical decisions, they seem to be operating more in damage control mode to make up for their intelligence failures.

Edit: Several users have pointed out that preemptive would mean that Israel would have struck before Iran launched their ballistic missiles. These users are right. 

The original debate question was in the context of asking American political candidates what their stance is on Israel's next steps. Israel was just attacked by Iran again. How should Israel respond, and would you support or oppose an attack on Iran given the current situation?"

Translation:

""Captain Eitan Olster, 22 years old. A fighter in the Egoz Unit, the Commando Formation.""

""May his memory be blessed.""

This is what was written over post of the recently killed IDF special forces soldier, Eitan Olster. A soldier of the Egoz Unit, an Israeli special forces unit.

Israeli online sources (although the IDF hasn't) report Captain Eitan Olster, from the 'Egoz Unit' of the IDF's 89th Brigade has been killed in Souther Lebanon. Mind you, The 'Egoz Unit' is specialized in anti-guerilla warfare, special reconaissance, direct action and¬†**was created to fight Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon.**

This comes after Hezbollah reports ambushing two IDF ground forces invading Oddaisseh and Maroun Al-Ras (the same place where Egoz lost 8 men killed in a 2006 ambush, 18 years ago), 400 meters from the Lebanese-Israeli border and claimed to have inflicted casualties among the IDF unit.

Videos have been posted online on Telegram of IDF helicopters evacuating the wounded from Oddaisseh and Israeli sources report around 20 casualties (don't know killed or wounded) in Oddaisseh while 8-15 casualties were reported in Maroun Al-Ras, with the number of deaths and wounded still unknown.

Online statements by Hezbollah regarding the IDF incursion into South Lebanon

1. In support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in support of their valiant and honorable resistance, and in defense of Lebanon and its people, the fighters of the Islamic Resistance, at dawn on 2-10-2024,¬†**confronted an enemy ""israeli"" infantry force that attempted to infiltrate the town of Odaisseh from the direction of Khallet Al-Mahafer**, clashing with it, inflicting casualties, and forcing it to retreat.
2. In support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in support of their valiant and honorable resistance, and in defense of Lebanon and its people, the fighters of the Islamic Resistance¬†**engaged in clashes with ‚Äúisraeli‚Äù enemy soldiers who infiltrated the town of Maroun Al-Ras**¬†from the eastern side, inflicting several casualties among their ranks, and the clashes are still ongoing.

This is the first confirmed Hezbollah announcement (or announcements) about fighting IDF troops in South Lebanon despite the IDF already officially announcing entering South Lebanon a few days prior and destroying several Hezbollah underground tunnels along Lebanese border villages. It seems that while these border villages were abandoned by Hezbollah guerillas (perhaps due to the difficulty of defending them and proximity to Israeli artillery fire over the border), both Oddaisseh and Maroun Al-Ras village seem to be the first line of defense against an Israeli attack. I'm guessing the location of both of these villages, being a bit far from the border (around 400 meters), and the larger urban area make it a more suitable place for Hezbollah's first responders to make their stand.

This was mirrored in 2006, when the IDF was allowed to advance into Lebanese territory but then came under ambushes and heavy fire from Hezbollah guerillas, entrenched in Lebanese villages. The same village, Maroun Al-Ras was the battleground between IDF and Hezbollah guerillas in the 2006 war, which led to the deaths of 8 members of the Egoz Special Forces Unit and an indecisive costly battle for the IDF.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle\_of\_Maroun\_al-Ras#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Maroun_al-Ras#)

My opinion: What's weird is the IDF still hasn't announced the death of Eitan Olster despite Israeli and Hebrew sources online announcing it and mourning over the loss of an IDF soldier. They usually are the first to announce a soldier's death whether it be a high-ranking commander or a lowly sergeant. Seems the IDF has changed their procedures.

Amir Tsarfati's (Israeli Christian Evangelist) online Telegram has already rushed to post about his death and even has already posted a video about his last words despite the IDF still being silent over this. While most news are slow to publish about this, a few have reported on the incident (although they neglect to announce the death in the Egoz Unit)

[https://news.sky.com/story/israel-iran-latest-idf-sends-more-troops-into-lebanon-israel-to-launch-significant-iran-retaliation-in-days-12978800](https://news.sky.com/story/israel-iran-latest-idf-sends-more-troops-into-lebanon-israel-to-launch-significant-iran-retaliation-in-days-12978800)

[https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/hezbollah-reports-1st-direct-clash-with-israeli-ground-forces-in-southern-lebanon/3348544](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/hezbollah-reports-1st-direct-clash-with-israeli-ground-forces-in-southern-lebanon/3348544)

As of now, only 1 confirmed IDF soldier was killed in South Lebanon despite Hezbollah and Israeli sources reporting a ""security incident"" in the North and ""multiple casualties"" (it could mean dead or wounded). I expect the IDF to make a statement regarding his death sometime later today. The answer is probably in the middle. One or two IDF soldiers were killed while a lot more were injured in the Hezbollah ambushes.

EDIT: Online sources report another IDF soldier from the Egoz Unit, **Daniel Azzam** has been claimed to have been killed in Southern Lebanon in the same incident. So scrap the title of my post. I'll post his photo in my other post.

Note, this hasn't been confirmed yet and still the IDF hasn't announced it nor have I seen any memory posters online regarding him. I'm not sure if that's his real name. Probably it will take some time for an Israeli news outlet to announce a ""May his memory be a blessing"" poster.

SECOND EDIT: The IDF officially announces Eitan's death. His full name and rank being Captain Eitan Itzhak Oster, a squad commander in the Egoz Unit, Commando Brigade. No word on the second IDF deceased Egoz trooper.


THIRD EDIT: A third death has been announced online. Some online groups report 10 deaths (highly unlikely) but still seems to be a serious incident. No confirmation from the IDF as of now. I think I'll stop updating for now."
1fubxb7,Genuine question: how are people pro Israel now?,2024-10-02 09:13:51,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fubxb7/genuine_question_how_are_people_pro_israel_now/,"Please before you get started on some tirade about how I‚Äôm antisemitic, want Israel wiped off the map, or am pro Hamas, just genuinely hear me out. I am specifically talking about the conflict in more recent years, not historically and I don‚Äôt want some BS about ‚Äúright to land‚Äù claims or religious claims because that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm asking. And for the record, I have just taken a module in my university on the conflict from a notoriously Zionist institution BECAUSE i want to know more about this perspective, so I‚Äôm not making this post to just insult pro Israel people.

When you see the number of genuine, undebatable warcrimes Israel is committing, as well as a strong argument that there is a genocide occurring in Gaza from an international law standpoint, how can you still support what Israel is doing? Hell, let‚Äôs even just look at the pager/walkie talkie operation against Hezbollah recently. You CANNOT make an argument that the operation was not a warcrime. Israel had no way of knowing who would be in the vicinity of those pagers when they exploded, and it is a fact that there were some civilians harmed in the process. 

And now Israel are invading LEBANON, showing that this has never been about ‚Äúeliminating hamas‚Äù, it‚Äôs been about expanding territory in the Middle East and eliminating neighbouring opposition. Let me make one thing clear, what Hamas did on October 7th was horrendous and a tragedy, but HOW ON EARTH DO PEOPLE SEE THAT AND THINK THAT ISRAEL IS JUSTIFIED IN BOMBING HOSPITALS, KILLING JOURNALISTS, and overall just using the Geneva convention as a checklist just because they had some super secret intel that there was a single hamas operative in that bombed building of civilians.

As an Irish person I have to say, the pro-Israel view seems to come a lot from people who have never experienced true oppression and invasion at the hands of a more equipped power. How many US supported operations in the middle east will it take for us to realise that the US and their interference almost always ends in innocent lives being taken. Iraq, Afghanistan, and now Palestine/Lebanon. I genuinely have to believe that some people see this conflict as being less horrendous because it‚Äôs just the Middle East. If a conflict of this scale was happening in the West, people would be considerably more defensive about the killing of innocents. 

So please, I beg, without giving me some strawman argument about who owns the land, who started the conflict, or anything like that. How can you look at Israel‚Äôs operations over the last year and still stand on that side of history. I genuinely want to know and am open to hearing other perspectives on this.

EDIT: Apolgies, my language was a little iffy at one point. I should have been more clear that I don‚Äôt think that Israel is definitely committing genocide, just that I personally think there‚Äôs a fairly strong argument. And also, regarding the pagers, I understand that they have not been charged with warcrimes as of yet. Do I think Israel will be taken to international court after this conflict? Yes, but I should have acknowledged that everything is very muddled at the moment regarding facts and I should‚Äôve been more clear in my language, thanks for the feedback üôèüôè

FINAL EDIT: Thanks everyone for your thoughts and input, as I had hoped from this post I got some really interesting stuff and resources to look into from the other side of my ideology for this conflict! Yes I made some sweeping statements in this post, but I decided to do so to get a reaction and really see people‚Äôs true opinions on the issue. I haven‚Äôt responded to every comment because DAMN i annoyed a lot of people but thank you all for your respective inputs. Some of you were really civil and helpful in spite of disagreeing with me which I really appreciated. As for the rest of you who chose to insinuate that I was some antisemite or tried to belittle or insult me, I hope that some day you can mature to a point where you can acknowledge that someone is trying to learn and actually have a discussion rather than digging your heels into the sand and throwing a temper tantrum. I can‚Äôt wait to look into this issue further with the information I‚Äôve received from some of you going forward, so thanks again!"
1fu7hd0,Community feedback/metapost for October 2024,2024-10-02 03:57:11,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fu7hd0/community_feedbackmetapost_for_october_2024/,"**Changes to Posting Requirements**

Yesterday I posted a short [PSA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ft26ux/psa_changes_to_account_requirements/) regarding changes to posting requirements in light of a recent wave of ban evasions and today I would like to expand on what caused us to ultimately make these changes and what the changes were.

In the past month or so, we noticed a marked increase of accounts engaging in ban evasion the majority of which we believe originated from one specific user.

https://preview.redd.it/rkf6awxdf9sd1.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d79df12a66d7342b41a177a12f2b2b7ba6a7e00

16 days ago one of our users submitted a [metapost asking for karma requirements to deter the usage of troll/throwaway accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fhsgly/can_we_get_a_minimum_karma_requirement_to_post/) (Because there is some confusion about this point, we **did not** add a karma requirement to post or comment). The thread was immediately flooded with troll/throwaway accounts which were promptly banned and eventually suspended by Reddit.

https://preview.redd.it/mpakmk25g9sd1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=45f46e8234d085d5d961b7abe47e865230f941a7

At this point we were dealing with so many cases of ban evasions and violations in general that we decided to update our automod to help mitigate the situation.

While I won't detail the exact changes that have been made to posting restrictions due to [OPSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security), throwaway/troll accounts should now have more difficulty interfering with our subreddit while genuine accounts will largely remain unaffected.

As the automod is not perfect, and will inevitably catch legitimate accounts in the filter, we can (after review) manually approve users upon request in modmail.

**Changes to Short Question Posts**

After reviewing a [recent community poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fexil9/community_poll_have_changes_to_our_post/) asking for feedback regarding changes to short question requirements, we found that the majority of users wanted more restrictions on said posts. As such, we have implemented a 250 character requirement to short questions which should hopefully increase the quality of discussion and add some nuance to otherwise simple or low effort posts.

Additionally, warnings have been added to automod messages to prevent users from attempting to pad their posts with spammy text in order to bypass the character requirements. Attempts to bypass the filter may result in a warning or ban (per our [moderation policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/wiki/mods_index/moderation_policy/)) as they will be counted as Rule 10 violations.

https://preview.redd.it/wn7415flm9sd1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=472787a0a95a0425872133fc04aa6dfc537be6d0

**October 7th and its Effect on the Sub**

We are now a few days away from the first anniversary of the October 7th massacre so I felt it would be a good time to look back on how much our subreddit has changed since then. Following the massacre, the number of subscribers and participants on the subreddit skyrocketed nearly resulting in us placing it into restricted mode.

https://preview.redd.it/isnqksxaj9sd1.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=a82e5d8d26e09159dcb088fd395b53ef2b0c93ce

With the help of some new mods and better automation we somehow managed to keep the mod queue under control and the subreddit open as we felt that facilitating discussion (even if it did not meet the quality standards that we had before) was preferable to shutting down. Since then the activity levels on the sub have normalized significantly despite still being somewhat higher than they were prior to the war.

For more details, you can refer to the June metapost [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1d74914/community_feedbackmetapost_for_june_2024/).

As for other data that we have acquired in the past year, you can find it below:

**Summing Things Up**

As usual, if you have something you wish the mod team and the community to be on the lookout for, or if you want to point out a specific case where you think you've been mismoderated, this is where you can speak your mind without violating the rules. If you have questions or comments about our moderation policy, suggestions to improve the sub, or just talk about the community in general you can post that here as well.

Please remember to keep feedback civil and constructive, only rule 7 is being waived, moderation in general is not."
1fu4cou,Is hamas also the reason why palestinians are dying? Educate me pls.,2024-10-02 01:08:54,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fu4cou/is_hamas_also_the_reason_why_palestinians_are/,"(i think this was asked here many times but i still wanna ask. Feel free to educate me.) is hamas also the reason why people in gaza are suffering? I don't mean it in a way like israel is bombing gaza because of hamas, that's obvious, but for example i saw that hamas was not letting Palestinian people evacuate. (https://youtu.be/fMV9HAEK-5A?si=-ZLZXFGDn7n-C0rM i don't know if what the person is talking about is actually what's happening in the video) 
And i feel like they are using their people as living shields.(I know that term is kinda uverused by now)

I support Palestine but not hamas. I saw both palestinian, and Israeli people that feel this way. i know that this conflict has been going on for way longer so saying its one or another side's fault isnt prolly the case, but still. 

Also I don't understand why and how does it spread so much antisemitism. Why can't people just understand that being jewish is not the reason of bombing gaza? For example russia has a hustory that's much worse, and there isnt that many people that hate all rusians. Why do people tend to hate jews? i thought world is done with this. 
As a person that had jews in his family, this is really uncomfortable and scary for me, and my whole family. 

I wanted to ask if this is a valid opinion and wanted so see it from different perspectives of different people.

(Off topic to fill the character limit)
I'm a 14yo kid so I don't know too much about this conflict. I just wanna know what's happening in the world, cuz people my age dont really give a shit. Here in czechia its pretty one sided for example on the news, where they talk about this mostly as ""israel is good, palestine is bad"" wich I don't really think is the case. I know this post was really simply written and there is much more to it. I'm speaking from what i read, saw or heard. Please correct me if needed."

I saw news in my country saying that Israel was lacking in military personnel yet they open new frontier.

Why is Israel invading a neutral country? I know hezbollah is a military-political organization that dont like israel, but i feel like attacking a neutral country will only help military organization gain more say in lebanon. 

I hope that conflict in any place of the world can end peacefully, through talks and negotiations. "
1fu3db0,What are the possibilities of a strike on Iran by Israel ,2024-10-02 00:19:49,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fu3db0/what_are_the_possibilities_of_a_strike_on_iran_by/,"What could be considered a soft target for an Israeli response 

Been weighing this up, 
1) Iranian civilian targets (power plants, refineries) I think this is a no, after Netanyahus speech appealing to the civilian population. 

2) Military barracks,  again I think no, Iranian footsoliders aren't going to be involved in any kind of land war against Israel.

3) Reactors and plutonium enrichment plants, this is a maybe for me. If Irans missiles were targeted at Israeli nuclear stockpiles , then there is a possibility of justification. 
Military airfields, not much of an airforce  in Iran to attack.

4) Drone processing plants/ballistic missile processing plants and stockpiles,  these are a strong yes for me.

5) For personnel,  the ayatollah is too high profile for me, but Mahmoud Ahmadinejad head of secret intelligence is a yes.

It maybe that airstrikes or missile launch isn't necessary,  the targets may already be compromised like Ismail Haniyeh.

But is Israeli retaliation worth it? Irans seems only to go for direct strikes when a high ranking official is assassinated.  There aren't many high ranking officials left in hezbollah or hamas. 


Since October 7 , damage that hezbollah and hamas can inflict on the Israeli population and military is minimal. As it progresses hamas and hezbollah will grow weaker militarily, they can't recruit from within with haste, this could lead to further infiltration from Israeli intelligence. 

I've seen a few tiktok videos claiming hezbollah has some kind of battle hardened special force waiting for the invasion into Lebanon. I don't believe there is any such force, and if their was it doesn't have satellites, airforce or weaponry capable to take on the idf. 

If hezbollah wants to survive,  it has to figure out a way to stop a land invasion into their territory.  "
1fu0ju7,The right of return is not realistic or consistent with a two state solution,2024-10-01 22:07:50,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fu0ju7/the_right_of_return_is_not_realistic_or/,"Looking back at the [Camp David Summit](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/background-and-overview-of-2000-camp-david-summit) and the [Ehud Olmert's Peace plan](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ehud-olmert-s-peace-offer) one of the biggest obstacles to negotiations that Palestinians were uncompromising on was the unrestricted right of return. Realistically, moving back over 5 million palestinian refugees would not be possible given the size of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. There simply wouldn't be enough land available for 5 million more people, I mean Israel's entire population at the time was 7 million.

There were attempts to overcome this such as proposals to allow refugees the right to return in Israel proper but the palestinians requested 150,000 every year. Israel is right to be concerned that demographically this would lead to the state changing from a jewish state to a multinational state.

I acknowledge the counter arguments regarding justice but a right of return would mean the end of Israel and palestinians know this. It's not worth giving up on peace because of this. I mean look at the current crisis which could have been wholly avoided especially in Gaza.

I know that the incompetent and corrupt PA leaders were also one of the main reasons talks failed."

EVERY. Single. Time. We come back stronger.

Fast forward just 45 years after the Holocaust‚Äînow we took back our homeland and have nuclear weapons to protect us. 

From the ashes of being burnt, gassed and murdered, we rose up, and not just to survive, but to thrive. Israel is the living proof that we will always survive. We stand tall as a testament to resilience and faith.

Many Arab states have tried to wipe Israel off the map for years. They united their forces, mounted attacks in waves, and tried so many times to annihilate us for many many years. 

And EVERY time They always end up with less than they started. Their dream of destruction turns into their loss. Including less territory. 1948, 1956, 1967, 1967-1970, 1973, 1982, 1987-1993, 2000, 2006, 2008-2009, 2012, 2014, 2021, and now Oct 7th, 2023. Again, they come to destroy, and again, they will fail.

They can kill us, bomb us, murder us, r*pe us‚Äîbut we don't just survive, we grow stronger, wiser, and fight harder every single time. History has proven it, over and over again. And the attackers? They end up with less EVERY TIME. You think we‚Äôre going anywhere? Watch. We stand strong, and our strength multiplies when we're attacked.

The Jewish people are eternal. No matter how many times our enemies try to erase us, we remain. We innovate, we contribute, we build. We don‚Äôt seek vengeance, but we will always defend our people and our land with every fiber of our being. To the world, we bring advancements in technology, medicine, and art. Our contributions are endless, and they‚Äôll keep coming because we‚Äôre not going anywhere.

I wish nothing but peace and prosperity to the Persian and Iranian people. They are the true inheritors of an ancient and beautiful culture. The bonds between the Jewish and Persian people stretch back millennia, and we have nothing but respect for their rich history. 

However, to the fanatics of the Iranian revolutionary government, YOU WILL perish! To those Islamic radicals and weather leftists who push violence, terror, and fanaticism‚Äîthis will be your end. You will fall as all those who sought to destroy us have fallen before.

This is not just about survival‚Äîthis is about thriving in the face of adversity, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve always done. 

We are resilient, strong and determined. 
We fight, we rebuild, we repair, and we stand strong.

How could they honestly think after the horrific events of October 7th the world would still be on their side? None of their wars have had any success whatsoever in weakening Israel or shrinking its territory. 

Do they believe Allah will protect them and lead them to victory ? Israel and the US are two of the strongest military powers in the world. Do they just wish to turn themselves and their population into martyrs? Even from a PR perspective Hamas‚Äô plan has largely failed since no nation has imposed economic sanctions on Israel so far and the genocide accusations are obviously false. If you‚Äôre planing to exterminate a group you don‚Äôt warn them before military strikes and vaccinate their children for Polio. 

A war with Iran or a broader regional war would be disastrous for the Iranian regime and lead to so many more deaths. I hope eventually peace and stability can return to the region. The US military seems to be relatively uninvolved in the current conflict and have not said they will assist Israel push Hezbollah out of southern Lebanon. Is this because there‚Äôs an election coming up or do they naively believe it‚Äôs possible to make peace with an internationally recognized terrorist group like Hezbollah?

1ftqd4h,Do you think that IDF actions in Gaza respected the principle of proportionality?,2024-10-01 15:06:53,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ftqd4h/do_you_think_that_idf_actions_in_gaza_respected/,"**Background**

International Humanitarian Law (IHL), also known as *jus in bello*, is the law that regulates the conduct of war [\[1\]](https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/document/file_list/what-is-ihl-factsheet.pdf). It is a branch of international law that seeks to limit the effects of armed conflict by protecting persons who are not participating in hostilities and by restricting and regulating the means and methods of warfare available to¬†combatants [\[1\]](https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/document/file_list/what-is-ihl-factsheet.pdf). A major part of international humanitarian law is contained in the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 [\[1\]](https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/document/file_list/what-is-ihl-factsheet.pdf). Israel signed the Geneva Conventions in 1949, and ratified them in 1951 [\[2\]](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/gciii-1949/state-parties/IL). IHL prohibits all means and methods of warfare which cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering [\[1\]](https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/document/file_list/what-is-ihl-factsheet.pdf).

The *right of self-defence*, which is one of the only two cases where the use of force is legally allowed (the other being a mandate from the UN Security Council), is regulated by Article 51 of the UN Charter [\[3\]](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/full-text). The International Court of Justice (ICJ) established two minimum requirements for the right of self-defence to be lawfully exercised: the *principle of necessity* and the *principle of proportionality*. The principle of proportionality is also a fundamental principle of IHL [\[4\]](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/proportionality-international-humanitarian-law-principle-rule/), [\[5\]](https://casebook.icrc.org/a_to_z/glossary/proportionality).

**The Principle of Proportionality**

The principle of proportionality revolves around the balance between incidental loss of civilian life vs. the anticipated military advantage gained by the attack [\[ref, pag. 59\]](https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/ils/vol92/iss1/3/). An attack is *disproportionate* if the loss of civilian life is *excessive* with respect to the anticipated military advantage.

[Rule 1](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/customary-ihl/v1/rule1) of IHL states that:

>The parties to the conflict must at all times distinguish between civilians and combatants. **Attacks may only be directed against combatants. Attacks must not be directed against civilians**

Thus, an attack is unlawful if it is not specifically targeted at combatants. Moreover, an attack directed against combatants may have incidental civilian casualties (collateral) and, if such collateral is deemed ""excessive"" (with respect to the anticipated military advantage), then the attack is unlawful.

***First Punch***: Let ""Alice"" and ""Bob"" be two placeholders for two States. If Alice ""throws the first punch"" at Bob (i.e. Alice attacks first), then this is a *necessary but not sufficient condition* for Bob to claim that his reactions are legally justified by self-defence. The principle of proportionality still applies, and, if not respected, Bob's use of the right of self-defence as justification legally decays.

**Israel-Hamas war (2023-ongoing)**

Having given some background on the principle of proportionality in international laws, now comes the main question. To the best of my knowledge, there is still no definitive judgement from the UN (including its institutions, like ICJ) regarding the evaluation of proportionality for the actions committed by IDF in Gaza. The accusation of having committed *genocide* to Israel, by South Africa, is also still pending final evaluation.

**List of Acronyms**

**UN**: United Nations  
**ICJ**: International Court of Justice  
**IDF**: Israel Defense Forces  
**IHL**: International Humanitarian Law

Thus, the poll question is:

*Given the available evidence, do you think that IDF actions in Gaza (in the time period: 2023-2024) have respected the IHL principle of proportionality?*

[US official says Iran preparing to 'imminently' attack Israel with ballistic missiles | The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/us-official-says-iran-preparing-to-imminently-attack-israel-with-ballistic-missiles/)

*Iran is planning to attack Israel ‚Äúimminently‚Äù with ballistic missiles, an anonymous senior White House official tells Israeli and US media.*

*The official says that ‚Äúwe are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack. A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran.‚Äù*

Then carried afterwards by the BBC, Al Jazeera, everywhere...

Looks as if Iran may now intervene directly in the face of the assumption, they would do nothing. Apparently maybe they actually do have ""red lines"". And perhaps after Nasrallah, in the face of becoming the laughing  stock of the Arab world in the face of claiming to be the big force of resistance against the ""Zionist entity/regime"".

Question is whether this looks serious this time, or whether its a comparative slap on the wrist strikes earlier this year. Israel will strike back for sure, and then there's the question of what the US forces in the region do.

Meanwhile in Lebanon, the IDF apparently has announced any incursion will be limited and short, lasting days, not weeks. This morning was a joke with headlines claiming an invasion of Lebanon that never was... And apparently that isn't the news of the day....

Imminent apparently, with BBC turning its footage to Tel Aviv, as if everyone is waiting for something big to happen.

Is this the big moment where this set of proxy wars turns into a hot region-wide war? Which countries and sides get involved?

Is this the moment where the Iran nuclear crisis gets resolved?

The world holds its breath.

1ftmdt5,Where does this all end and what should happen after the war?,2024-10-01 12:03:07,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ftmdt5/where_does_this_all_end_and_what_should_happen/,"Israel started it's ground invasion of southern Lebanon today which was inevitable after Hisbollah joined the war against Israel on 8/10/2023. There seem to be a lot of parallels to 1982 when Israel tried to dislodge the PLO.
I'm aware how old this conflict is and how much ideology plays a role, as well as religious fanatisism. I just wonder what could Israel and the international community do differently this time around? Even if the IDF occupies all of Gaza and kicks out Hammas and Hisbollah, they have to leave at some point.

People tend to forget that Israel left Gaza in 2006 and to their own devices and look how this turns out. Who says it will be different this time? I think it's out of the question that Hisbollah and Hammas need to be removed, especially about the latter I'm very sceptical. I just wanted to ask this sub, how do you see all this turning out and what should be done after Hammas and Hisbollah are somewhat defeated? I assume something like a UN peace keeping mission is out of the question but Israel can't and shouldn't have to deal with this on their own. 

As somebody said, as long as the people in Gaza prefer dying as a martyr fighting Israel over trying to live in peace there will never be any. Sure Israel has some fault in that but mind you, Hammas was elected in 2006 which shows the true face of many palestinians. And instead of using the energy and the aid to built a good life they put everything they have into destroying Israel, really sad. 
And Lebanon is a failed state where a terror organisation has created a state within a state. So this isn't an attack on Lebanon but Hisbollah. You can't complain when you are unable to keep control of your country and let a terror organisation attack Israel and they respond and try to get rid of that threat."
1ftiqk4,Opposing war in Lebanon because I doubt the Israeli government's intentions,2024-10-01 07:55:02,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ftiqk4/opposing_war_in_lebanon_because_i_doubt_the/,"Edit: I should clarify: I do not oppose *any* military action in Lebanon. I specifically oppose the war I believe Netanyahu will lead.

This is my take on the current events in Lebanon and I invite you to share your opinions on this with me:

As it stands, I oppose an Israeli ground offensive into Lebanon.

Now, before you start calling me a terrorist sympathizer or something like that: I wholeheartedly oppose Hezbollah just as I oppose Hamas. I would even support military actions against them if those meant that these organisations could be dismantled in a way that would lead to lasting peace (I do have opinions regarding the civilian death toll such wars would or have entailed, but I do not want to derail all this by diving into that.)

However, I do not believe Netanyahu's government has any such intentions. We know how Bibi propped up Hamas to undermine the PLO. We know how Smotrich Said, Hamas was an asset and the PLO a burden, as Hamas delegitimizes Palestinians as a whole. We know that right wing extremist parties need an external enemy to thrive and we know that Netanyahu specifically needs an external threat so he does not have to deal with his internal political mess.

I see (or at least hope) that the general Israeli population simply wants to live in peace. And if creating peace or simply protecting its citizens was the genuine goal of Israel's military endeavors, I would not be principally opposed to them. However it's not the Israeli population directing this war but it's government. And this government does not thrive on ending conflicts but on continuing them.

I will now be asked whether I think, Israel should just lie down and take Hezbollah's rockets then. No, it should not. I'm not adressing ""Israel"" with this. You cannot demand something from a country as an abstract. All I'm asking for is for Israelis to question whether if they agree with their government's actions they also agree with its intentions and to vote or protest accordingly if they (as I presume they do) are more interested in Israelis living in Peace than in Arabs dying."
1ftg1y9,"if Al-Aqsa Mosque magically disappeared tomorrow, most Israeli Jews would oppose building a Third Temple",2024-10-01 04:48:38,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ftg1y9/if_alaqsa_mosque_magically_disappeared_tomorrow/,"What is the one word you **never** hear in American college protests for Palestine, but **always** in speeches by actual Palestinians?

The West tries to erase the religious elements of this conflict, but if you listen to actual Hamas speeches, that word is always mentioned.

""They're coming for Al-Aqsa""  
""They're violating the sanctity of Al-Aqsa""

""They're going to destroy Al-Aqsa""

  
Most Israeli Jews couldn't care less about Al-Aqsa. Most Israeli Jews have zero interest in resuming the animal sacrifices of the 1st century.

Most Israeli Jews would love to have a synagogue on Temple Mount for praying - but there's already plenty of room to build one! There is an empty space on Temple Mount to the east of Al-Aqsa large enough to build a synagogue the size of the Pantheon.

In Alt Neuland, the foundational text of Zionism, Herzl envisions a Third Temple - but not on top on the Foundation Stone, and without the priestly rites of 2,000 years ago. In other words, simply an exceptional and holy synagogue.

  
If Al-Aqsa Mosque magically ascended into the sky tomorrow, and the Clerics of the Waqf ruled that this was the will of God and it would not be rebuilt - most Israeli Jews would oppose the restoration of 2nd Temple Judaism and all its rituals.

Secular Jews have no interest in a priestly caste performing animal sacrifices. Ultra-Orthodox Jews, already skeptical of the Israeli state, believe that the Third Temple will only be built in the Messianic Age, and will oppose any human attempts to build it today.

Only a fraction of Religious Nationalists would support its rebuilding. These voices - people like Smotrich - are a small, but very vocal and publicized minority of Israel's populace and politics.

  
If Al-Aqsa magically disappeared and the Muslim world greenlit all Jewish construction on Temple Mount, likely less than 15/120 members of the Knesset would vote for a Third Temple. The overwhelming majority - including Netanyahu and his Ultra-Orthodox allies - would vote against it.

So unless you feel threatened by the mere coexistence of Jewish and Islamic prayer in their mutual holy site, this is a manufactroversy. Not only do Israelis not want to destroy Al-Aqsa for their Third Temple, most don't want a Third Temple in the first place."

1ft67s5,"""Israel sterilizing Ethiopian Jewish refugees"" and the Depo-Provera affair",2024-09-30 20:49:16,135,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ft67s5/israel_sterilizing_ethiopian_jewish_refugees_and/,"These claims are resurfacing on Reddit, so I thought it'd be useful to share some context. The story concerns approximately 50'000 Ethiopian Jews, also known as 'Beta Israel', who immigrated to Israel between 1975 and 1991, during the Ethiopian Civil War. Most of them passed through refugee camps set up in Sudan or Ethiopia, which were not run by Israel, although the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) provided material support. In these camps, hundreds of Ethiopian Jewish females were administered Depo-Provera, an injectable contraceptive that lasts about 12 weeks. Its use by itself is not controversial, as it is part of the [standard](https://data.unhcr.org/en/documents/download/111089) [toolkit](https://www.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/legacy-pdf/3bc6ed6fa.pdf) supplied by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) worldwide, particularly in areas with high sexual violence and infant mortality. It is also one of the most [popular](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/49283/1/ep11043.pdf) forms of birth control in Sub-Saharan Africa, due to its low cost and relative safety.

After the refugees arrived to Israel, Israeli doctors reviewed their medical records, asked if they wanted to continue with the injections and gave them another. However, in 2012, Israeli journalist Gal Gabai [discovered](https://www.timesofisrael.com/ethiopian-women-claim-israel-forced-them-to-use-birth-control-before-letting-them-immigrate/) that some women did not understand that Depo-Provera prevents pregnancy and its potential side effects. While much of it was due to language barriers, it is also possible that some women in refugee camps were brow-beaten into taking the contraceptive. Several women were told that they had to receive the shots if they wanted to immigrate to Israel. In one covert recording, a nurse was heard saying that the shot is given ""primarily to Ethiopian women because they forget, they don't understand, and it's hard to explain to them."" Additional evidence includes a letter sent by the Israeli government to the Director of the JDC Medical Programs in Ethiopia praising his work, noting that 30% of his patients use a form of birth control compared with 5% of Ethiopians.

This revelation triggered a scandal, followed by an investigation by the Israeli State Controller. A 2013 [official report](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2016-01-20/ty-article/.premium/comptroller-ethiopians-not-forced-into-birth-control/0000017f-dc79-df62-a9ff-dcffb5e80000?lts=1699374726092) found no evidence that the shots were administered ""under pressure or threats, over or covert,"" but recommended that the doctors refrain from giving the injections unless they were absolutely certain that the patients were giving informed consent. Tebeka, the Ethiopian legal aid group that took the story to court, [agreed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/ethiopian-birth-control-revelations-ignite-debate/) that Israel did not have a deliberate policy to reduce birth rate among Ethiopian women specifically, but noted that ""underlying racist sentiment allowed the matter to perpetuate unchecked.""

Today, the number of Ethiopian Jews in Israel more than [doubled](https://manaramagazine.org/2022/03/the-status-of-ethiopian-jews-in-israel/) to 160'000. Their fertility rate [dropped](https://www.timesofisrael.com/ethiopian-birth-control-revelations-ignite-debate/) from 4.6 children per woman in 1996 to 2.5 in 2011. It remains unclear whether the Depo-Provera affair contributed to the decrease, but a [2016 study](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26554851) in the *International Journal of Ethiopian Studies* conclued that ""the rapid decline in fertility rates among Ethiopian Israeli women following their migration to Israel was not the result of the administration of [Depo-Provera], but rather the product of urbanization, improved educational opportunities, a later age of marriage and commencement of childbirth and an earlier age of cessation of childbearing."""

According to eye witnesses and reports from her family, her car was stopped by masked Hamas gunmen from three cars who sprayed the vehicle with dozens of bullets. Local journalists and residents say she was murdered for refusing to hand over aid donations, said to be medical aid, to Hamas.

Her family issued a statement in Palestinian media on the 28^(th) saying they were told by Hamas representatives at the hospital where her body was taken that she was killed in a case of mistaken identity, that her death was an ‚Äúaccident‚Äù, and that they gave no further details. Her killers, whose identity was not disclosed, had failed to identify the vehicle she was driving.

HEAL Palestine issued a statement saying that Hijazy was ‚Äútragically killed‚Äù carefully not mentioning who did the killing, as if a thunderbolt came out of the sky and landed on this young mother of two children.

How often does Hamas shoot people in Gaza?

The illegal expansion of Israeli-controlled land in the West Bank is one of the more convincing justifications given for extreme actions taken by Palestinians to free themselves. Most Israelis do not support settler terror in the West Bank. Bar seems to believe it has reached a crisis point. Has the public taken notice?

I am doubtful that this administration will train, prepare, and direct the IDF to reverse expanding Jewish terror in the West Bank, as we know some don't even see it as a problem. But I would love to hear that I am wrong and that they are doing anything like that, even just in reaction to the worst manifestations of the problem. What's needed long-term in any case is some pro-active policy to address the roots of resources and thinking that lead to this kind of ugly behavior.

Assuming the current administration will not address this, are there any politicians or parties in Israel who have a chance of coming to power and reining it in? What might they do? Some of the people and funding sources are well known, are they breaking existing laws or would new laws be required? Is there anything related to education in Israel which has contributed to this development, and in any case is there anything which could make it unacceptable in future generations?

What are other countries (especially the USA, where many extremists come from) doing and what else could they be doing? What are international bodies and NGOs doing and what else could they be doing?"

(https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1bw8dp8/why_israel_cant_stop_the_war_from_an_israeli)





I disagree with you on all points.¬†

‚ÄòQ1: Life in the Middle East was great before Zionists came and stole the land.‚Äô

Q2: Jews were banished from European countries. You should be thankful for the Ottoman Empire. Instead, you took the land to yourselves after the British left their mandate.

A1-A2: Yes it was, it was much safer. To start off there were always Jews as well as Christians, living peacefully in the Middle East, the Mizrahi Jews living in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and Levant Christian‚Äôs. They all had one thing in common, they were Arab‚Äôs: culturally, in Language and in Identity. Things that they shared with Arab Muslims, peacefully.¬†

When they Jews were banished from Spain, forced out of Italy facing forced conversions, The Ottoman Empire ¬†therefore became the refuge, from 1452to mid 20th century they lived in peace. No requirement needed to study in universities, whereas in Europe everywhere ¬†you go they were being harassed by anti-Semitic laws and stereotypes.¬†

Jews enjoyed a significant degree of autonomy and were governed by their own communal leaders under the Millie system which allowed them to manage their own affairs in matters of religion and personal status.

The ottomans also recognised the economic and intellectual value that Jewish communities bring so they allowed Jews skilled in trade, finance and craftsmanship to flourish contributing to the economic growth of major cities that their Jewish communities were concentrated in suchj as Constantinople, Thessaloniki and Izmir.

‚ÄúThe Arab students are lovely and gentile.‚Äù Is a dystopian way of writing, if they speak out they‚Äôll get suspended or labelled a terrorist, or even dare I may say it, ‚ÄòShot‚Äô since they allow student reservist it carry a full of rifle I to campus & into lectures. I‚Äôm sure when given these circumstances an Arab will just nod along to everything you say.¬†


Q3: Israel asks for merely a temporary ceasefire deal. After they get their hostages, Gaza will be bombed again.

A3: Israel does not care about the Hostages, there's no hostages in Lebanon and look they‚Äôre bombing them.

Israel does not want a ceasefire. Even if all those requirements were to be met, even if Hamas all came skipping, singing into Israel‚Äôs custody, the war would not end.¬†

The word ‚ÄòCeasefire‚Äô means nothing to them. They will keep on going until one of the western countries forces them to stop. That‚Äôs how it has been for every war that Israel has had.¬†

Egypt ‚Äî Israel/British/French ‚Äî 1956:

Israel only stopped once the US president threatened direct and painful retribution.

Egypt/Syria ‚Äî Israel ‚Äî 1973:¬†

Israel stopped because the Nixon‚Äôs US Refused for them to continue.


Israel has never ended a war without being told to do so. ¬†They need to be told to stop, not just to end the war, but to keep Israelis believing that the IDF have a way to fix Israel‚Äôs problems.¬†

As we are seeing now, No one is stopping Israel and as times go on, The IDF have no clue what they are doing‚Ä¶ like they weren‚Äôt supposed to get this far‚Ä¶¬†

And so their aims will become more and more outrageous, just to test their western allies‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a political statement and once they are forced to stop. The Israeli government can then blame, the US/UK, for stoping them from reaching their outrageous aims. That would somehow fix Israel‚Äôs problems.¬†


Q4(a): Just because Hamas doesn‚Äôt make the right decisions, doesn‚Äôt excuse the IDF‚Äôs absurd brutality and genocidal actions.

A4a:

That‚Äôs a really weird comparison you‚Äôve plucked out there. A. Your trying to justify the Tameness of the IOF by giving an example of Brits killing 2million Na*zi and because it‚Äôs the Na*zi (bad guys) it makes it fine. You‚Äôre also trying to align the IOF with the Brits, where one side is right and the other is wrong.¬†

It makes no sense to use that comparison when there‚Äôs completely different context, historical circumstances and the nature of the conflicts.¬†
The Brits along with the allies were fighting a global war. The IOF on the other hand is fighting an asymmetrical war.¬†

How about comparing the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the situation in Gaza. There‚Äôs a lot of similarities there, The imbalance of power and the desperate nature of resistance. In both cases you have a much stronger military force‚Äî the Nazi*s in Warsaw and the IDF in Gaza ‚Äî Fighting against groups that are vastly outmatched.
The Jewish fighters in the Warsaw Ghetto, like Hamas in Gaza, saw themselves as standing up to what they felt were oppressive or occupying forces.¬†
Both conflicts happened in densely packed urban areas, 400,000 Jews in Warsaw, and 2 million Palestinians in Gaza. Meaning that civilians were always caught in the crossfire.
The Warsaw Ghetto fighters resisted the Naz*is‚Äô attempt to wipe them out entirely, just as Hamas in Gaza fight as resistance against the total blockade and overall Israeli occupation.¬†
And it‚Äôs playing out exactly the same way. Total annihilation.

Q4(b): Hamas is a resistance organization. They had the right to strike Israel on 10/7. Meanwhile, Israel, who occupies the West Bank, has no right to defend itself according to international laws.


A4b:

The IDF has been indiscriminately killing civilians, including children and women, and even specifically targeting them. There are reports of soldiers laughing about their kills and treating bombings as a kind of game, even dropping bombs on children playing outside. There‚Äôs video proof everywhere. The IDF is also arrest children and youths, interrogate them, take their photos, and traumatize them, only to release them later and delete the records. In some cases, the IDF commandeer homes, turning them into military bases while blindfolding and zip-tying entire families into small rooms where they are forced to soil themselves. Once the operation ends, the soldiers leave as if nothing happened. Throughout these operations, The IDF routinely terrorised and massacred Palestinians in ways that seem designed to breed fear and submission among the population.

If the IDF didn‚Äôt have statehood then, they‚Äôd definitely over qualify to be a terrorist organisation.¬†


Q4(c): Hamas took hostages to release their hostages from Israeli prison. Israel takes hostages too so Hamas‚Äôs actions are merely paybacks.

A4c:

Words matter, and the way we describe things can completely change how we understand them. Calling Israel‚Äôs detainees ‚Äúprisoners‚Äù hides the reality that many of them, especially the 5,000 Palestinians in administrative detention, are being held as hostages. These people haven‚Äôt been charged, haven‚Äôt had a trial, and their detention is based on nothing more than the assumption that they might do something wrong in the future. There‚Äôs no end date for this‚Äîit can go on forever, which makes it a huge issue under international law.

Think about the fact that children can be thrown into this system and face up to 20 years in prison for something as simple as throwing a rock. It shows just how brutal and unjust this system is. Locking up people, particularly minors, without giving them a chance to defend themselves is nothing short of state-sponsored hostage-taking. Israel might say it‚Äôs for security reasons, but this practice completely ignores justice and basic human rights, instead fueling a cycle of fear and oppression.¬†

I‚Äôd rather be taken hostage than be left as a prisoner, abused and forgotten, with no answers, no dates, just left to rot. At least when you‚Äôre a hostage, there‚Äôs usually a clear demand, something specific that your captors want. But being locked away in administrative detention, where you‚Äôre held indefinitely without charges, is a whole different kind of torment. It‚Äôs like being trapped in a never-ending limbo, where you‚Äôre left to wither away with no idea if or when you‚Äôll ever be free. It‚Äôs not just about being held‚Äîit‚Äôs about having your humanity stripped from you, leaving you to rot in a system designed to break you.

Q5: Netanyahu gave Hamas money in an attempt to strengthen it to keep it in control over Gaza. He wanted Hamas to strike to have an excuse to eliminate all of Gaza. Even Ehud Barak said so.

A5:¬†
Netanyahu gave money to Hamas to prevent the creation of a unified Palestinian state with the West Bank. It‚Äôs classic divide and conquer. By keeping the Palestinians split between Gaza and the West Bank, between Hamas and the PA, it makes even basic coordination nearly impossible. Just having a face-to-face meeting as Palestinians is a nightmare because they have to pass through Israeli checkpoints, travel miles apart, and cross more checkpoints just to sit in the same room.

This division makes it almost impossible to run a united Palestinian government. How can they even distribute funds or make decisions when they‚Äôre being deliberately kept apart? Netanyahu‚Äôs funding of Hamas isn‚Äôt about peace or keeping things quiet; it‚Äôs about fueling jealousy and competition between Gaza and the PA in the West Bank. By sowing discord between the two, he ensures they remain too fragmented to form a cohesive Palestinian state

1fsz3ig,Hamas and UNWRA both confirm Hamas leader killed in Lebanon Al Sharif was also UNWRA leader,2024-09-30 15:59:59,244,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fsz3ig/hamas_and_unwra_both_confirm_hamas_leader_killed/,"Fateh Al Sharif was chairman of the UNRWA teachers' association and had been the principal of the UNRWA-run Deir Yassin Secondary School in al-Bass. He was killed by Israel in an attack in Lebanon. Hamas published an official proclamation in which it announced that Fateh Al Sharif was (in secret) the commander of the Hamas movement in Lebanon and a member of the movement's international leadership.

Watchdog UN Watch had been pressuring UNRWA for months to fire Al-Sharif for the lesser charge of promoting terrorism, but despite copious evidence of overt support for terrorism UNRWA Commissioner Lazzarini had refused to do more than place him on leave.

People are quick to make use of the UN's imprimatur as an indication of trustworthiness and reliability, despite Israel and its supporters pointing out rampant bias, support for terrorism, and even participation. UNRWA's links to Hamas and extremism have gone underreported, ignored, and under-appreciated for far too long.

What‚Äôs more, this man was a principal and in a position of leadership amongst UNRWA teachers, and was also making posts glorifying terrorism. This should give pause to people who have long dismissed the allegations that UNRWA schools themselves are indoctrinating Palestinian children.

My opinion is that Israel should be able to defend itself from hostile external militant forces, but I no longer know whether or not Israel holds a significant moral high-ground. Though accidents do happen in war, and some amount of civilian casualty is inevitable and expected in most major armed conflicts, the unwarranted/targeted intentional killing of civilians is a clear breach of international law. Militant groups like Hamas and Hezbollah specialize in civilian camouflage, making it harder for the IDF to determine combatants from civilians in some cases. Some militant combatants disguise themselves as civilians to approach Israeli forces in relative safety before attacking with concealed small arms or explosives. This has made Israeli forces more trigger-happy and suspicious of Palestinian civilians. I genuinely believe that the Israeli government and high command does not want to harm civilians, but the sometimes rash decisions of field officers and junior commanders can determine whether or not a innocent civilian lives or dies."
1fsxbk5,What if?,2024-09-30 14:47:22,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fsxbk5/what_if/,"What if...

Palestine was a Christian-majority country?

Would the war still be going on?

My take on it:

Even if there was a war, it would have ended and people would have started to co-exist.

The real problem is ISLAM and some of its radical ideologies and stupid people who follow it blindly.

The only reason war is still going on is because if Israel tries to co-exist with Muslims, they'll start taking over, cleanse all Jews, and take everything over.

It's not simply about land or politics; it's about an unwavering belief in religious superiority and a refusal to share the land.

I don't see any other reason why the war is still going on.

If Palestine were a Christian-majority country, these ideologies wouldn't play such a significant role, and the path to peace would likely have been clearer.

I'm not saying that Christians won't hate Jews. They certainly won't take up weapons and try to kill a whole country.

They would have started to grow and compete with Israel, economically and scientifically.

Not sure if I'm right. What's your take on this?



---------------------



I'm truly confused seeing all the majority anti-Israeli propaganda.

What would you have done if someone came into your home, took your family members hostage and hid behind innocents?

Leave your family members to escape for themselves?

What will you do if there's someone who poses a constant threat day in and day out to you and your family members?

What will you do if there is a group of people who never leave you and your family members to live in peace and never try to make peace?

What will you do if there is a group of people whose only goal is to see you and your family die and disappear from the world?"
1fssl5r,"""Judaism is Dead"" - article by anti-Zionist Jew. Thoughts?",2024-09-30 10:48:45,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fssl5r/judaism_is_dead_article_by_antizionist_jew/,"https://archive.ph/ux5wt

He argues that:

Jews are not a nation, but just a religious community, as Jews speak different languages, haven't resided together in one place for several generations, have different cultures and don't share a history

The only reason why Zionism is so dominant among Jewry today is because of groups such as Anti-Defamation League, AIPAC, Hillel, Jewish National Fund and others

There were hardly any Jews in Palestine before Zionism (despite other parts of the Ottoman Empire like Thessaloniki and Constantinople being full of them), that the Jews who settled in the early Mandate era were just adventurers who left in masses during WW1 while the native population stayed, that the millions of Jews who emigrated from eastern Europe between 1918-22 much preferred places like the United States and hardly any of them moved to Palestine

The 60k German Jews who moved to Palestine in the 30s only did so out of pure necessity, didn't care about learning to speak Hebrew, and wanted to return to Germany immediately after the Nazis lost their power, that many of the displaced Jews sent to Palestine weren't even aware that the ships they stepped on were going to Palestine, and that between 1945 and -67, allegedly around 190k Jews emigrated from Palestine/Israel

Israel replaced dozens of independent Jewish cultures, languages, customs and their heritage with a single new artificial uniform Israeli mutt, and destroyed centuries of Jewish history in different countries. 

Israel was responsible for the rise of Jew hatred among MENA nations, and that if it weren't for Zionism, the Jews of Arab countries would be regarded as Arabs (as they always were) and live in harmony just like the Christians are deeply integrated in Arab nations. Arab Jews were more similar to Arab Muslims than Polish Jews

90% of the Soviet Jews who left after the collapse of the USSR who used Israeli visas to leave, dropped the Israeli visa and left to the US instead, and the ones who came were non-Zionists who just wanted to escape the economic horror of 90s eastern Europe

The only reason more Jews didn't emigrate from Israel after 1948 was because they were denied passports and exit permits, were forced to pay a debt for what the Israeli state gave them when they came, and launched a heavy propaganda campaign indoctrinating them with Zionist beliefs

Around 600k Israelis live outside of the country today according to the Israeli Bureau of Statistics, proving low loyalty among Jews to the Israeli nation

There are no ancient Hebrew artefacts or presentations in any of the major museums in the world, and that no vital ancient Jewish civilisation ever existed

Israel is responsible for people picturing all Jews as ""people with yarmulkes, living on hilltops, carrying Uzi guns, and wantonly shooting innocent Palestinians""

Is his narrative distorted, or is it accurate?"
1fsq2tw,Why do they fail to mention that Israel was bombed by Lebanon everyday for almost a year?,2024-09-30 07:39:27,353,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fsq2tw/why_do_they_fail_to_mention_that_israel_was/,"I've been seeing headlines from BBC, CNN, even Reuters, about Israeli strikes in Beirut, and in the articles themselves they're recounting every strike Israel took against Lebanon without mentioning once the fact that Israel has been bombed by Lebanon everyday from the start. 

80,000 people have been evacuated because of daily Lebanese rockets targeting civilian cities and towns. They've killed 21 soldiers, 23 civilians (12 of which are children), injured 172 (mixed civilians and military personnel).

I can understand the argument that Palestinians don't have a country, therefore no responsibility to anyone, but Lebanon is a country. Lebanon have seaports and airports, they aren't under seige - all the same things that Pro-Palestinians say if Palestinians had there'd be peace. 

If a country bombs the citizens of another country, isn't it justifiable to bomb them back? I don't get it.  "

This is perhaps to be expected as a large number of Israelis are Slavs from Russia, Poland or Ukraine. But that‚Äôs besides the point.

When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, all over social media you saw their supporters saying stuff like ‚Äúman I don‚Äôt know what to tell you, it‚Äôs like their opposition has crumbled. The Ukrainian army just doesn‚Äôt exist anymore.‚Äù

Yeah well look how that turned out. How Israel supporters talk about Lebanon the past few days is pretty much identical to this. Acting like they won the war, when they just entered head first into something much bigger than they expect.

If it was that easy to defeat Hezbollah, Israel would have done it in 2000 instead of being defeated and leaving Lebanon. They would have done it in 2006 instead of losing.  But what‚Äôs surely going to happen now is they‚Äôll wonder into Lebanon, spend a few years being unable to dislodge Hzb and facing thousands of casualties plus casualties in Gaza. 

In this conflict is the potential for Israel‚Äôs doom but that‚Äôs neither here nor there. The key point is, Israel has won a battle in this war. May I add, the first battle in this war it actually won. But the Germans won the battle of Warsaw or the Battle in the Ardennes. That did not mean they won the war."

Israel isn't green in this conflict, but (many) Palestinians are enabling and supporting the FAR AND AWAY worse offender, Hamas. 

I watch any debate with Medhi Hasan and he can't answer this question: what do you think is appropriate for Israel to have done? The 'debate' with Piers Morgan, and others, shows me someone who doesn't care about anything else other than Palestinians - even at the cost of Jews. And that's not correct. 

Hasan (and others who share his perspective) share a delusional world where, their only solution is 'ceasefire and stop the occupation'. The only concrete answer Hasan offers to what Israel should have done october 8th was ""stop occupying lands that aren't yours"".

This seems insane. 1300 of your citizens are targeted for murder and the solution is to give into their demands? Has giving in to terrorism ever worked in any situation?

Piers pushes back saying ""look ok, so indiscriminate bombings is bad. We can agree on that. So what do we want"" 

And Hasan replied back ""targeted attacks"". Which Piers pushes him on it saying ""you're calling the targeted pager attacks terrorism. The civilian to combatant ratio was record breaking in terms of least death to civilians, yet that wasn't good enoguh for Hasan. Worse - he called THAT a terrorist attack 

So my question to pro-palestinians  - what do you honestly expect the IDF to do? Do you genuinely believe negotiations with a terrorist group will bode well for long term safety and security of Jews? "
1fsfnkz,There are no moderate Palestinians,2024-09-29 21:46:07,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fsfnkz/there_are_no_moderate_palestinians/,"Let‚Äôs just cut through the nonsense: the idea that the Palestinians are ready for a state is pure fantasy. Mahmoud Abbas, the so-called ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA), recently sent condolences [\[1\]](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/hamas-offers-condolences-to-hezbollah-following-assassination-of-hassan-nasrallah-/3344525) to Hezbollah over the death of their leader, Hassan Nasrallah‚Äîa man who dedicated his life to Israel‚Äôs destruction. If this is the leader of the ""moderate"" faction, what does that say about the political climate in Palestinian leadership?¬†

This isn‚Äôt an isolated incident. The PA is constantly threatening to cut security cooperation with Israel [\[2\]](https://www.wsj.com/articles/israeli-raid-in-west-bank-leaves-nine-palestinians-dead-11674726236), a move that would only embolden extremists and further destabilize the region. How does a government that actively undermines its own security arrangements have any business running a state? You‚Äôd think that a leadership serious about statehood would focus on governance, infrastructure, and building relationships with its neighbors. Instead, we see the same tired rhetoric and anti-Israel hostility.¬†

Now, compare that to Israel. The textbooks in Israeli schools teach history, democracy, and coexistence [\[3\]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220272.2020.1716392). Meanwhile, Palestinian textbooks‚Äîyes, even in PA-controlled schools‚Äîare filled with glorified violence and martyrdom. [\[4\]](https://www.memri.org/reports/palestinian-authority-schoolbooks-2017-18-increased-indoctrination-jihad-and-martyrdom) You can‚Äôt build a functional, peaceful state on a foundation of hatred and radicalization. This isn‚Äôt a government preparing its people for peace; it‚Äôs one preparing them for eternal conflict.¬†

And let‚Äôs talk about who the Palestinians actually support. Salam Fayyad, who was one of the few Palestinian leaders to run on a platform of a real two-state solution (and even suggested allowing Jews to live in a future Palestinian state), got a whopping 2% of the vote. [\[5\]](https://ecfr.eu/special/mapping_palestinian_politics/legislative-elections-2006/) That‚Äôs the level of support for the most peace-oriented figure they had. The reality is, Fayyad‚Äôs vision of coexistence and state-building is the minority opinion. The overwhelming majority are backing factions like Hamas, whose charter still calls for the destruction of Israel. [\[6\]](https://pcpsr.org/en/node/980)

Honestly, if the Palestinians were given a state today, what would happen? It wouldn‚Äôt be a peaceful democracy‚Äîthey‚Äôve already proven that by electing Hamas to govern Gaza in 2006. The result would be another extremist, corrupt, and dysfunctional regime right on Israel‚Äôs border. It would be another Hezbollah-style theocracy armed to the teeth and dedicated to undermining Israel at every opportunity. Why would anyone in their right mind think that‚Äôs a good idea?¬†

I‚Äôm tired of hearing about ""peace talks."" The fact is, there‚Äôs no peace partner on the other side. Not now. Not for the foreseeable future. You can‚Äôt negotiate with people who refuse to even recognize your right to exist. The international community should stop pushing Israel to make concessions when the Palestinian leadership isn‚Äôt serious about peace.¬†

If the Palestinians want a state, they need to prove they‚Äôre capable of governing responsibly. But right now, they‚Äôre nowhere close. Until there‚Äôs real leadership, real reforms, and real preparation for peace, the idea of Palestinian statehood is nothing more than a dangerous fantasy.



TL;DR: outside of a small fringe group there are no Palestinians who want peace

They've embedded themselves so deeply into our institutions that it‚Äôs almost impossible to trace every single influence they've got their hands on. From the highest levels of academia to grassroots movements, they‚Äôre pulling strings we don‚Äôt even realize exist.

**WHY is the US letting them:**

* Infiltrate major U.S. colleges by funding Islamic Studies departments and throwing cash at radical left student groups. Not just at a few schools either‚Äîthis is happening across the country, from Ivy Leagues to local state schools, no institution is immune.
* Bankrolling left-wing organizations to stir up violent protests in major cities. These protests don‚Äôt just pop up out of nowhere; there‚Äôs a well-funded machine behind them, turning chaos into a weapon.
* Pouring money into social media and media designed to radicalize students on campus. From popular online publications to YouTube channels, they know exactly where to target young, impressionable minds.
* Backing leftist influencers by boosting their content on social media via their billions of bots, making sure the algorithms favor them. These influencers suddenly blow up out of nowhere, gaining followers by the millions. Once the algo favors them they get the exposure. ‚Äîit‚Äôs orchestrated.

* Buying up paid subscriptions with their millions of accounts to prop up and support radical left and far-right influencers alike. The narrative is controlled, and they are shaping it from both ends.

This has been happening since the '80s, and now it‚Äôs hitting a peak thanks to social media. 

You‚Äôve got kids justifying the actions of Bin Laden, Hamas, and mourning Hezbollah leaders even if they have never stepped a foot outside Ohio. They have no idea how manipulated they are.

There are Wikipedia editors (or content creators or whatever people who edit pages are called), who provide ""Zionist cleanup services"" for Wiki pages.

Notice how they distinguish this ""service"" from other content they are involved in, described on their profile page:

>We can also remove Pro-Zionist statements on Wikipedia, The Pro-Zionist editing lowers the credibility of Wikipedia and makes it less reliable. There are also other genocides and persecutions, displacements like the Gaza genocide, Uyghur Genocide \[...\] Darfur genocide, Nakba, that we need to make more people know about.

Note it's not about sharing anti-Zionist opinions along side pro-Zionist ones, but rather the explicit intent to remove pro-Zionist content that should raise an alarm. Also note the use of the ""we"" pronoun. It's a person who is part of a group that provides this ""service"". This particular user is also a member of the Wiki Palestine Project, according to their UserBoxes.

Since Oct7, the Zionism Wikipedia entry has been bombarded with edits, citing anti-Zionist sources, removal of others, [recruitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Zionism) of editors to make changes to the page and more. I've personally checked the Battle of Gaza 2007 page, which has a 17-year-span of edits, a third of which were made after October 7 2023 (that's how I found about the user above).

As far as Wikipedia is concerned, they have some neutrality rules in place (aka NPOV) which are supposed to protect the content, but given the fact there are people with permission to edit and a deliberate, institutionalized, organized intent to remove content, references, history, while inserting alternatives, I doubt Wikipedia moderators can keep up. Part of NPOV states [Assume Good Faith (AGF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith). Claiming to intentionally provide ""pro-Zionist removal services"" as a group violates Wikipedia's NPOV and definitely AGF, however I do not have the permission to [post a NPOV Dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view/Noticeboard) (maybe someone could help?). That particular user has been reported for this in July, however they are still actively editing content. Apparently Wikipedia has special tags for such behavior i.e. NOTHERE and BADFAITH.

I'm all for discourse in good faith, presenting multiple views. I'm against deliberately turning Wikipedia into a private lie-by-omission narrative."

Like many, I believed Israel was justified in responding forcefully to such an attack, especially when dealing with groups like Hamas, which have a history of violence and terrorism targeting civilians. However, after joining this subreddit, I have tried to make a conscious effort to see other perspectives and really understand why people criticize Israel‚Äôs actions, even when it seems like they are simply trying to protect their country.

What has become especially confusing for me is the growing condemnation of Israel, particularly after the Hezbollah-related attacks that followed. I know that many people are horrified by the civilian casualties in Gaza, and I understand why there is outrage over that ‚Äî the loss of innocent lives is always tragic. But what I find hard to grasp is why some people go beyond condemning those specific events and seem to object to the overall mission to dismantle terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. Isn‚Äôt it widely accepted that organizations like these, which openly engage in terrorism and attack civilians, need to be stopped?

In Australia, where I live, we‚Äôve seen massive protests in the streets, with many people condemning Israel not just for its tactics but specifically for actions like the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah. These protests were surprising to me because I‚Äôve always understood Hezbollah, along with Hamas, to be terrorist organizations that present a clear threat to peace and stability. Nasrallah is often portrayed as a heroic figure by some, yet Hezbollah is responsible for a range of violent acts, including attacks on civilians and terrorist operations that have claimed many lives over the years.

I‚Äôve also had conversations with people who challenge the very label of ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù when it comes to Hamas and Hezbollah. Some have argued that these groups are not terrorists at all but rather freedom fighters or resistance movements. This perspective is deeply confusing to me. As I understand it, both Hamas and Hezbollah are widely recognized as terrorist organizations, including by countries like the United States, Canada, the European Union, and Australia itself.

So my questions are these: Isn‚Äôt the mission to take down terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah a good thing? After all, these groups are responsible for acts of terrorism that have caused untold suffering for civilians. And secondly, isn‚Äôt it a factual, widely accepted reality that both Hamas and Hezbollah are recognized as terrorist organizations by a majority of the international community? Why, then, do so many people seem to either downplay or outright reject this fact? It leaves me wondering if I‚Äôm missing something important in the global conversation about these conflicts."
1frx5sg,The differences between the northern and southern fronts,2024-09-29 05:21:25,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1frx5sg/the_differences_between_the_northern_and_southern/,"The infiltration and patient planning of the dismemberment of Hizbollah in front of the whole world is remarkable. Israel's planning and subterfuge are so impressive that we might forget that the Israeli defense establishment was caught unaware by Hamas last year and then bombed rather indiscriminately, impulsively, and ineffectively in Gaza for the first few months of the war there, contributing to international condemnation. As it turns out, the initial bombing with even gigantic bombs did not significantly affect Hamas' tunnel network. Even now, with thousands of Hamas prisoners, Sinwar is still at large. 

Why? Would the claustrophobic environment of Gaza mean that any device-based or in-person contact with someone connected to the Mossad would be difficult, and any possible incentive noticed? Hizbollah is in a more porous environment, and there would be ways to reward informants that might not be detected. Is there something structural about Hamas vis a vis Hizbollah rather than the different settings of Lebanon and Gaza? 

In Gaza, ever move Israel has taken could be predicted: first air attack, the ground troops, buffer zone, etc. In Lebanon, the IDF and Mossad have executed surprise after surprise. Again, why is there such a difference in tactics? Intelligence, again? 

The Israeli-Lebanese border was quiet from 2006 to 2023. That period was the most peaceful period on the border since decolonization. But Israel was not complacent and was preparing the groundwork for the successes we've seen in recent weeks for years during a period of calm. Yet, complacency on the Gaza border seems to have been a major contributing factor to October 7. Did Israel not take Hamas as seriously as Hizbollah or did the Mossad find Hamas a harder nut to crack? 

Israel wants the West to think of them as a civilized nation of laws but wants the neighbors to know that they don't play, full stop. Hassan Nasrallah might have been listening to the Western side of the message as the local, neighborhood side of the message is not delivered in words but in deeds. 

Now that Hizbollah may have chain of command problems, shouldn't Israel invade and cross the border now, maybe only as a means to get fighters out of entrenched defensive positions? Could Israel then invade by sea in an unexpected assault north of the Litani River? They are off balance and it might be smart to keep them off balance, taking unexpected moves. Hizbollah can regroup quickly if Israel steps back now, I would think, as Iran can re-arm them. 

Anyway, that's my question.

Had Biden & Harris gotten their way, one of the most dangerous terrorists to ever live would still be alive.

Should Biden & Harris apologize for their idiotic demand that would have made the world much less safe for many years to come?

With Hezbollah's communications destroyed and most of their leadership killed, with Nasrallah ready to be hit next, and Hezbollah on the verge of completely collapsing, Biden & Harris rushed in to demand 21 days for them to recover and re-arm. Why?

For those who missed it, this was the statement released on Wednesday:

""The situation between Lebanon and Israel since October 8th, 2023 is intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation. This is in nobody‚Äôs interest, neither of the people of Israel nor of the people of Lebanon.

Diplomacy however cannot succeed amid an escalation of this conflict.  

Thus we call for an immediate 21 day ceasefire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement consistent with UNSCR 1701, and the implementation of UNSCR 2735 regarding a ceasefire in Gaza

We call on all parties, including the Governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary ceasefire immediately consistent with UNSCR 1701 during this period, and to give a real chance to a diplomatic settlement.  

We are then prepared to fully support all diplomatic efforts to conclude an agreement between Lebanon and Israel within this period, building on efforts over the last months, that ends this crisis altogether."""
1frtyvy,What's Next for Lebanon?,2024-09-29 02:07:08,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1frtyvy/whats_next_for_lebanon/,"
With Hezbollah significantly weakened, It seems there's a power vacuum taking place in Lebanon, which raises concerns for domestic unrest.

Does the Lebanese government hold any control over Lebanon's large population centers? What is possibility that domestically unrest will erupt and/or civil war?

It's a very frightening time for Lebanon. Hezbollah was not a benign force, but any such power vacuum can have serious and  unpredictable repercussions. As an example, Iraq after Saddam's ouster resulted in Isis, Assad's loss of control resulted in complete chaos in Syria. 

On the other hand, there's also the possibility that Lebanon can realize the harms of associating with Teheran and start turning inward and into rebuilding itself. Given Lebanon's dysfunction, it's fractured society, and it's weak governments, this seems like a very unlikely outcome. 

Of course even before any long term outlooks can be entertained we need to first see how the current situation unfolds. Israel seems keen on continuing to strike Hezbollah. Hezbollah is continuing to fire rockets, although probably with much less impact as much of its leadership gone. Israel may plan a ground invasion, and that itself can have serious ramifications on Lebanon's internal state, although indications are it will be a small scale incursion into the south only. Iran's response is also very unclear at this point. I doubt they will strike Israel directly however they will likely attempt to funnel more resources into Hezbollah in order to rehabilitate it.

All that being said, I feel horrible for the Lebanese who are taking hit after hit. I'm afraid that civil war and complete chaos are not unlikely.  

Can anyone from Lebanon let us know what your thoughts are?"

1frhbrz,Israel‚Äôs Proxy War Headache: How Iran Keeps Handing Out Rockets Like Free Samples,2024-09-28 15:53:00,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1frhbrz/israels_proxy_war_headache_how_iran_keeps_handing/,"You ever have that one neighbor who doesn't do anything themselves but somehow always causes trouble? Yeah, that‚Äôs Iran in the Middle East right now. Instead of going toe-to-toe with Israel directly, Iran is the guy that hands out baseball bats to everyone on the block and tells them to go break windows for him. It's like the ultimate game of ""not my problem"" ‚Äì except with rockets, drones, and proxy armies. Lucky Israel, right?

So let‚Äôs break down Iran‚Äôs game plan, or what I like to call their **""Here, You Fight Israel for Me"" Strategy**:

**Step 1: Find a Proxy**  
Iran doesn‚Äôt exactly like getting its hands dirty. Instead of jumping into the ring, they play the puppet master, arming and funding various groups that, for lack of a better phrase, *really* hate Israel. First, it was **Hamas**, then **Hezbollah**, and now we‚Äôve got the **Houthis** down in Yemen making some noise. It's like they have their own Grim Reaper making house calls on behalf of Tehran (seriously, see my meme below).

These proxies don‚Äôt just have slingshots and angry slogans either. Thanks to Iran, they're packing drones, missiles, and rockets like they're on some Middle Eastern version of *America's Got (Explosive) Talent*. And who are they performing for? Yep, Israel.

**Step 2: The Rocket Roulette**  
So what does Israel get in return? A never-ending game of **Rocket Roulette**, where every few months (or days, depending on the season), a different proxy decides to launch a barrage at Israeli cities. Israel has to be ready to dodge, block, and retaliate. Meanwhile, Iran sits back like, ‚ÄúHey, I didn‚Äôt do it!‚Äù

Just picture it: The Iron Dome is like Israel's umbrella in a never-ending storm of rockets, and it's raining‚Äî**a lot**. Sometimes it‚Äôs Hamas from Gaza with their home-brewed rockets; other times it‚Äôs Hezbollah, sneaking missiles out of southern Lebanon like they‚Äôre delivering pizzas. And now the Houthis have joined the party by tossing drones and missiles from Yemen. Everyone wants a slice of the action, apparently.

**Step 3: International Side-Eye**  
But here‚Äôs the best part: Every time Israel retaliates, suddenly, **it‚Äôs Israel that gets the side-eye** from the international community. Imagine you‚Äôre in your house, dodging baseballs coming through your windows, and the minute you grab a bat to protect yourself, everyone‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúHey, chill out, Israel. Don‚Äôt overreact.‚Äù

Meanwhile, Iran‚Äôs sitting there sipping tea, saying, ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not *me* launching the rockets. I just happened to, uh, *supply* them.‚Äù

It's like Israel‚Äôs dealing with a professional arsonist who's also selling fire insurance on the side.

**Step 4: The Endless Proxy Parade**  
And if you think it stops with Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, think again. Iran‚Äôs proxy parade never ends. Just when you think you've handled one, another one shows up with a fresh delivery of rockets. It‚Äôs like that whack-a-mole game, but the moles have AK-47s and a grudge.

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of Iran‚Äôs **""Go Fight Israel for Me"" Army**:

* **Hamas**: The OG proxy, Gaza-based rocket launchers who never met a ceasefire they didn‚Äôt break.
* **Hezbollah**: Lebanon‚Äôs missile maestros, always ready to send some love (by love, I mean rockets) from the north.
* **Houthis**: Yemen‚Äôs newest addition to the club, because apparently you can never have too many proxies launching missiles at Israel.

So, what does Israel do? Build a bigger umbrella. The Iron Dome keeps the worst of it out, but there's only so much you can do when your neighbors keep borrowing Iran‚Äôs bat.

**Step 5: The Meme of It All**  
Here‚Äôs where we get to my favorite part: the meme.

[https://imgflip.com/i/94zez4](https://imgflip.com/i/94zez4)

If Iran‚Äôs proxies were doors, the Grim Reaper would have already knocked on Hamas and Hezbollah‚Äôs doors, leaving a nice blood trail behind, and now he‚Äôs standing in front of the **Houthis' door**, scythe in hand, ready to make his next move. And Israel? Well, Israel‚Äôs stuck cleaning up the mess every time.

**Conclusion: What Now?**  
So yeah, it‚Äôs a tough gig being Israel in the Middle East right now. You‚Äôre stuck playing defense 24/7, dodging rockets like it‚Äôs a national sport, and half the world still points fingers at you for being ""too harsh"" when you fight back. Meanwhile, Iran just keeps finding new ways to stir the pot without ever showing up to the actual fight.

What‚Äôs next? Honestly, probably more of the same. More rockets, more finger-pointing, and more ‚ÄúWait, you want me to just *not* defend myself?‚Äù moments.

But hey, at least we get some memes out of it. Stay safe, Israel‚Äîyou‚Äôve got a lot of people throwing bats at your windows."
1freb91,Why do people call Israelis Nazis?,2024-09-28 13:28:39,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1freb91/why_do_people_call_israelis_nazis/,"I think that they are trying to use an inflammatory term for a disliked army, and the Nazis is the first one that came up in their Facebook searches (putting aside that they weren't an army, the army being the Wehrmacht). Just because everyone and their mother has either has or has met someone calling jews Nazis it is important to know specific events greatly distinguishing the two. Putting aside the holocaust itself, there was an event where the Nazis gathered an entire Jewish population of a Russian town, took them all to a ravine, and shot them one by one. 33000 bodies were shot into a gorge, a greater number than even Hamas claims have been killed by collateral after almost a year. Also ghettoes, the camps, and all of that. Just this is a specific important event that has an evil shock factor, and any statement other than those that affirm the distinction could easily be seen as evil since they would all have to involve the sentiment that those people mattered less because they were Jewish.

For more information I would highly recommend watching the documentary Evil on Trial.

Another is that during operation Barbarossa, the Wehrmacht had special divisions with orders to kill all found ""undesirable"" civilians. This resulted in 1.5 MILLION deaths known as a Holocaust by bullets. On top of this, the leaders of the army called the war a war of extermination with the dedicated goal of murdering as many people as possible. The Israeli commanders' main goal is to eliminate terrorists while preserving human life, and the ratio of dead soldiers to dead civilians is really quite good compared to other wars."
1fr9kjf,IDF says Hezbollah terror chief Hassan Nasrallah was killed in Beirut strike,2024-09-28 08:11:01,282,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fr9kjf/idf_says_hezbollah_terror_chief_hassan_nasrallah/,"The IDF announces that Hezbollah terror chief Hassan Nasrallah was killed in yesterday‚Äôs airstrike in Beirut.  
  
Link to Times of Israel article [here](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-september-28-2024/).

After a year of bombardment from Hezbollah, triggered by Hamas' massacre of Israelis on the 7th of October, Israel is fighting back in Lebanon.

So far, over 250 Israeli hostages were taken, and over 1700 Israelis dead, the majority civilian. More than 20 thousand rockets have been fired at Israel from Gaza, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, and Yemen.

Last night, Israel took out the leader of the largest terror organization (or call it ""non-state military"" if you find ""terror"" to be a loaded term). This follows successful strikes against a large amount of Hezbollah leadership, and an audacious operation that culminated in the explosion of thousands of pagers and walkie talkies held by Hezbollah operatives.

What do you believe is next? Will Israel mount a ground invasion? What will Hezbollah, and even Iran's response look like?"
1fr8772,Why ‚ÄòZionism‚Äô is a bogus term,2024-09-28 06:30:34,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fr8772/why_zionism_is_a_bogus_term/,"What do Empiricism, Idealism, Realism, Behaviourism, Humanism, Feminism, Romanticism, Existentialism, Surrealism, Modernism, Fascism, Capitalism, or Communism have in common?

Whether artistic, philosophical, or political, these -isms refer to an idea, concept, or school of thought.

They are abstract.

But have you ever heard of Pakistanism, Jordanism, Bangladeshism, Malaysianism, or any other ‚Äò-ism‚Äô used today to refer to 50+ countries created after WWII?

No, that‚Äôd be absurd because once established, countries¬†*exist*, are¬†*concrete*, and we don‚Äôt apply abstract terms (-isms) to them‚Ä¶ except when we do.

The exception is, of course, ‚ÄòZionism,‚Äô a popular term used left right and centre.

I‚Äôm not surprised to hear Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, ISIS, Taliban, or Al Qaeda talk about the ‚ÄòZionist regime.‚Äô These Islamic, anti-Semitic countries/organizations don‚Äôt recognize the state of Israel and therefore refer to it in abstract terms. Makes sense.

But others using the terms ‚ÄòZionism‚Äô and ‚Äòanti-Zionism‚Äô are, at best, dishonest. Hiding behind these terms not to come across as overtly anti-Semitic, they are nonetheless on the same plane as Hamas or Iran, who are at least clear about their intentions. By referring to a concrete country in abstract terms, the Western ‚Äúanti-Zionists‚Äù deny Israel‚Äôs very existence just by uttering those terms. It‚Äôs devilishly simple.

The term ‚ÄòZionism‚Äô¬†*did*¬†make sense ‚Äî in 1880, 1930, or 1947. But post-1948, it makes as much sense as Algerianism.

In the West, the so-called anti-Zionists usually say something like: ‚ÄúI have nothing against the Jews, but I have a problem with the state of Israel, with¬†*Zionism.*‚Äù

Yeah sure.

I consider the Israeli-Palestinian conflict insoluble, largely because both parties are ‚Äúright,‚Äù and you can, depending on whose side you stand, string a perfectly coherent argument for your favourite, and back it up with facts. There is no need to repeat them here and you can go back one (October 7th), or 2500 years.

But imagine this:

You have a bird‚Äôs-eye view of the Israel proper, the West Bank, and Gaza, but you don‚Äôt see beyond. Such a view must, I believe, lead to a conclusion that the Palestinians are ‚ÄòDavid‚Äô, and the Israelis ‚ÄòGoliath‚Äô.

Now, imagine zooming out, expanding your view, and broadening your radius say, by 2000 kms with Israel at the centre. Is Israel not David and the surrounding countries (incl. Iran, Yemen, Turkey..) Goliath?

The answer is clear.

But what if you zoom out to the max? The UN, which is the closest approximation of such a global view, is clearly Goliath.

So when Sam Harris says, having criticized organized religion in general:

‚Äú‚Ä¶If we need a state organized around any religious minority, the last lingering justification for a religious ethno-state, let‚Äôs give that to the Jews, given the history, given the current level of anti-Semitism‚Ä¶‚Äù

I agree with him.

The Jews were, are, and will be a tiny minority, David, and their state must be protected.

I have no idea what that means for the Palestinians, who are also at home on their land. No one knows how to untie ‚Äî cut ‚Äî this Gordian knot, this bug light that for some reason captivates the world!

1fr4qou,Anyone else thinks Israel has been planning this war with Hezbollah for many many years ?,2024-09-28 02:45:43,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fr4qou/anyone_else_thinks_israel_has_been_planning_this/,"Hamas‚Äôs Oct 7th, caught Israel off guard. But Israel and IDF had always been very cautious of Hezbollah in the north. IDF always had their eyes, ears and mind on Hezbollah, so much so Israel and IDF made the mistake of underestimating Hamas. 

1. Anyone else thinks Israel has been planning this war with Hezbollah for many many years ? There is no way IDF did not have several offensive plans seeing Hezbollah amassing 150,000 rockets at its borders for almost 20 years and in breach of agreed UN Resolution 1701 back in 2006. 

2. UN failed to implement UN Resolution 1701 for almost 20 years. 10,000+ UNIFIL peacekeepers based in south Lebanon were unable or unwilling or could not implement UN resolution 1701, Israel is once again forced to rely on IDF to get the job done. But when IDF enters Lebanon, I think IDF will not stop at the Litani river, it‚Äôs not solely about doing UN‚Äôs job. I think IDF wants to destroy most of the 150,000 rockets, most are believed to be located in south Lebanon, but the long range and more lethal missiles (Scud, Fateh, etc‚Ä¶) are belived to be in north Lebanon. IDF will continue push beyond Litani river especially in the north east Hezbollah region next to Syria and destroy Hezbollah fighters and armaments. I think IDF will enter Beirut.

3. When IDF entered Gaza, I think Israel ‚Äúkinda‚Äù had a plan, sort of, albeit a not very good one‚Ä¶ not well thought through, they were mostly driven by emotions and anger. So the plan was changing, confusing, leaders are saying different things, needless to say messy. When Israel withdrew from Gaza back in 2005, it didnt have a very strong intel on the ground in Gaza since. When IDF entered Gaza, it was going in blind,‚Ä¶no idea where is Yahya Sinwar, no idea where exactly are the hostages. In comparison, Israel has alot of good intel on Hezbollah. Have you noticed this Operation North Arrow, people (IDF, leaders) are more tight lip, they are not saying much, a stark contrast compared to Operation in Gaza. Lets see how IDF goes with this. It felt like Nethanyahu and IDF want to redeem themselves, that also means they will try to do more and overcompensate‚Ä¶ it wont be like 2006‚Ä¶expect bigger.

4. Hezbollah‚Äôs reaction in recent days is abit underwhelming, for the most heavily armed non-state group in the world. Nasrallah got killed in Beirut southern suburbs (confirmed). Those pagers and walkie-talkie explosions must have severely weaken Hezbollah, making communication and organization difficult. I think the war wont stop even if Nasrallah was killed, there will be another replacement leader. It will surely be a heavy blow to Hezbollah without Nasrallah, but there are still 150,000 rockets on Israel‚Äôs border, Israel‚Äôs concerns still remains. Until most of these rockets are destroyed, significant numbers of Hezbollah disarmed and Hezbollah will not be able to re-arm, never again, this war will continue.

5. I think as far as Israel is concerned, Hezbollah has nothing to do with Hamas or Palestine, and Hezbollah should never had gotten involved. These are two separate wars, with different military objectives. But Hezbollah is seeing Hamas, Palestine, Islamic Republic of Iran, Houthis and Hezbollah‚Äôs fight with Israel are all related, Nasrallah is doing some jihad, holy war stuff, which unfortunately is dragging the whole Lebanon into war.

I've seen plenty of times the argument that under IHL, Palestinians have the right to resist, via violence, Israel because Israel is oppressing and colonizing them.

Most of the time, this is in response to being asked questions such as:

* Do you condemn Hamas?
* What about 10/7?

Where or not it does, for this hypothetical, let's say IHL does allow the right to resist, via violence, against an occupying colonizer.

Now let's say a country invades your country, kicks you out of your homes, and oppresses and colonizes you and your people. If the way that Palestinians have been resisting Israel's occupation and colonization is allowed under IHL, then how long before you would do as they have done?

How long before you fire rockets into the other country indiscriminately like [Palestinians have been doing for decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel)?

How long before you drive a bus full of civilians off a cliff like [Palestinians did in 1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tel_Aviv%E2%80%93Jerusalem_bus_attack)?

How long before you blow yourself up in a middle of bunch of civilians like [Palestinians did in 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_massacre)?

How long before you blow up a school bus full of children like [Palestinians did in 1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avivim_school_bus_bombing)?

How long before you strap explosives to a 14 year old boy and send him at your colonizers to blow himself up like [Palestinians did in 2004 to Hussam Abdo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussam_Abdo)?

How long before you do any of the terrible things [Palestinian terrorist groups have done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Terrorist_attacks_attributed_to_Palestinian_militant_groups)?

How many children would you kill to get your occupiers to leave?

Please no whataboutism regarding terrible things that Israel done, or has done. It shouldn't be hard to talk about how you would violently resist an occupation without bringing up Israel.

If you ***do*** feel the need to bring up Israel, please explain how any of Israel's actions justify the murder of children and using them as suicide bombers.

Thanks!"
1fqspd4,I think the world has underestimated exactly how mad Israel was at Hezbollah...,2024-09-27 17:06:56,206,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fqspd4/i_think_the_world_has_underestimated_exactly_how/,"Writing this on 27th September, just after a massive Israeli strike has apparently levelled at least 4 buildings in the Dahieh suburb of Beirut, apparently on Hezbollah's main HQ, ostensibly hidden underground... now above ground.

[https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c981g8mrl8lt](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c981g8mrl8lt)

The past 10 days of constant strikes across Lebanon on Hezbollah, destroying weapon stockpiles, launchers and  apparently killing several commanders. (Let's see what this massive strike brings but apparently the BBC just reported that the AP has confirmed Nasrallah is still alive).

EDIT: They got him. Nasrallah, head of Hezbollah, killed in that strike.

Hezbollah grew and benefited from the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in the early 2000s. During that time, it continued it's planning, until 2006, where essentially (comments will disagree) it managed to embarrass Israel by attacking and kidnapping 2 Israeli soldiers... pulled Israel into a month long confrontation that led to inconclusive results, paralysed the North, and left it with none of its war goals met.

Worse, after protracted negotiation, releasing several Hezbollah terrorists, Israel was given 2 coffins containing the bodies of the soldiers in return....

(Worth repeating that this was the end of Olmert's government and of the left getting into govt, as of 2024. Possibly worth mentioning particularly for those wondering how Israel turned and remained so right wing)

There have been tit for tat engagements over  the years. but nothing that conflagrated into a full conflict.

Then Oct. 7th happened, one of the darkest events in Israeli history, and most definitely recent Jewish history. Hezbollah obviously took Hamas side and the day after, began firing on Northern Israel.

This remained low key until about a month ago (or has it been two) where apparently a Hezbollah missile hit a children's playground killing 12 children. Israel responded with a surgical strike killing Fuad Shukr. Rockets kept coming. Maybe back to this low key tit for that episode? No, as we found out 10 days ago.

Israel clearly, as shown with the pagers, walkie talkies, and location of Hezbollah bases, has been preparing for this for years, almost as if it was waiting for the right moment to unleash utter hellfire.

And that is what we've seen, a ruthless vengance, unabated over the past 10 days, attacking anything in South Lebanon attached to Hezbollah.

This goes all the way to a few hours ago, Netanyahu giving a speech to the United Nations, with the attack taking place on Hezbollah HQ just as he finished his speech. (Reminder, similar drone attack, among the first of its kind, on an Israeli ship by Hezbollah in the middle of a Nasrallah speech in the opening phases of the 2006 war)

As Macron and Biden sit around talking about ceasefires, Israel is having none of it.

If Israel was a single person and had a voice I could imagine the quotes:

*""21 day ceasefire? Plenty of time for those with the charred corpses that will remain when we're done with them""*

*""Another one bites the dust""* ***\*strikes off another name on the leadership chart, each with an exact address\****

*""Here's your solidarity strikes back""*

It's as if Israel has waited 18 years for this, planned it out meticulously and no force in the world is going to stop it until it pays Hezbollah back with interest for 2006."

It appears to me that the news produced for the Palestinian people has not been reaching the western masses. Do people actually listen and try to understand what the primary propagandists are producing in their own language or do they depend on the translation and resulting slant of major journalism to inform?

It's one thing to listen to a tik tok influencer or undergraduate who repeats buzz phrases as observer and it's another entirely to hear actual affected people who live in the culture and experience the effects of conflict in their lives.

Although I have been much more inquisitive about the nature of truth in this particular information war since Oct 7, it was only last night that I discovered PalWatch through TravellingIsrael.

[This](https://youtu.be/vGIXfzUU5hM?si=kZEvE_3Lom-ihlQ2) is one of Oren's most impressive productions as his analysis and commentary on Bassem Youssef and his explanation for Bassem's views is very well researched and delivered even more more humorously than the supposed comedian.

In any event, now that I've consumed and digested a great deal of Palestinian TV, which seemed inaccessible and unavailable mere days before, I wonder if this is by design.

What is preventing this channel and this footage from being seen by the tik tok crowd or the academics or mainstream media?

Are we going to pretend that Hebron, the site of the Cave of Patriarchs, where Abraham first migrated to, where David was anointed King of Israel, where Malkiel Ashkenazi and other Jews constructed the Avraham Avinu Synagogue in 1540, and where one of the largest Jewish communities in the Levant of 1000 Jews existed in 1820, *isn't* Israel?

Are we going to pretend that Acre, the base of operations for Zahir al-Umar, the leader of the Palestinians in the 18th century, who is remembered today for his resistance against Ottoman assaults, successful trade with Europe and tolerance of Christian and Jewish immigrants, or Ramle, where the Umayyad-era White Mosque was built, or Avdat, the Unesco World Heritage site built by the Arab Nabataeans around the 1st century BC, which used to be the second most important city in the Incense Route between Arabia and the Mediterranean, and where Obodas 1., the Nabataean king who defeated both the Hasmoneans and Seleucids was deified and buried, *aren't* Palestine?

Face it, Jews and Arabs have to share this land, two states, one state or elsewise, and they must sooner or later accept each other's narratives as indigenous people to the land. Arbitrary distinctions of where Israel ends and Palestine begins are useless."

1fqfzur,Israel is good because they protect Israelis. Palestine is bad because they harm Palestinians,2024-09-27 04:49:29,170,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fqfzur/israel_is_good_because_they_protect_israelis/,"Too many times, I see people coming to the conclusion that ""Israel is bad because they killed more Palestinians than Palestine killed Israelis""

This is a complete inversion of responsibilities. As the Israeli government, their job first and foremost is to protect the people of Israel. Likewise, it is the Palestinian government's (Hamas) job to protect the people of Palestine.

This is what the Israeli government has done to keep Israelis safe:

- Construct bomb shelters in every building
- Air raid sirens in every city to warn Israelis that they are under attack and to seek shelter
- Researched and developed one of the most advanced networks of missile defense systems, which includes the Iron Dome, David Sling, Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 
- Invest a significant portion of their GDP into military to protect its people
- Seek out alliances both globally (USA/UK/France/Germany) and regionally (Jordan/Egypt/Saudi Arabia/UAE)


This is what the Palestinian government has done to harm Palestinians:

- Store weapons and explosives in schools
- Build 0 tunnels for Palestinians to seek shelter in
- Rob its citizens of aid meant for them
- Execute and torture those who speak out against them
- Fire missiles and rockets near civilian areas
- Militants dress in civilian clothes instead of uniforms which endangers those around them
- Launched an invasion against a nuclear armed state of which they have a 0% chance of defeating militarily

Israel is not ""bad"" for harming Palestinians because it is not their primary responsibility to protect them. Likewise, Palestine is not ""good"" for failing to harm Israelis, that's simply stealing credit from the IDF for doing a good job of protecting its people.

Rather, Israel is good because they protect their own people, and Palestine is bad because they harm their own people."

That way, no one should be in Gaza and much easier to search.

The Jews can comb over every nook and cranny of Gaza to look for tunnels, weapons, terrorists etc.

Edit 1 - Everyone is searched for weapons prior to leaving Gaza

Edit 2 - They are transported to the camp and not permitted to leave until the search of Gaza is complete at which point, they would be securely transported back"
1fq8tt4,What‚Äôs the day after plan for Lebanon?,2024-09-26 22:28:07,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fq8tt4/whats_the_day_after_plan_for_lebanon/,"Israel's offensive against Hezbollah has been devastating so far. With a combination of comms sabotage and overwhelming air supremacy, Israel has reportedly destroyed twenty years worth of Hezbollah‚Äôs materiel and troop buildup. Troops are now massed at the border, and Ben Gvir has threatened to withdraw from the government if Israel agrees to a ceasefire brokered by the U.S. and France. A ground invasion seems increasingly likely.

Assuming Israel proceeds with a bloody ground war against Hezbollah and wins, what happens next?

UNIFIL has proven completely ineffective and has effectively become a meme. The umbrella which closes when it rains.

That leaves us with two main options:
1. Withdrawal back to Israel after weakening Hezbollah militarily, ensuring that they‚Äôre no longer an immediate threat. Completely neutralizing them is not feasible, as they could rebuild with continued Iranian support, especially if there is no long-term solution.
   
2. Occupy parts of Lebanon, as was done in 1982, though this presents significant challenges today:
   - The Maronite Christian population in Lebanon has declined significantly since the Civil War and no longer holds the political power they once did. Although Lebanon's confessional system still reserves key positions for Christians, their influence is much weaker
   - The South Lebanon Army (SLA), which once supported Israeli forces during the previous occupation, was disbanded after Israel‚Äôs withdrawal in 2000. This means Israel would not have local militia support, making an occupation even more difficult.

Between 1982 and 2000, Israel lost close to 700 soldiers due to constant guerrilla warfare, primarily from Hezbollah. Public pressure within Israel, especially from the families of soldiers, combined with a lack of clear strategic gains, ultimately led to Israel‚Äôs withdrawal. The occupation, while aimed at curbing Palestinian militant activity and later Hezbollah, actually played a significant role in Hezbollah‚Äôs rise to power, aided by Iranian and Syrian support. Hezbollah transformed from a small militia into the dominant political and military force in Lebanon with tremendous support from the local Shiite population who view them as liberators.

Both options are horrible but out of all the potential bad options, what‚Äôs the best course of action for long-term peace and stability in the region?"

Israel Iives RENT FREE in their heads. It doesn't matter if they are at work, at home, weekends, weekdays, morning or night, there will always be an ""update"" or message in the family group chat about how Israel did this, or that or some kind of other horrible thing. Which I get. It's a brutal conflict but it's come to a point where much of the family doesn't really interact with each other anymore unless it's Israel Palestine related. 

Take me for example, if my older brother ever calls me it's almost always for a favor he needs and not just to talk to see how I am doing. And the favor is often demanded and not so much asked. Aldo there's this obsession with constantly harping on Israelis and jews as a whole, as if every single Jewish person on the planet is eating Palestinians for breakfast or something. It's getting really inundated and nobody seems to care about each other persay. I know that when I send a message in the family group chat it often gets ignored or barely addressed if at all. But I guarantee it if I happened to be a Palestinian they would be all over me. We are not arabs like I said, we hail from Eastern Europe but it's getting really annoying to see them talking about this conflict as if we actually have some skin in the game. Like we have actual relatives back home, in Europe that are quite literally suffering as well, but nobody cares about them. It's so sickening. And I am tired of it. "
1fq0ut5,Bringing people back from maximalism?,2024-09-26 16:48:17,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fq0ut5/bringing_people_back_from_maximalism/,"Perhaps it's best to start out with my own personal story. I am a Jewish person and still left-leaning, but for a while identified as a pretty solid leftist and momentarily may have considered myself an anti-zionist. This attachment to external identity caused me to be someone who accused Israel of genocide early on in the conflict, but then I started having somewhat of a reverse awakening. I still think Israel is obnoxiously committing a host of abuses (both before and since October 7), but I wasn't so sure I felt comfortable in ideological camps that couldn't seem to be self-reflective of the atrocities Hamas inflicted upon Israel. Many seemed to insist they *knew* that October 7 was an obvious response to Israel's aggression. I no longer believe that. October 7 was deliberately inhumane, and I don't see that as a fight for freedom, even as I know people believe in the Nat Turner analogy (at this time, I do not). I still lean far to the left and hope for a ceasefire in the name of humanity. However, I do now recognize that the fear of Hamas repeating horrific actions is a reasonable one; I just think that Israel will be vigilant, and that I believe this moment can be leveraged for a more durable peace. Israel, after all, is not innocent either.

Anyway, on to the question of this post. It seems to me that there are people plunged into either extreme of this conflict, and that deep-down, on some subconscious level, they don't actually believe *all* of what they espouse, but they keep toeing the maximalist line for some reason. However, I think tendencies on each extreme are also quite different.

Those who sympathize with Palestine have their hearts tuned in to the oppressed people of the world. This is why I do have some patience for them. However, I think they are oversimplifying the situation. Understandably, they are afraid of yielding an inch lest pro-Israelis take a mile. However, having this mentality can make conversations feel as if they are competitions.

Those who sympathize with Israel to the point of saying Israel absolutely needs to keep fighting until Hamas is eliminated have a very one-sided point of view. I respect the ""call a spade a spade"" type of reaction to a Hamas, which is also why I have some patience for them as well, but I think their willingness to sacrifice innocent Palestinians (or worse, say there ""are no"" innocent Palestinians) makes them take very tribal, which, in turn, comes out as somewhat supremacist (Jewish supremacist or otherwise). After all, none of us would want to suffer as Palestinians are suffering for decisions made by enormous institutions, democratically elected or otherwise.

Anyway, does any of this resonate with any of you? Do you see any flaws in my thinking? And, most importantly, how has your engagement been with hardliners on either side? Do you think that maximalism is actually the way to go, or are you like me and think that compromise is going to be necessary? Do you have any suggestions about engaging people when discussing these heavy issues?

3. Just implement UN security council resolution 1701, get Hezbollah to withdraw north of the Litani river and stop firing rockets at Israel. If UN is unable or unwilling to implement UN security council resolution 1701, what do you expect Israel to do after Hezbollah fired more than 19,000 rockets at Israel displacing more than 60,000 Israelis from their homes for almost a year ?

4. Back in November 2023, Foreign Minister Eli Cohen led foreign ambassadors on a tour of Israel‚Äôs northern border, told the diplomats that unless Hezbollah withdraws its forces north of the Litani River, in compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1701, Israel will be forced to remove Hezbollah from the border by force. https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-779739.

Here's a brief summary for those that have not read it:

Before Antony Blinken addressed US Congress saying ‚ÄúWe do not currently assess that the Israeli government is prohibiting or otherwise restricting the transport or delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance.‚Äù, Blinken allegedly recieved reports from two government agencies which found that Israel HAD intentionally blocked humanitarian aid. They concluded that sending military aid to Israel would illegal under US law based on their finding regarding the blocking of aid into Gaza.

Here is the full article: https://www.propublica.org/article/gaza-palestine-israel-blocked-humanitarian-aid-blinken

Personally, I am upset by Antony Blinken clear lack of transparency with the findings of USAID and the head of the State Department‚Äôs Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration. I do want to personally read these reports soon, but I have no I herent reason to question these government institutions and am unaware of any bias inherent to either of them. All that said, I don't think congress or Joey Biden would do anything at all differently.

In my opinion, it seems like Blinken Blatantly lied/withheld information, however, he did this to a congress that seems like they want to be lied to regarding this particular issue.

Regardless of your thoughts generally on the ethics of conditions or withholding military aid to Israel, I just want peoples honest and raw reactions to this article. For example:

- is there anything you feel should be represented in this article that is not present?

- do you feel Blinken lied?

- do you feel the assessments of these two government bodies lied or were otherwise bias/wrong?

- does knowing this change anything regarding US-Israel relations? "
1fpmmvi,What would be your preferred solution to ensure the safety of the Jewish People Post-WW2?,2024-09-26 03:05:59,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fpmmvi/what_would_be_your_preferred_solution_to_ensure/,"I've been following the Israel/Palestine conflict for a while now, and while I've always held the belief that the initial formation of the Jewish State was in of itself unjust, we are now living in a more complex world where what's done is done, and we need to move forward and find a way to cooperate. I also believe that Israel has the right to defend itself now that it does exist. 

That being said, many people I've talked to about this subject always say that 'there were better options' or 'The Jews didn't need Palestine, they could have found a better solution' when talking about the initial formation of Israel, which is something I've wondered for a while. But whenever I ask where the Jews should have gone, or if they ever needed to go anywhere, they mostly come up blank. The two genuine solutions I have been given were:

1. Carve out a piece of Germany to serve as a Jewish State. This seems like the most popular alternative _now,_ but whenever I think about this from a mid 20th century perspective I feel that this would be an incredibly problematic option since the Germans, especially those still sympathetic to the Nazis, would see this as proof that the Jews are in control, and I doubt many Jewish people would want to remain in Germany. 
2. Sitka Alaska. Sitka Alaska was offered up, but the Alaskans and the Jews both denied this. I do agree that being sent to some cold backwater (sorry Alaska, no disrespect) would be seen as akin to Hitler's plan to send all the Jews to Madagascar to fend for themselves. It sounds like a way to just get rid of the Jews and send them off somewhere. 

So do any of you have any better solutions than these?"

In less than a year the Rwanda genocide took 800k plus lives. By roving bands of lunatics. 

The Armenian genocide costed 1 million lives in a year. These happened over a larger territorial holdings than the strip.  By ww1 arms in one case.  In rifles and machete like meele weapons in another. I have disputed the idea of genocide since this chaos started.  To be called all sorts of names. I don't mind.  We're we to look at the total fatalities as a percentage of population i don't even think it would qualify. 


The fatalities in Gaza are horrible and a condemnation on all ppl. However they seem more in line to the destruction of total war. My title of this is half ironic. The allegations of genocide has not ended. Yet to a casual observer there is no grounds to that charge. Appearing more in line to the use the alarmist propaganda.  Than an actual genocidal plot. A nation such as Israel to have set out to commit genocide and still not be done with it. Seems to a spurious charge. They can destroy 5 armies across all it's fronts in 6 days. But cannot do this????  


I genually don't understand how this qualifies as genocide? And to my readings it seems like somewhere we conflated the indiscriminate bombings with acts of genocide and called it as such. 

Look. I genuinely believe the People of the strip got a very rotten end of the stick. Suffering from Israel's harsh retribution to the plots of Hamas. And suffering Hamas stupid leadership that knows an end to fighting means an end to their mandate.  I don't know how much Gazans support Hamas. Prior discussions with ppl attempted to separate the identities of GAZA and HAMAs and calling Hamas puppets of Israel. I found those charge spurious and biased given the apparent unwillingness to think Israeli ppls as different from the government or IDF showing bias in that regard. 

Anyway. What are the evidentiary proof of a genocide in Gaza? 

I will grant that the restoration of basic services and aid convoys are to account for ppl reaching out from the strip to ask for help in tik tok. Life always resumes it's course

What are the facts that point to a genocide happened or is happening in Gaza???

Here is a gift article from Haaretz, a left wing news source within Israel that actively opposed the current government and is highly critical of the war and the regime.
There has definitely been a sense that much of the outrage around this issue has been manufactured. Of course both sides call each other bots, but now there is hard evidence for the prevalence and scale of the issue. It's interesting to see how the double standard applied to Israel actually serves a purpose on a grand scale. Antisemitism is literally still performing a function for bad faith actors in 2024.

It‚Äôs become clear that Iran, China, and Russia actually don‚Äôt have values and merely define themselves in contrast to Western hegemony. It‚Äôs silly to see communists working with Islamists again, but ultimately it‚Äôs clear that for some groups seeing their enemies fall is more important than succeeding themselves. Is it possible that these countries have no problem applying this kind of propaganda because they allow no space for free thought anyway, so it doesn‚Äôt matter how much fake news there is? As long as you bow to Allah, or the Supreme leader, it doesn‚Äôt matter if what you think is true.

Do you think there is a way to actually manage this? Or are we in an age where media literacy means 'believe nothing llonline'? And what does that mean considering that media literacy of younger generations is abysmal.
If you support Palestine, do you see this as a legitimate tactic?

If you‚Äôre support Israel do you see this as beneficial or problematic?

If your opinions have developed in response to the media coverage since 10/7, does this change how you feel?"

I linked a piece from today's NYTimes about the IDF tearing up parts of Tulkarm and Jenin, obstructing emergency vehicles, etc. There aren‚Äôt many places on Reddit to discuss this from a pro-Israeli perspective, so I genuinely want to hear what you think, without partisan defensive bullshit. From the video and descriptions, it really seems like part of a broader campaign punishing the people there‚Äîstore owners and the municipal government‚Äîfor the actions of militants.

For context, I‚Äôm a NYC Jew who's always supported Israel's right to exist and defend itself, and I thought the war in Gaza was justified (though leaks about acceptable civilian casualties have been worrying). I  think terms like genocide and apartheid were lazy, reductionist, and pushed by bad actors.

While the non-Westerners get a pass on any bad behaviour because for Western leftists the non-Westerners were either A) wronged in a very bad way, or B) they are in lack of security, peace, and freedom; which is just about everything all people in the world need to be happy, as evidenced in the West. 

It's basically about the misaligned conception that Westerners have (including a lot of pre-7/10 centrist and leftwing Israelis) about the way of thinking that is applicable to non-Westerners such as Palestinians and the entire Arab/Muslim world to which they belong. 

So I have been thinking this; what if we can use the same logic to explain the utter vilification and hate that many Muslims and Arabs harbour for the State of Israel. 

What if Israel's worst enemies; be they the political minds and the anti-Zionist military coalition in the Middle East think that Israel follows the same values, principles and goals that they know to follow themselves. 

They hate Israel; because they believe that Israel has the same goals as themselves and the same means to achieve them, or in other words; they believe that Israel is of the same mindset as them; that they (Zionists) desire power, uniformity and control over the objects and the subjects of society. 

They (the Arab/Muslim world) explain Israel's actions using the same reasoning that they know to be true and prevalent in their own society; the total exertion of power for the sake of victory of one's own culture, language, and way of life in the available region. 

Hence, every action that is made by Israel that Israel claims to have made in self-defense, is interpreted by the Arab/Muslim world as an act of evil that has no root but in the exercise of sadism. 

No one is perfect in this regional and world-wide political conflict, but the level of animosity that I see in a lot of the anti-Zionists towards all things Israel is something that I don't usually find even in hawkish right-wing Zionists in Israel towards those of Palestinian/Arab descent."

It seems that there's never a clear outcome. Instead there's some sort of result that can be interpreted by either side as a victory. And inevitably, you see people on both sides repeating the same talking points they've been making before the war. It's frustrating how people 'stick to their guns' so to speak and fail to see the greater picture. This is true for both sides. 

Arabs for example will complain how Israel is an aggressor, a force of destruction, killing scores of civilians, destroying infrastructure and leveling towns. All the while ignoring any precipitating events. They'll ignore Hezbollah or Hamas, as if these don't exist or are not an important component or instigators in this conflict. They'll support Hezbollah/Hamas on the one hand, and on the other, will believe that Israel is at fault. 

The Israelis do the same. They keep talking about how they were struck first and needed to defend themselves. They will tally the high number of casualties on the enemy side, completely ignoring the number of civilians killed. They'll celebrate the success of high profile assassinations, forgetting that for every senior commander killed, multiple others will replace them.

In the end, both sides end up exactly as they started, believing that their side is correct, that the price of war was worth it, that war/resistance is justified, necessary, and indeed the only path forward. "

1fonxxk,Interesting announcment by Iran,2024-09-24 21:29:04,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fonxxk/interesting_announcment_by_iran/,"Israeli news desk N-12 reports that an Israeli professor Lior Stanfield was invited by the president of Iran Masud Pazshakhian to a ""meeting"" and claimed that Iran would like to ""improve relationship with the west"" and ""solve regional problems that caused pain and suffering and it must stop"". The unusual statement found Israeli factors surpprised even more when Pazshakhian added that ""the collective regional peace must include Israel as well"". 

Assuming the last 20 years events, Israel recieved the new statement with mixed feelings: Iran made almost anything it could to push Israel into distruction. At the other hand, the zig zag to a ""collective peace"" seems too sharp, suspicious and nonsense. 
What you guys think? Is Iran bloffing with another trick or it somehow got convinced at the last few months to change it's policy? 

Take in to account that Iran was involved in any reality shaping event during the last years, including the 7 october events, the war in Gaza, the war with Hizbulla in Lebanon and many additional micro events that leaded the region into an escalation. It also will forced to compete Saudi Arabia at the gas and oil markets whenever the Saudi pipe will built and suffer huge income lost due to the western ambargo. Till now, Iran used the russian pipes to indirectly sell gas to europe. Does Iran came into conclusion that Russia should be abandoned?

1fon277,Interview with Palestinian woman in Hebron mentions refusing a literal 'blank check' from (assuming Israel?) to leave her home. [True/False],2024-09-24 20:51:48,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fon277/interview_with_palestinian_woman_in_hebron/,"I'm not here to promote anything just simply trying to educate myself on the situation and understand the history of the Middle East.

1foi8za,Israel Should Revoke Draft Exceptions For Arabs,2024-09-24 17:32:24,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1foi8za/israel_should_revoke_draft_exceptions_for_arabs/,"Now, at first glance, this might read like a hot take (and admittedly, it probably is) but hear me out: I think Israel should very seriously consider revoking the draft exemption for Arab citizens. 

As it stands, around one in five Israeli is an Arab (and the number is likely to continue growing over time given the trends in birth rates). So, this would be a significant number of additional conscripts (and over time of additional reservists available). As recent events show, the country's enemies do not afford any special treatment to Arab Israelis: when Hamas crossed the fence, they abducted Arab Muslims just as they did Ashkenazi Jews; when Hezbollah fires their rockets, they go down on Arab neighborhoods all the same (although, to be fair to Hezbollah, I don't know how accurate I could shoot with one hand and scorched eyes). So, the defense of the country is inherently in the interest of the Arab citizenry, too. And I have not even mentioned yet, that they enjoy equal citizenship with all rights that entails. It would only be fair for them to share equally in the burdens.

Another point is that a higher share of Arab soldiers would go a long way in combatting some of the IDF's major shortcomings. Let's face it: as things stand, Israel will have to maintain the occupation of the Palestinian territories for quite a while before it will safely be possible to withdraw. That requires the presence of troops on the ground. For obvious reasons, there is massive resentment among the inhabitants of the occupied territories. Having Arab soldiers present would not only enable Israel to rotate out some of the more problematic units from the West Bank (thus removing a source of significant bad publicity and magnet for international scrutiny) it would also be an opportunity to foster a more cooperative attitude among the locals. Arab soldiers would add cultural competencies/soft skills in terms of dealing with the population in a manner that is understood as more respectful. Also, the mental bar would be lower for civilians to cooperate with a person who looks like them, speaks their language fluently and is not Jewish (which is kinda important, considering that most Palestinians learn from a young age that Jews are inherently bad people by nature). Arab soldiers would also be less likely to turn a blind eye to criminal acts committed by settlers against the local population and might be more likely to call out misbehavior, particularly mistreatment of local inhabitants, committed by other soldiers to the superior officers, thus improving overall discipline among the occupation forces. 

On a societal level, equal duties of service could also lead to less polarization along ethnic and religious lines. Every Israeli would effectively be forced to get to know their counterpart (and chances are that they encounter that their fellow countryman are actually not as different from themselves was they thought). Given that in a country such as Israel, the army is somewhat of an institution of ""territory education"", so mandatory service could positively impact the social and economic mobility of minority populations overall. 

There would, of course, be practical issues to sort out, such as introducing a uniform variant that accommodates or includes a hijab for female soldiers, providing halal food options on any base (which should not be very hard for an organization that has plenty experience with much more complicated kosher food) and probably many more little details I am currently missing. But that should be doable and the benefit would far outweigh the extra effort.

And to top it of, I will do you one better: it might even be worthwhile considering for a moment the idea of opening the IDF for (select) Palestinians. For ages, a ""right of return"" for Palestinians displaced from Israel during the Israeli War of Independence has been a contested hot-button issue. Long term, I could imagine offering such path - but not for free. Such Palestinians who can demonstrate that their direct ancestors lived on Israeli territory and where displaced (including by leaving at the suggestion of the invading Arab states) without engaging in (or abetting )hostilities of any kind against Israel, and, who can further proof to never have engaged in violent acts against Israel or been a member of a terrorist organization might be admitted into the IDF. It would be prudent to also require sufficient proficiency in Hebrew. After a certain period of unblemished service - off the cuff I would think about 10, maybe 15 years, so it represents a significant commitment - they would be granted Israeli citizenship and would be allowed to bring along spouses (as long as those meet the criteria regarding violent acts/memberships as stated above) and dependent children to live with them in Israel. Admittedly, I am not quite sure of the feasibility of this second idea, but I though I might as well just get it out there while at it. Chances are that someone smarter than me might have some thoughts (or - hopefully constructive -criticism) on the matter."

My question is why do  
Palestinians still believe they can win this war, kick out all the Jews and  
erase Israel from the Map? 

If you visit the official  
palestine sub, they really believe Hamas is winning this war and Hezbollah is  
going to kick Israels ass. In what world is losing 40k lives, your state turned  
to rubble, and almost all the leaders dead, considered a victory? How delusional  
can you be. India lost a chunk of land to China in the 1962 war (Aksai Chin).  
But we are not going to go to war against China anytime soon over that piece of  
land nor are we going to boycott Chinese products or stop trade with them.  
Because we know that going to War with China is stupid and we are not  
delusional in thinking that we can defeat China even though we have Nuclear  
Weapons ourselves. 

To quote the meme,  
""One does not simply erase a Nuclear armed country from the map""

To Palestinians, please  
follow the path of peace and try to find another way to get your state  
diplomatically and not militarily. The more force you use, the more land you'll  
lose. If you don‚Äôt stop going to war against Israel, in the next 50-100 years, there will be no more West Bank or Gaza.

The slog of the 1980s ending in 2000 is a distant memory. 2006 I can remember more vividly with the suprise attack on Israeli troops by Hezbollah. A month long war ensued, leading to widespread destruction across Lebanon, the South and Beirut.

The IDF went in, and fought a much more well organised force, using modern weaponry and tactics. The IAF alone was not able to stop the daily rocket attacks and eventually, nor was the ground offensive. It ended in stalemate and withdrawal, and eventually led to Ehud Olmert's resignation, the final death blow for the left in Israel.

So what  happens now? Is Israel just deciding to make use of the current situation to cut Hezbollah down to size, after its been growing over 20 years? And if so, what would the end of this look like if the rockets keep flying? Is the calculation to put enough pressure on Hezbollah, via backroom dealings between Iran and the US, that they relent?

Ultimately, this is a situation where  I do have sympathy for the Lebanese civilians that are going to get caught in the crossfire, especially in such a divided society, in a failing state, where the decision of war is being made by a sectarian group funded from the outside.

This sucks, whichever way you look at it.

Americans are absolutely clueless on Israel-Palestinian conflict. Empty vessels make the most noise. They dont know enough about the conflict, but that sure as h**** not going to hinder them exercising their first amendment rights, hence making them the noisiest.

What the h*** happened ? Have Americans been living in a cave for the past 70 years ? How on earth could someone not know about Israel and Palestine before October 7th ? It is one of the oldest conflict that is still ongoing. Were they just born yesterday ? Have they been spending their time following the Kardashians all these time ? I would forgive the North Koreans for not knowing about the Israel-Palestinian conflict, they probably didnt have access to world news. I would forgive the Chinese for not fully understanding the Israel-Palestinian conflict, living behind the Great Fire Wall, they just see what the Chinese government wants them to see. But Americas, at least they are free, nobody is stopping any Americans from heading to their local library and borrowing a book to read about this conflict or researching about this conflict. 

Americans werent like that in the past, there were many really smart and brilliant Americans. They used to be very interested in learning and many were leaders and pioneers in their fields. Where is the critical thinking ? Have they even read a book on this conflict or are they just watching tiktok ? But now, I dont know anymore, it kinda lost its edge. 

It felt like this Are you smarter than a 5th Grader question https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8pnec4Hxps

Initially, I thought it was the public school system in USA was the failure. It‚Äôs only the poorer Americans who went to public schools who arent that bright that are clueless. Then the Colombia University campus protest happened, and other Ivy leagues campuses joined in‚Ä¶.these are supposed to be the brightest and smartest American students. Even the smartest Americans students appear clueless,‚Ä¶.

1. Were you surprised the Americans are so clueless on this 70 years+ Israel-Palestinian conflict ? 

2. Were you disappointed in how Americans reacted ? 

3. What do you think of American Jews ? They seem equally clueless on the history of Israel. Does it surprise you American Jews dont understand Israel ? There are even American Jews who actively join the protest movement. I am not talking about those American Jews with funny hats, the more secular American Jews but equally clueless. 

P/s: i use the word clueless but i think another way to describe it is parallel world (they appear to live in different dimension world where historical events were different to our common understanding). Or an upside down world I guess, where they would defend Hamas or defend Hezbollah, both terrorist organizations according to the US government.

The UAE‚Äôs foreign envoy wrote an op-ed which can be found here: (paywall)
https://www.ft.com/content/cfef2157-a476-4350-a287-190b25e45159

Some key points:

* 		Nusseibeh advocated for deploying a temporary international mission to Gaza. She said this mission would respond to the humanitarian crisis, establish law and order, and lay the groundwork for governance. 
* 		The UAE would be ready to be part of such an international force and would put boots on the ground.
* 		The international force would have to enter Gaza at the formal invitation of the Palestinian Authority. 
* 		The Palestinian Authority would have to conduct meaningful reforms and be led by a new prime minister who is empowered and independent. 
* 		The Israeli government would need to allow the Palestinian Authority to have a role in governing Gaza and agree to a political process based on the two-state solution.
* 		The U.S. would have a leadership role in any ""day-after"" initiative.

The current proposal for Gaza's ""day after"" raises several significant concerns, especially when considering the region's complexities.

The UAE's suggestion of deploying an international mission, backed by humanitarian and governance goals, sounds like a necessary step. However, some critical issues need to be addressed:

1. Security Guarantees for the International Mission: Any force deployed to stabilize Gaza would need strong security assurances. With the remnants of terror networks, criminal groups, and the likelihood of extremist elements regrouping, how can we guarantee the safety of international personnel? This is especially important if hostilities continue, or if rogue factions, possibly linked to Hamas or other militant groups, see the mission as an occupying force.

2. Palestinian Authority's Capability and Reform: The Palestinian Authority (PA) has long struggled with issues of corruption and inefficiency. The ""pay-to-slay"" policy, which financially rewards those who carry out acts of violence against Israelis, is just one example of how the PA is far from implementing ""meaningful reforms."" Even if there‚Äôs international pressure, what happens if the PA refuses to let in a humanitarian mission? Will this lead to a further power vacuum or empower alternative groups, even extremist ones, like Hamas 2.0?

3. U.S. Involvement without Boots on the Ground: While the U.S. might play a consultation role, it has shown reluctance to place troops in the region. Consulting and training from afar may not be enough to enforce stability. So who leads the initiative on the ground? If it's an Arab-led force, how will those nations ensure they're not seen as betraying their fellow Muslims by cooperating with Israel?

4. The Philadelphi Corridor and Egypt's Role: The porous border between Gaza and Egypt has been a long-standing issue. Egypt‚Äôs negligence or complicity in allowing weapons and resources to flow into Gaza cannot be overlooked. What‚Äôs to stop new militants, weapons and supplies from again coming through the same channels, reinforcing terrorist groups and undermining any international mission?

5. Israel's Deterrence and Security Needs: Any day-after plan must ensure that Israel feels secure and that its citizens aren't under the constant threat of rocket attacks or terrorist incursions. How does Israel establish deterrence to prevent a resurgence of militant groups, especially in a scenario where international forces might limit its military operations?

The plan has a lot of idealistic elements, but the realities on the ground suggest it needs to address these key points to have any chance of success. Without addressing them, we risk recreating the same conditions that led to Gaza becoming a base for terrorism in the first place.

you can't really 'blame the jews' as a form of making up for past sins despite one of those same sins being 'blaming the jews' on everything. am I the only one who finds the left growing more and more racist towards the jewish people? if so, isn't it good that israel exist? now, despite all of the descrimination and potential racism, our people actually have a home to go to in case shit hits the fan. they're literally being the cause for the exact same reason israel was founded for. in 1948, right after the holocaust. then they want israel to stop existing. isn't that a little too convinient?"

Therefore, because the UN has not waived immunity in this case, its subsidiary, UNRWA, retains full immunity, and the lawsuit against UNRWA should be dismissed due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction.""

Many Israelis try to do ""hasbara"" (explanation).
In this process we are trying to provide a counter with the small number that we are, to the aggressive arab and Palestinian propaganda that has been going on for years.

I noticed that there is something common to almost all the posts written by Israelis on the net,
They are formulated in a gentle and apologetic manner that suits people who lived in exile for most of history in countries where the majority are not Jewish.

Let me explain how I see the situation.

Jews lived most of their history in exile mainly in Muslim and Christian countries where they were persecuted for being Jews.
whether you like it or not but history is factual, there is no country the Jews lived in where they were not murdered and persecuted just for being Jews with the exception of India.

The fact that we had to live closed in our communities make us developed some attributes in our collective personality.

One of them is that Israel is trying to explain to the world in an apologetic way that we have the right to defend ourselves when they try to kill us
While we are trying to make comparisons between wars waged by the Western world with ISIS for example.

""Yes, maybe it's okay that innocent people get hurt because of course you, the people of the Western free world, with your pure soul, also had to take the lives of innocent people to keep your people from danger, war is war and innocent people get hurt during it, Jews did not invent this phenomenon"" 
It's just an apologetically disgusting narrative to me.

So now I will present you with a slightly less apologetic narrative and if we have already started the tradition of comparing us to the behavior of Muslims and Christians throughout history, then I will not break the tradition.

The main difference I see between Muslims and Christians and Jews is that Judaism is not an open religion that wants you to be Jewish like Christians and Muslims want you to join their religion.

And so the Christians spread their religion aggressively through crusades, and the Muslims also did it with many conquests throughout histore.

You know who didn't try to aggressively spread their religion throughout history? 
True, Tibetans, but who else? 
The Maori, you are right, but why is it so hard for you to say that the Jews didn't try to turn you into Jews? 

oh right... 
Antisemitism is the oldest form of evil in this world.
On campuses in the western world you can find words like colonialism, genocide and apartheid being shouted loudly.

These voices are heard by young people who are probably very ashamed of the fact that their fathers are responsible for the creation of these concepts, and do not realize that they are continuing the path of their fathers by attributing these concepts to the Jews now.

This is antisemitism.

The funny part is that they are aware that in order to do these terrible things your profile has to be a white person from the West so they tell themselves that Jews are white people who only came from Europe, the fact is that I am a Jew whose ancestors lived in India throughout the years and color my skin is brown, find it really funny.

The next time you want to protest about behaviors you really don't agree with, look in your parents, grandparents and grandmothers eyes and ask hard questions about Christianity and Islam in their time.

And don't drop what's yours on us because you can't face the fact that you did it, and well... we don't.

So no, I'm not going to argue with you about whether the Jews have the right to defend themselves because there is some fact from 876 that justifies our being in this land.

I'm just going to say that Jews have a right to defend themselves because Jews have a right to defend themselves.

When it was in your hands you failed to protect us, we swore never again, and it doesn't matter if you're not happy with us doing it."

Do you think the figures coming out of Gaza are mistaken? That nowhere near as many innocents are being killed? Okay that‚Äôs a separate issue. 

Now for those who believe the numbers of thousands of innocents being dismembered in the name of a fraction of a fraction of hostages‚Ä¶.would it be the same if it were like Ukraine and Russia? What if a Ukrainian militant group, sick of the occupation of Crimea launched a civilian raid (I do think that‚Äôs immoral no matter what) and killed a thousand Russians. Even kidnapped some. Are you telling me that would completely flip your view on the conflict? On the countless thousands Ukrainians dying and losing their homes? 

The smoking Ukrainian hospitals you saw with charred limbs, would you look at them and cheer for Russia? I know most of you would not. And the death toll in Ukraine is lower than Gaza. In a shorter time. Ukraine is even an actual independent state with a professional military. 

I‚Äôm not even getting into the history. Let‚Äôs assume the Gaza Strip was a completely independent and happy strip of land who had no reason to hate Israel. (Comical ik). One day, a terrorist organisation from this land comes and does Oct7. A state should never be allowed to do what Israel is doing in retaliation. I don‚Äôt get it. Are Israelis just worth more than Palestinians (yes)? Otherwise how could you guys have such a visceral reaction to the innocents killed on oct 7; but be so desensitised to equally innocent people being killed in MAGNITUDES higher numbers? Again. Answer my Ukraine and Russia question plz. Don‚Äôt avoid it. Nothing else really matters if I can‚Äôt even see what you think when the sympathies are reversed. 

Is that allowed to happen in Europe? Can Germany exterminate as many polish citizens it seems neccassary if Poland causes even a dent to its society? (Israel made Oct 7 look like a dent in comparison to its retaliation, not me) "

How funny it is to start talking about apartheid, people who obviously do not know what apartheid is.

Apartheid, by definition, is something that a government enforces against ITS OWN CITIZENS. Palestinians ARE NOT citizens of Israel. Therefore, apartheid CANNOT exist. Believing that this is the case is as foolish as believing that the Americans apply apartheid to Mexicans.

Let‚Äôs start with the basics, which is the definition of apartheid, a phenomenon that only occurs within ONE COUNTRY.

Why did I put emphasis on ‚Äúone country‚Äù? Because apartheid consists of a government that, in its own country, segregates a group of the population and governs it under a legal regime different from that of the rest. Yes, it is a pleonasm to speak of ‚Äúa government in its own country‚Äù, but...

That is where ""International Court"" and Palestinian propaganda fail. His entire accusation against Israel for apartheid is based on the reality experienced by millions of Palestinians WHO DO NOT LIVE IN ISRAEL. That is, they live outside that country.

By definition, Israel could only impose an apartheid regime against a minority living WITHIN ISRAEL. That is, citizens with Israeli nationality. Like the nearly 2 million Israeli Arabs. But they live under the same laws as Jews, so...

It is not because of the Israeli Arabs that Israel can be accused of exercising apartheid. Is there any group in Israel that lives under a different and discriminatory legal framework? No. In Israel, all Israelis live under the same law. Jews, Arabs and others.

Those who live under a different legal framework are the Palestinians who are governed by Hamas in Gaza, or by the Palestinian National Authority in the West Bank. But they live under a different legal framework because they are not Israelis and do not live in Israel. As simple as that.

International court‚Äòs position is idiotic. It amounts to demanding that Palestinians who are not Israelis and do not live in Israel receive the same rights from the State of Israel as Israelis. It does not take two brain cells to understand that this is nonsense.

Can you imagine if I accused the United States of exercising apartheid against Mexicans who live in Mexico, claiming that they do not give us the same rights as American citizens? It is an irrationality that does not even deserve discussion.

However, you falls into the Judeophobic behavior of demanding from Israel what is not demanded from any other country. That is, that it grant full rights to people who do not have Israeli citizenship, and who do not live in the territory of Israel.

People who are not interested in rigorous analysis, but rather in attacking Israel. Anti-Semitism, in its most vulgar version.

Israel does not have to give citizenship rights to anyone who is not a citizen of Israel. Nor residency rights to anyone who does not reside in Israel (even if they are not a citizen). In other words, no country has to do that.

To foolish words, deaf ears."
1fmjci7,New PCPR poll data shows that Palestinian support for 10/7 has hit an all time low.,2024-09-22 02:43:39,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fmjci7/new_pcpr_poll_data_shows_that_palestinian_support/,"New PCPR poll data shows that Palestinian support for 10/7 has hit an all time low.

Screenshot: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GYCwaFtW4AAyFcn?format=jpg&name=large

PCPR is a Palestinian organization that has polled the West Bank and Gaza for decades. They are considered the most reliable source of survey data in the territories.

In addition, support for Hamas, Iran, and Sinwar in the war are at all time lows in the Gaza Strip, and approval of the US involvement in the war is at an all time high.

Full survey: https://t.co/frWPXjjAkP

There is a huge split between Gaza and the West Bank, where Gaza's approval of Hamas and armed resistance has plummeted, while the West Bank has been more steady in its support for armed resistance.

""We presented the public with three ways to end the Israeli occupation and establish an independent Palestinian state and asked them to choose the most effective one: 

- 48% (50% in the West Bank and 36% in the Gaza Strip) chose ""armed struggle""; 

- 30% (24% in the West Bank and 40% in the Gaza Strip) chose negotiations; 

- and 15% (11% in the West Bank and 
22% in the Gaza Strip) chose popular peaceful resistance. 

As shown in the figure below, these results indicate a decrease of 6 percentage points in support for armed struggle, a 5 percentage point increase in support for negotiations, and a decrease of one percentage point 
in support for peaceful resistance. The drop in support for armed struggle comes from the Gaza Strip, where this percentage drops by 20 points.""

This suggests a few things:

1) The Israeli military campaign is not radicalizing the population - Gaza, which has received the blunt of it, now is more supportive of negotiation and less supportive of armed resistance and terror tactics than before. 

2) There is beginning to be real support in the Gaza strip for less extreme leadership, the poll explicitly shows other more moderate options getting higher support for the first time."
1fmgrel,Senator Hawley grills anti semite in a hearing and further illustrates that the pro Palestinian movements in their current form are Jewish hate groups,2024-09-22 00:17:04,68,https://youtu.be/tn0nCVfxdBs?si=N7X5B4WpLvWGXugu,"Just a few days ago, Senator Hawley questioned Maya Berry, the executive director of the American Arab Institute, about her views towards obvious hates speech on college campuses. 

He pulled out photos of very specific written statements pro Palestinians protesters made that were clearly anti semitic, and Ms. Berry, again displayed how intentional these groups are in disguising their hate and illiberal values as ‚Äúhuman rights.‚Äù   He gave examples of calling for ‚ÄúIntifada‚Äù or ‚Äúthere is only one solution‚Äù, and anti Semite Berry had difficulty condemning these statements that were explicit calls for violence against Jews.  Instead she condemned ‚Äúviolence‚Äù. 

If Jews marched down the street and held signs that said ‚ÄúFrom the River to the Sea, Israel will be Free‚Äù those statements would also (rightfully) be interpreted as hate speech.  However, according Arabs, it‚Äôs ok to say that ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù should be free from Jews. 

What we have here is a not very good or effective gaslighting because it‚Äôs so obvious what these statements mean.  Jew haters argue why it‚Äôs not anti semitic knowing that it is as a way to legitimize it. 

Here‚Äôs what needs to happen: Groups such as the American Arab Institute, CAIR and other American groups who espouse this type of rhetoric should be classified as domestic terrorist organizations that provide political support to Muslim Brotherhood foreign terrorist organizations such as Hamas, al Qaeda, etc as well as Iranian state sponsored jihadist organizations. 

Pro-terrorist detractors on this sub are going to argue that there is nuance to these statements.  There isn‚Äôt. If they wanted a peaceful resolution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, they‚Äôd argue it.  But they ONLY argue for violence, but in language that gives them plausible deniability. "
1fmeqxm,"On morality, culture, knowledge (or lack of) and the meta age.",2024-09-21 22:34:21,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fmeqxm/on_morality_culture_knowledge_or_lack_of_and_the/,"I am not going to get into specific incidents here, because scrolling this channel will give enough of those. 

Morality and culture are always intertwined with one another, even those who do not agree with the idea of moral relativism (believe that there is only one correct way of morality) will have to admit it exists.

There are 2 main types of social/moral cultures.
Guilt culture and shame culture.
The main difference between the 2 is the ability to repent ones errors.

guilt culture uses punishments for repentance, trying to correct those who stray from the correct path.

shame culture does not grant any forgiveness, once a wrong has been done, it is unfixable, the shame sticks to the wrongdoer and may never be lifted, he is shunned and exiled from society, and even excommunicated from his family to lessen their relation to the wrong doer.

I will say that modern western civilizations tend to have guilt cultures and arab civilizations tend to have more of a shame culture.

Israeli culture is mainly a guilt culture, while palestinian culture is mainly a shame culture.
I do write mainly because I am sure there are exceptions in both cultures. 

What is scary, is that todays technology makes it seem as we all live in a global village, you can sit on one side of the globe, and see what's happening on the other side of the world.

With information spreading faster than ever, cancel culture was born in the west, cancel culture is a very modern form of a shame culture.

Information spreading online and on the newa rarely shows an objective truth, and it is more than often impossible to reach the truth through them.

How many of the people debating here are actually in israel/palestine?

I have spent the last three months in the area, been to gaza, the west bank, Jerusalem, Haifa, Tel aviv, Jaffa And the Galilee, and I can say by reading comments here that most people have no idea what is actually happening in gaza, the west bank, or any Israeli territory.

It is terrifying to see how many people selectively belive what they hear from one side, and canceling the other one, over an issue they know nothing about. 

It is easy to judge people from the comfort of your phones, seeing the news and deciding what is clearly right and what is clearly wrong, but in reality - things are much more complicated than they look to you on the video you saw on Tiktok, Instagram or youtube.

I can say this
I saw a lot of fire and a lot of blood, I saw fear in the eyes of people. I saw fanaticism but also saw comradery and compassion.
With that said I think I understand both sides a little better now, and yet even after seeing what's going on there I cant say I fully know what is right.

It is easy to call for peace when you have never felt the fear of war. It is also easy to call one side evil and disregarding its suffering. 

Anyway, for many people here all palestinians are evil and for many people here Israel has no right to exist - and I'm kind of tired of reading this line of thougt, cuz I don't know where the line of morality crosses, but I do know the edges of this line are not moral, and I surely know that people who have nothing to do with this controversial topic deciding what's right and what's wrong is definitly wrong.

The first one was with Jonathan Cornicus, a reservist lieutenant Colonel who is a spokesperson for the IDF. The interview was very moderate, Jonathan answered the questions he was asked and directly explained Israel‚Äôs position, openly admitted that he believed the attacks on Hezbollah devices was Israel (he could easily have denied it since Israel has not admitted it) and explained that all Israel wants is to return the thousands of Israelis displaced from the north back home. That‚Äôs it. 

 
Today I was discussing the video with family, but when I tried to open the video, I saw it had been removed by YouTube for ‚Äúviolating youtube terms and conditions‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt know all of the terms and conditions YouTube has, but I watched another BBC interview from the same day discussing Nasrallahs speech, and that video was still up there. 

In that interview, Jonathan said nothing about his feeling about the war, did not insight hatred or anything considered racial against Palestinians. He was respectful and spoke to the point. And his interview was deleted. 

Another YouTuber and Israeli tour guide Oren created a video explaining that his videos that are just historical based explanations are being rated 18+ on YouTube and are therefore killing his views. 

So it‚Äôs making me wonder what is going on on YouTube that makes pro Israeli content be deleted or censored? Is pro Palestinian content getting the same treatment? Or maybe is it just moderate content on both sides? Because extremist content is what brings views? Am I just being paranoid? 

It just really concerned me that that video was deleted, because it makes me wonder how much of our information is being censored in order to keep this conflict going. "

Hizbollah claims to be the ‚Äúdefender of Lebanon‚Äù - from what? Israel has zero interest in taking over Lebanon and controlling it.

Let us not forget the simple fact - Hizbollah is a terror group per se, with the only purpose of serving as an Iranian proxy to deter Israel from attacking its nuclear sites. 


Unfortunately for the poor Lebanese people (which I wholeheartedly wish them to be safe), After 11 months of warnings and de-escalation attempts, Hizbollah going to get Lebanon burnt down to ashes.

Has anyone else's Mental health seemed to have taken a turn for the worst after everything that's been happening?

I know what a baby's body looks like after being bombed.

I saw the limbs of children lying on the streets and caught in the limbs of trees after they were hit by an airstrike .

The sounds of mothers screaming over the bodies of their children still haunt me. As a mother myself, I cannot comprehend the pain, and I cannot understand how someone can do this much less defend it. 

I know, I cannot be the only one who has been traumatized by everything .

I have been following Motaz Azaiza, Bisan Owda and Hind Khoudary. These are all legitimate sources and they all three have been nominated for the Nobel peace prize.
It also blows my mind that for decades, the world thought that Israel were the good guys , and Palestine was always the enemy, but now the world knows the truth. Israel has been the enemy all along ever since The Nakba of 1948 they have been abusing and oppressing and killing and taking hostage Palestinians, including children.

And before anyone brings up October 7, Israel has been caught on film killing Palestinian children long before last year. For example Faris Odeh. The last photo of him ever seen alive can still be seen seconds before he was killed.

People who support Israel can no longer say this is self-defense. It's time to wake up and see the situation for what it is and that is genocide.

I'm not a Palestinian. I do not live in the Middle East. I had zero knowledge of the history between Israel and Palestine before last year and then I did my own independent research. I was absolutely shocked and heartbroken and have been ever since.

And so given common Palestine supporters claims: israel is based on colonising the land of the indegious people already living there and Israel is commiting war crimes in a war against a muslim country.

Wouldn't America be just as bad and undeserving of existing as israel? if not worse given israel did have the famous september 47 vote where the UN decided jews had the right to make a jewish country in the land that is currently israel/palestine.

So american palestine supporters what is your solution to this? Do you belive america also has no right to exist or is there a reason that America is better/different then israel that gives it the right to exist because Im not seeing too many anti america protests.

This post is not here to argue im here to gain insight and prespective into this ""flaw In logic"" that popped up in my head a while ago and understand the other side a little better. and maybe give some prespective and insight back.

Also this post is not here to ask if israel should exist as im sure there are enough posts on the sub about this it is asking if for the sake of the argument we accept israel shouldn't exist would that make america also have no right to exist.

* **879 people killed in explosions so far**
* **Of the dead, 131 were Iranians and 79 were Yemenis, the rest were Lebanese**
* **291 of the dead were officers**
* **In the explosions, 491 were completely blinded and 602 were seriously injured**
* **905 completely lost their genitalia and 1735 suffered serious damage (the search device was generally kept in a belt pouch.**

**The target of the radiotelephone attack was Hezbollah‚Äôs elite unit Radwan. Radwan carries out special operations for Hezbollah and its strength is about 2,500 fighters. The unit‚Äôs primary mission is to infiltrate Israeli territory and capture civilian communities in the Galilee region. Radwa‚Äôs commandos operate in small groups and, according to Hezbollah, carry out ambushes, assassinations or operations that require infiltration deep into Israel. Radwan uses highly mobile units as means of transportation: motorcycles, ATVs and light all-terrain vehicles equipped with Russian-made Kornet ATGMs (anti-tank missiles).**

**Despite UN Resolution 1701, which calls for Hezbollah to withdraw its forces north of the Litani River, Radwan forces are still stationed on the Blue Line ‚Äì a border monitored by UN peacekeepers ‚Äì conducting surveillance and intelligence gathering in northern Israel.After the blasts on the communication devices, Hezbollah now has thousands of disabled leaders and fighters and hospitals are full of wounded. Hezbollah‚Äôs ability to wage war has also decreased due to the fact that it cannot rely on its means of communication. Israel now has a good opportunity to clear Hizbullah from the security zone being formed in Lebanon between the Litani River and the border. In the future, the zone in question can be controlled by the forces of the Lebanese army with the support of the UN.**"
1flh680,Events in Lebanon this week: Israel is back,2024-09-20 17:10:57,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1flh680/events_in_lebanon_this_week_israel_is_back/,"So much to mention.

**Tuesday:** The news came that a number of pagers had exploded. Then that it was hundreds across Lebanon, all held by members of Hezbollah and those affiliated with them, including the Iranian ambassador in the country.

Reports said these pagers would beep, causing the users to check them, right before they self-destructed.

News claimed that this was possibly done because Israel's plan was about to be uncovered and this would have been their last chance to use it. Haaretz and the BBC said it was a success that was possibly masking a strategic failure. A one-off obviously

**Wednesday:** During one of the gatherings accompanying a funeral of one of those killed the previous day, a communication device exploded... Then shortly thereafter, reports from all across the country that hundreds, maybe more of walkie talkies had ALSO self-destructed, killing dozens more of Hezbollah members.

**Thursday:** A speech by Nasrallah came trying to dampen the rumours that this had deeply affected the organisation, and that these attacks had ""violated all red lines"". Red lines that apparently no one had agreed to over the 11 months of attacks by Hezbollah on Israeli held territory in solidarity with Hamas and Gaza after Oct. 7th......

Retaliation promised, the usual.

**TODAY:** Israel fired at several missile launchers in the South of Lebanon. Hezbollah responded by firing a large salvo at the north of Israel in retaliation, a large part of which was intercepted by the Iron Dome.

The response by Israel then if it could be put in one sentence would be: ""You want to play?""

[https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cwyl9048gx8t](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cwyl9048gx8t)

Reports shortly arrived of a major airstrike on the Dahieh area of Southern Beirut. As the smoke cleared, the announcement came that a (another rather) senior Hezbollah commander had been killed, Hezbollah's operations commander Ibrahim Aqil, wanted by the Americans for involvement in the 1983 bombing of the US marines barracks in Beirut. On a list of wanted terrorists for a while, see [here](https://www.state.gov/executive-order-13224/)

It seems very clear to me, after the Oct 7th disaster, that Israel has been trying to send the message that it is getting its intelligence and military capabilities back in order. If this week is any indication, then it certainly has. This is among the most devastating series of blows Israel has ever dished out to an opponent in such a short time, maybe any side has in modern history, especially against a non-state militant group.

So what now? Israel clearly has turned its attention to the north after patiently waiting it out and taking the hits from Hezbollah. A large number of its military resources and manpower have been there for at least the last 10 months... Are we going towards an all out conflict to push Hezbollah back?"
1fl7ymz,Three State Solution Possibility ,2024-09-20 09:30:53,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fl7ymz/three_state_solution_possibility/,"I'm Lebanese and I was recently thinking about this the other day when I was watching videos on why the Two State Solution would not work so hear me out:

State 1: the land of Israel (excluding West Bank and Gaza) that is run as it is right now with Jewish-oriented legislation and government officials). The government would have to be reformed to prevent discrimination of Arabs and non-Jews and allow for Arabs to enjoy the same rights as other Israeli citizens. The capital would could be Tel Aviv.

State 2: the land of Gaza that is run by a more pro-Islamic government (that is willing to seek peace I would hope) and can run on Sharia law or have more Muslim oriented legislation like how Israel does for Jews. Israeli settlement would be permitted once said and done and all citizens would hold equal rights. Capital would be Gaza City

State 3: West Bank that is run by Jews, Muslims, and Christians who all have a say in government and has more sectarian legislation that does not put one religion over the other. Capital would be Jerusalem. This way, no religion dominates the holy city.

All three states can be part of either a confederation that all works together or just separate states entirely to prevent conflict in government.

It probably won't work at the moment since both sides hate each other to death (literally) but I would like to know from fellow Israelis/Palestinians on why exactly it would not work.

Also Golan Heights and Sheba'a farms would be returned to Syria and Lebanon, respectively. Other Arab countries in the region would allow for normalization as a result 

However the biggest factor that is stopping an idea like this or something similar is increasing radicalization on both sides which is getting worse as the war continues on. What do you think of this idea and why can and can it not work?

EDIT: Thank you for all the open ideas and discussions. Please correct me on anything since each news source I learn from has some sort of bias to one particular side and I would love to know the real situation. From what I have learned it would make much more sense to just make the Golan Heights Israeli territory because of the current instability of Syria and widespread opinion amongst the Syrians and Israelis who live there."
1fl78g1,The question of anti-Semitism when discussing Israel and Palestine from the POV of someone living in Asia ,2024-09-20 08:34:16,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fl78g1/the_question_of_antisemitism_when_discussing/,"
Throwaway account for obvious reasons, looking for genuine engagement and answers.

This is not targeted at everyone and I do not speak for everyone in Asia (it is a huge and multifaceted region), but I‚Äôm from a region of Asia that has gone through its fair share of massacres and genocides in our histories. Of course, we haven‚Äôt all lost our homeland the way the Jewish people have, although indigenous communities have become marginal to many lands through huge waves of colonisation, settler colonialism, and wars. We‚Äôve had mass refugee migrations, ‚Äúwith some 16.9 million refugees, internally displaced persons and stateless people as of the end of 2023.‚Äù Other brief stats: millions of Cambodians died during the genocide in the 70s (25% of the population), millions of Chinese, Koreans, Singaporeans, Filipinos and more were murdered by Japanese during WWII. The region has seen barbaric acts of eugenicist medical experimentation like those we read about in Nazi camps. 

What I‚Äôm saying is (I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a better way to phrase this, but please forgive my use of this term) that there is no exceptionalism involved in how we view what the Nazis did. Yes, it was horrific and brutal, but so has our histories been here, both in the past and even ongoing. I‚Äôm not trying to ‚Äúcompare‚Äù trauma, but my question in light of this context is: why do pro-Israel supporters call people in Asia anti-Semitic if we do not support Israel, when we don‚Äôt possess a history or context for that hostility against the Jewish people? Before all of this, I would say that the attitude was dominantly indifference. The way you don‚Äôt probably think of people from Thailand or Myanmar all the time, or even Taoist / Buddhist people - most of us spent our lives barely thinking about Israel, outside of learning about the persecution of the Jewish people in history. Sure, there‚Äôs a sizeable portion of Muslim people in Southeast Asia, for example, but the conflict between Israel and Palestine is the core source of any negative feelings currently, as opposed to a spiritual or historical mandate against the Jewish people. The religion did not become significant here until the 12th century, and any antisemitic slant in the theology was only introduced in the 1930s. (Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong here.) Amongst most people I know in the region, however, this is by no means a dominant tenet of the religion. I‚Äôm sure it exists in some factions, the way other extreme beliefs exist in every other religion. Even then, Islam is not the dominant religion in the region. I can only broadly say that I am from East/Southeast Asia, so you can likely guess. Furthermore, Christian churches in the region are extremely pro-Israel, with pilgrimages being a big part of their history, so we are extremely separate from the historical and theological roots of the issue. I grew up Christian and became agnostic. The church I went to even taught Hebrew. However, in no way was any of it ever linked to Jewishness when I grew up within it. It was just bible study, the way all of this was framed. 

When we give an opinion on the issue that leans towards supporting Palestine/when we say we are against Zionism in its current state, it‚Äôs almost like we are being accused of antisemitism without Jews? I can even understand if the accusation is that we don‚Äôt know enough, but it often jumps straight to that instead. Even scholars who study the region from the most neutral possible stance are not spared this accusation. Jewish presence in the region, especially Southeast Asia, is marginal at best. My country personally has many diplomatic ties with Israel. I‚Äôve had many good conversations with other people in the region, but when I engage with other people from Europe/US, I find that it boils down to this framing of the world that makes little contextual sense for anybody with my background or from my part of the world. I can‚Äôt confess to know everything about the conflict. I have tried to read as much as I can, and a very brief description of my beliefs are as follows: I believe in the right to self-determination. I know the region is a complicated one for that path to be simple, but that is weaved into a global power dynamic that has seeded these tragedies in the first place. I think terrorism is a problem that needs to be dealt with. But I also think Israel is a reactive state that plays the same tricks, with state backing and better equipment. While I understand the reasons for its defensiveness, I think a good leader needs to be able to rise to the occasion and make a better decision that involves grace and conviction. I do not think Israel has a leader like that, a leader who prioritises peace and can cut through the fear to make difficult and unpopular decisions - which would involve making concessions and stopping all settler expansion. I believe land should be given back. How much? That‚Äôs not for me to decide, but for Israel to propose and for the two states to discuss. I have my personal stance on the issue that leans left, but this belief is not even because of that. I am in fact pulling back on some of my personal convictions in this war because of the cards being dealt and because I understand intimately that people who are oppressed (or feel oppressed, some of you might think) will react in any way to fight for their freedom. No matter what frame is being used. It is human. If the other party cannot do it, the remaining one must, whether that is Israel or Palestine. And Israel has the privilege to make harder decisions because they are in power. Both sides see themselves as hostages. To a limited extent I agree. But Israel is in the position of power and they are continuing to escalate the violence. To me, that is an unalienable reality, no matter how much I understand their motivations historically or geopolitically. Whataboutism is pointless to me here, especially for the side that wants to wrestle for moral superiority. Violence cannot be seen as a ‚Äúhuman reaction‚Äù on one side but barbarism on the other. One cannot have the cake and eat it too. I say this for everyone involved, but especially Israel, simply because of how it is trying to frame the issue on the global stage and through its own domestic messaging.  In all fronts, I make sure that I direct my criticism to the state/those in power/ideologies (Israel/Hamas/Zionism/Fundamentalism) as opposed to citizens or ethnicities (Palestinians/Israelis/Jews/Muslims). 

Is there a way for me to discuss this without being accused of anti-Semitism? 

I‚Äôve had long conversations about this, sometimes more tactfully and sometimes not, depending on who I talk to and what context they arise from, the dominant question I am asked is to consider how Jewish people might feel, how their histories have shaped their reactions today. Not Israelis, but the Jewish people - though I understand them to mean  Zionists, since views on this are varied even for Jewish communities. And I have. I also have considered how Palestinians feel. But this is where my context comes into play again: of every genocide and massacre I know of in my region and beyond, the tragedy that the Jewish people went through over and over is the most known, most empathised with, and most recognised as horrific. I have learned more about it than the wars in my own region. I learned how many Jews died in WWII before I knew how many of those in my neighbouring countries died when the Japanese invaded during the same period. As gently as possible, as a Jewish person, do you feel that your history of suffering has not been recognised or acknowledged in the world? Or is not being taken into account in these conversations? Empathy is not finite. It is not that I have less to give because I have an intimate experience of genocides in my own region. But there is a web of global realities in my head and there is no central node, the way anti-Semitism is the central node of discrimination to the people I‚Äôve spoken to. This is not a problem if it merely frames how they want to view the world - my struggle comes when they not only expect me to frame it as a central node in the way I view the issue, but interpret our different positions (and therefore my opinions) through that frame. This is a position I struggle to understand, and would want to understand more. How can we approach each other to talk when we have these differing global realities in our heads? What can I do better so we can understand each other, or what do you feel you can concede? 

I apologise in advance if I said anything inaccurate or hurtful. I am hoping to learn how to discuss this better - and these are questions / positions I want to understand so I can understand better where you are coming from. I know this is not all of you, but for those who use the word ‚Äúanti-Semitism‚Äù to describe any pro-Palestine position, especially towards someone with limited historical context / almost no hostile histories with the Jewish people, please engage if you feel like you can. Thank you so much. "
1fl5zse,Serious Question: Why would you be against genocide? ,2024-09-20 06:58:05,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fl5zse/serious_question_why_would_you_be_against_genocide/,"This is a genuine question for supporters of Israel.

Many posts have been made on this subreddit arguing against the allegations of genocide that have been leveraged against Israel. Fine, simply for the sake of discussion, let's say I accept that what Israel is currently engaged in  regards to Gaza is not tantamount to genocide. 

My issue is that when I hear Palestinians discussed on this subreddit, it is almost always in terms of their complicity in the actions of Hamas and other militant groups, their violence, their antisemitism and how they pose an existential threat to not only Israelis, but often the whole of the Jewish people. I also hear rhetoric about how Palestinians ""do not exist"" and how Palestinian identity is a mere invention. Some would even argue that claiming Palestinian identity in and of itself is aligning one's self with terrorism. If I follow this logic to it's natural conclusion, I honestly don't understand how one could support anything other than an exterminationist position. I don't see how a two state solution could or even a continuing of the status quo could be seen as anything but a naive approach to an incredible danger. I'm not saying I accept this logic at all. I  absolutely don't. It just seems to me that if were to accept this logic, removing the Palestinians from the region, aside from the 20% that already reside in Israel and have citizenship, seems like the only viable solution to the conflict and I don't understand how you'd arrive at a different conclusion. So, if you believe those things, but arrived at a different conclusion, how exactly did you get there? 

All that said, I have to assume most of you think genocide is bad. Not only is that probably the least controversial statement one could ever make, but I don't think one would argue that Israel is not committing a genocide if one didn't think genocide is a bad thing to be accused of.

So here are my questions and they may seem silly but they are genuine and I will not argue with anyone who earnestly attempts to answer them: 

- If Israel isn't committing a genocide in Gaza, what are examples of specific actions Israel would have to take for you to recognize the military action in Gaza as genocide? You don't have to consider these actions likely. This is a hypothetical.

 
- If this were a genocide, would you actually care? Would you speak out against it? Would you join the protesters? Would you still regard them as misguided or even antisemitic? 


- If someone were to use genocidal rhetoric against Palestinians around you, how would you engage with them? What would be your argument to them as to why they are wrong?

- If the Palestinian people are such an existential threat to Israel, why is their forcible removal from the region not the solution? Try to avoid answers like ""it's just wrong"" and explain why it conflicts (or doesn‚Äôt conflict) with your system of morals.

-Is there any human cost in terms of Palestinian lives that you would consider too high for the benefit of Israeli security? If yes, be specific in terms of numbers. 

- Have I strawmanned your perspective of the Palestinian people? If so, how? What am I not considering?"
1fl2s1t,Anti-normalisation and Lebanese neighbours,2024-09-20 03:25:42,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fl2s1t/antinormalisation_and_lebanese_neighbours/,"Interesting to see many Lebanese people on social media and the actual media criticize Israel for their military actions as if Hezbollah was never firing on Israel since oct8. I'm curious to know how the lebanese people that actually know what is really going on get their information on the conflict and how they realize that Hezbollah is the instigator or if the anti-Israeli Lebanese people all know what really goes on but love to take a dump on Israel as usual. 

Lebanon is such a magnificent country and would benefit so much from an alliance with Israel so I wonder if anyone has any ins and outs on any normalization plans/efforts/possibilities since they are neighbour states and they both hate Hezbollah when you break everything down. 
Could Israel Help Lebanon break Iran's hand in Lebanese politics or are lebanese people collectively too far down the jewish hating rabbbit hole to realize that Israel is not a threat to Lebanon but actually one of the best potential allies they could have in a fight against Iranian dictatorial influence?

Shoot your theories please, since I know many lebanese people from all pieces of the puzzle and I'd like to know people's opinion on a possible peace between israel and lebanon from this sub. 

It's utopic, yes, but wishing is better than standing by and taking Hezbollah rockets, isnt it? "
1fl1suf,Are you concerned that Israel might nuke Iran to drag the U.S. into a war?,2024-09-20 02:32:19,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fl1suf/are_you_concerned_that_israel_might_nuke_iran_to/,"
I'm increasingly concerned about the geopolitical maneuvers involving Netanyahu and Trump. It seems Netanyahu is desperate to help Trump win reelection, particularly as he perceives Harris as an unreliable ally, despite her history of supporting Israel. The problem for Netanyahu is Iran and Hezbollah have been quite restrained. So I‚Äôm concerned that he might resort to dangerous measures. There‚Äôs a troubling possibility that Netanyahu might stage an attack‚Äîperhaps even using a nuclear weapon to strike a deserted area in Iran. If he were to do this, he could falsely claim that Iran tested a nuclear weapon, positioning it as a justification for military action against them.

Such a scenario would not only paint Iran as a nuclear threat but could also provoke a significant U.S. response, dragging the country into another war in the Middle East. Netanyahu might then attempt to shift blame onto Harris, leveraging public sentiment to rally support for Trump, which could bolster Trump's chances in the election. In return, Trump might feel pressured to allow further Israeli territorial expansion, such as the annexation of the West Bank, solidifying Netanyahu‚Äôs position and agenda.


Netanyahu is also facing his own legal troubles and is motivated to eliminate the Iranian regime, which he views as a direct threat to Israel's security. These motivations create a dangerous cocktail of political maneuvering, where national and international stability could be sacrificed for personal and political gain. Overall his goal is to keep the U.S. in the Middle East and to remain in power.

Netanyahu sabatoged the Oslo accords, in the 90s. Even out of power he continued to have a lot of influence. 
He‚Äôs been in power long enough.

What‚Äôs your take?"

1fkt0gh,Is It Wrong for Jews and Palestinians in Israel to Collect Food for Hungry Gazans?,2024-09-19 19:19:04,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fkt0gh/is_it_wrong_for_jews_and_palestinians_in_israel/,"**Excerpts from an Op Ed in Haaretz on Sept. 19, 2024 by Sally Abed, a founder of the Israeli-Palestinian peace movement Standing Together:**

""The largest mobilization of Palestinian citizens of Israel since October 7."" That is how Standing Together's campaign to collect food donations for the starving in Gaza, launched a month ago, has been described.

This aid drive isn't the first of its kind, but it's on a scale unlike any other Israel-based humanitarian initiative to help Gaza since the start of the war. From the north and the south, we collected 400 trucks-worth of¬†[aid donated](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-09-02/ty-article/.premium/israels-arab-community-donated-dozens-of-tons-of-aid-to-gaza-but-israel-blocks-its-entry/00000191-a8a6-d3dd-a991-a8be2e7d0000)¬†by tens of thousands of Palestinian citizens of Israel.

So eager were people to donate, that in some towns people set up their own impromptu collection areas, from which they drove trucks loaded with food to our campaign's 'official' collection sites. While I am writing these words, hundreds of people are volunteering every day in warehouses in cities throughout the country, preparing many tons of aid to be transported to the civilian population in Gaza.¬†

On TikTok, Instagram and in the media, there were millions of interactions and significant coverage of the aid drive, mostly from inside Israel, but also from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. But there were also¬†[negative and skeptical voices](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/2024-08-22/ty-article-magazine/.premium/more-political-than-humanitarian-aid-campaigns-for-gaza-divide-palestinian-israelis/00000191-7082-d988-a3b5-71ea1de40000)¬†casting doubt on the authenticity and motivations of those involved.¬†

The concerns are based on one fundamental assumption: **That Israeli Jews aren't truly interested in advancing**¬†[**equality between Jews and Palestinians**](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2024-06-30/ty-article-opinion/.premium/the-israeli-left-champions-equality-but-not-for-arabs/00000190-6a4d-d747-add0-eaddd9710000)¬†**inside Israel, nor do they genuinely want to advance freedom and justice for Palestinians toward a sustainable Israeli-Palestinian peace. Thus, they contend, any initiative (like that of Standing Together) based on a partnership with Israeli Jews, including initiatives aimed at the welfare of Palestinians, even a food drive for hungry Gazans, is illegitimate.**¬†

Those who hold this position believe that Jewish Israelis have no interest in changing the status quo, in which they are currently hegemonic, ""benefiting"" from what they characterize as a¬†[Jewish supremacist regime](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2024-09-05/ty-article-opinion/.premium/kahanes-spirit-of-jewish-supremacy-lives-on-in-mainstream-israel/00000191-c382-df27-a9b9-fb9a1b8d0000), and that therefore they are ""beyond redemption."" Any partnership effectively normalizes Jewish supremacy.¬†

Indeed, on average, there is no debate that, compared to Palestinian citizens of Israel, a Jewish Israeli enjoys more security, better healthcare and education, better infrastructure and more justice from Israel's judicial system. Likewise, Palestinians suffer disproportionately from second-class citizenship,¬†[military occupation](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/editorial/2024-07-21/ty-article-opinion/israels-continued-denial-of-the-reality-of-the-occupation-will-be-its-ruin/00000190-d1d9-decf-a7b2-d5ff5c180000), siege and apartheid.

**But the assumption that Jewish Israelis don't also pay a price at all is not only misinformed and disconnected, but is also catastrophic from a strategic point of view, as it effectively seals the political impossibility of ever reaching a solution to the ongoing plight of the Palestinian people.**

And here is a confession: Standing Together is unapologetically, proudly, primarily, and intentionally a political movement. We aim to build power for change, to construct a new paradigm based on joint struggle, and create the political will within Israeli society to demand a cease-fire, a hostage deal, to end the occupation, and work towards peace, equality, justice, and freedom for all.

You can disagree with our ideology, but arguing with our methodology is much harder ‚Äì because it is working. The friction we are creating along the way, including the¬†[pushback on our Gaza aid initiative](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-07-16/ty-article/far-right-groups-blocking-aid-to-gaza-receive-tax-deductible-donations-from-us-and-israel/00000190-ba8f-db47-abb0-baffc7370000), validates our movement and our growth. There is no movement without friction.

What the critics of our activism don't, or can't, explain is what is motivating Palestinian citizens of Israel to get involved with Standing Together.

¬†...

Real change must be built from the grassroots and cannot be based on external forces alone. Bringing about the radical change required to end the occupation must come from the collective self-interest of not only the Palestinians, but also of Israeli Jews.

If Palestinians operate under the assumption that all Jewish-Palestinian partnerships inside Israel are invalid, if not seditious, only an external savior can offer a solution for which Palestinians must wait, while trying to ""survive"" as a collective. The main act of defiance and resistance becomes narrative preservation, oral history, and cultural performance.¬†

I am not dismissing their importance: the resilience of Palestinian citizens' collective narrative, despite the continuous and vicious attacks to erase, is a major source of my strength and pride. These voices have very deep, resonant sentiments, that I find myself ""liking,"" sending around, sharing. They can even provide an accurate commentary on our unfathomable reality and tragedy. It is, however, insufficient. It lacks a well-rounded theory of change, and therefore a serious intention to change reality...

We are committed to building a different, better social and political alternative, and not from the safety of the keyboard of a social media 'activist' or from the alienated isolation of academia, because we insist on operating from within the society we want to change, and not as an observer or analyst."

Hello, I am doing research and documentation into the ongoing war in the Middle East for my personal project on a history of this war. 
I‚Äôve been checking the news on it every day since October 7th, and it occurred to me that I could get a better understanding of the war by asking people on the ground. I am part of various telegram channels and that has its value (for instance, two days ago 4 IDF soldiers died in Rafah, and I found this out about a day before it was announced by Israel). But asking people on the ground is possibly more valuable.


My aim is to one day write a day by day history of this war. As detailed as possible. Some may say, of what use is personal anecdotes? Well many historians have highlighted their utility. Like one Fernand Braudel (as a quick aside, his book on the Mediterranean is quite interesting though i jave not finished it). 


I‚Äôd like to do the same for the other side, but that is quite tricky. And unless I stay in Turkey, possibly illegal üò¨. Though if anyone has any insider info on said other side, be it in Yemen or Lebanon or the West Bank or Gaza, well I‚Äôm not sure how, but I would be interested in more details.

Possibly Iraq and Syria too. Since those areas have been wrapped up in the war to some extent as well. Especially if you live nearby whatever militia.

1fkfc54,Anti-semitic countries voting at UNGA for a resolution demanding Israel ends the occupation of Palestine in 12 months and implementing an arms embargo,2024-09-19 07:39:23,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fkfc54/antisemitic_countries_voting_at_unga_for_a/,"I suppose most of you have already seen the UN vote yesterday which is very disappointing: https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154496. I won't go into too much details, but you can see it in the link and will give you my own opinions here.

Highlights:

* Resolution calling for the Jews to withdraw their military forces from Palestine in 12 months because their presence there is unlawful
* Evacuate all the Jews from ""occupied"" land aka Judea, Samaria, and East Jerusalem because it is illegal under the 4th Geneva Convention
* Dismantle parts of the terror-prevention wall based on the 2005 ICJ ruling
* Mechanism for reparations to address damage, loss, or injury caused by Israel‚Äôs actions (LOL!!!)

All of this is never going to happen anyway and we all know it.

My disappointments:

* EU countries like Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, FINLAND, Greece, Iceland, drunk Ireland, Norway, Portugal, and Spain voting for it. What do these countries think? Some of them are supposed to be allied with the Jews and prefer backstabbing instead! Absolutely hopeless!
* Germany abstaining: they seem to have learnt nothing from the 1940s and now slowing down arms exports: [https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-09-16/ty-article/.premium/germany-reportedly-slows-arms-exports-to-israel-significantly-amid-gaza-war-concerns/00000191-fa58-d02f-a7d5-ff5f3dfb0000](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-09-16/ty-article/.premium/germany-reportedly-slows-arms-exports-to-israel-significantly-amid-gaza-war-concerns/00000191-fa58-d02f-a7d5-ff5f3dfb0000)
* India also supposed to love the Jews and just abstaining

Hopeful aspects:

* USA continuing to support Israel. But I really hope Trump becomes president coz if Kamala ends up, one day she might be brainwashed by the Squad and one day abstain from or vote for a critical UNSC resolution.
* Argentina under Milei seems to [love the Jews](https://www.jta.org/2024/09/16/global/argentina-posts-44-increase-in-reported-antisemitic-incidents-in-2023-mostly-after-oct-7).
* Malawi, Fiji, and Paraguay as new allies in a dark world.

Here are my recommendations what Israel should do moving forward:

* Flatten Gaza and deradicalise the population living there.
* Settle the hilltops of Judea Samaria and build even more in Jerusalem to mark presence there so that it waves a middle finger to the world and each time the Palestinians try diplomatic terrorism, another area gets settled!
* Secure long-lasting USA support by working very closely with the Republicans and purging the anti-semitic left among the Dems.

Overall, even though these toothless UN resolutions are meaningless, I am very disappointed with the vote. Nevertheless, not of these will be implemented, they are jealous that Israel is winning the current war and thoroughly crushing Palestine!"
1fkesb1,How accurate is the Gaza Health Ministry? ,2024-09-19 06:56:30,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fkesb1/how_accurate_is_the_gaza_health_ministry/,"So I was on a TikTok live about Israel/Palestine, with the host named Nick Matau being super pro-Israel talking to pro-Palestinians.

Everyone was talking about the Gaza death toll from the Israel-Hamas war, and one of the pro-Palestinians said that the Gaza health ministry has been historically accurate with its numbers. Like when third-party organizations come in to count the deaths themselves, their numbers match the health ministry's toll. The host Nick then argued that this was the case because the health ministry would slash the death toll at the last minute, and then give that new refined number for verification, so they could then say their number was accurate.

He also claimed that the Gaza Ministry would shift the people's ages to make them appear younger. Like 18-year-olds one month would appear to be 17 another month and so on to make it look like Israel is killing so many minors.

I was wondering about the accuracy of the host's claims. Like is the ""Hamas-run"" health ministry really as unreliable like he claims? I'm trying to research this and have a hard time verifying any of this yet.

I always thought the death toll numbers were accurate based on some research I've done so far. For example, here's one report from the Lancet stating that there's no evidence they inflate numbers:

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02713-7/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02713-7/fulltext)

These claims from the host are so new to me.

I'm eager to hear everyone's thoughts!

If anyone has seen Nick's lives on tiktok, I would also love to hear your opinion about them. His lives keep showing up on my fyp.

  
EDIT: I'll give the example the host gave to explain how GHM slashes the death toll: 

The GHM would report 10k people dead from a war. Third-party orgs will ask to verify this themselves, and right before they check, the GHM would then slash their death toll to a realistic 6k last minute. that last-minute 6k death toll would be used in comparison to third-party numbers which would also verify its 6k. So essentially, with the GHM's toll and third-party toll matching, the GHM can say their numbers are accurate. These are hypothetical numbers, but I hope this example clarifies things. "
1fkee4r,UN members vote to demand Israel end occupation of Palestinian territories within 12 months,2024-09-19 06:26:34,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fkee4r/un_members_vote_to_demand_israel_end_occupation/,"Another classic 

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/18/middleeast/un-israel-end-occupation-palestine-intl/index.html

https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-resolution-demanding-israel-exit-occupied-territories-can-hurt-highly-volatile-situation-expert-says.amp

Since there another ""Israel should leave the occupied territories of Palestine"" moment I want to address one thing that Israel has to do 
this: To ensure Palestine has no other funny ideas and eternal peace Security Guarantees are recommended. 

>Israel‚Äôs new ambassador calling the measure ""shameful."" 

>""This is a shameful decision that backs the Palestinian Authority‚Äôs diplomatic terrorism,"" Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon said after the vote.  

If it was shameful to withdraw without the Security Guarantees

>Instead of marking the anniversary of the Oct. 7 massacre by condemning Hamas and calling for the release of all 101 of the remaining hostages, the General Assembly continues to dance to the music of the Palestinian Authority, which backs the Hamas murderers,"" Danon added.

> International Court of Justice (ICJ) that determined Israel‚Äôs occupation of the Palestinian territories and settlements is illegal and should be withdrawn. 

If The General Assembly and the ICJ knew of their actions and cruelty of Hamas and the IDFs actions in Gaza, they should allow Hamas should release all 101 hostages and follow either The three-phase Israel‚ÄìHamas war ceasefire proposal or their own proposals with the latter involving releasing 1/3 of Palestines population in the prisons Including children and also peaceful withdrawal but no the clusterfrickery continues

>The U.S. voted against the resolution and was joined by Argentina, Czech Republic, Fiji, Hungary, Israel, Malawi, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Tonga and Tuvalu. 

Why is Papua New Guinea go against it? I'm Not suprised about Argentina but it's pretty interesting that most Polynesian Countries go against for reasons yet to be fathom

>In its advisory opinion, the ICJ said Israel should end its occupation ‚Äúas rapidly as possible.‚Äù The UN‚Äôs resolution gives a 12-month timeline 

If they have enough time to dismantle or handed over the settlements to Palestine, also Zionist jews should not EVER go back to Europe all thanks to the rise of Jewish immigration to Europe followed by the rampant rise of the far right.

>Riyad Mansour, Palestinian ambassador to the UN, called the vote a turning point ‚Äúin our struggle for freedom and justice.‚Äù

>The Palestinians have a kind of absolute right to self-determination, and that means that Israel's presence in the territories has become illegal,"" he added. ""Now, legally‚Ä¶ there's a lot to be said about this. For example‚Ä¶ never before has the right to self-determination been given this level of priority."" 

If Palestine finally gets its freedom and the aid goes to Gaza, they have to make sure it's actually going to the people(innocent men, women, and children) not Hamas fighters so we're not gonna have a second Oct 7 in case Hamas re arms itself again and prevent Zionist settlers to return to Gaza again

>Neither the ICJ advisory opinion nor the assembly resolution are binding, however the two decisions could further isolate Israel as world leaders prepare to meet next week in New York for the annual UN General Assembly. 

I don't think they'll be isolated they have to make amends to Palestine and the world

>Israel should immediately heed the demand of an overwhelming majority of UN member states to abide by the World Court‚Äôs historic ruling on Israel‚Äôs decades-long occupation,‚Äù Louis Charbonneau, UN director at HRW, said in a statement.

>Amnesty International also welcomed the resolution and called on Israel to abide by it. 

If Bibi, Gvir, Smolotch said otherwise knowing them they'll just chug along and continue their shenanigans to Palestine 

>whereas the ICJ merely said it should be done ""immediately 

Impatient af huh 

  

>Tucker argued that the implications of such a decision could lead to ""greater conflict"" because Israel‚Äôs expedited exit could leave open the chance for Iran to dig into the West Bank the same way it did with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. 

>If Israel withdraws from these territories‚Ä¶ It's only 10 kilometers from there at the smallest [point] between the West Bank and Tel Aviv,"" Tucker said.  

>So whoever gets control of these territories, if it's hostile toward Israel, which is unfortunately the case, we're facing a highly, highly volatile security situation,"" he added. 

That's the freaking point of the Security Guarantees, we have to make sure they're no problems in Palestine(West Bank) as long is everythings assured to be safe for Palestinians and Israelis, Peacekeeping forces in Gaza and West Bank have to be deployed there if not it'll be Israel, Jordan or even Both 

I support peace between the State of Israel and Palestine and I hope that we may see an end to the war and held anyone of both sides accountable 

I support a free Palestine and I support Israels right to exist

If this doesn't work then we all live in a ""society"""

From reports by Aljazeera, this attack followed an [Israeli settlement of a Mosque](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/4/israeli-settlers-storm-al-aqsa-mosque-complex-on-fifth-day-of-sukkot) during the 5th day of Sukkot, a 7 day holiday celebrating harvest and the exodus of Egypt. It seems unclear, but appears that Rabbi's in the past have forbidden entering of this Mosque, making this event tumultuous.  
  
Since then, and long before, Hamas controlled power has waged war on the Israeli nation. Palestinians have been fighting for democratic control for decades, and in 2006 Hamas gained enough votes to cement their lead over a fragmented PLO, the Palestinian Liberation Organization. According to this report, [40% of the population](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2023-11-14/population-religion-and-poverty-the-demographics-of-israel-and-gaza) in Palestine is under 14, and the median age was 18 in 2020, meaning that a majority of the remaining population has been unable to vote, and a large number have only known life under Hamas rule.  
  
The situation has further complicated with the Lebanese Hezbollah to the north of Israel, also pushing into the territory. According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/returning-residents-north-israel-is-now-war-goal-netanyahu-says-2024-09-17/), Hezbollah joined the war the day after the October 7th attack, and has declared they will also cease the fighting on the borders when a ceasefire deal with Palestine has been achieved.  
  
However, this ceasefire only requires 2 signatures: one from Hamas Leadership Yahya Sinwar, who's [demands](https://nypost.com/2024/08/21/world-news/oct-7-mastermind-and-hamas-leader-yaya-sinwar-reportedly-adds-new-demand-for-cease-fire-deal-dont-kill-me/) appear to be a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the region, as well as establishment of a port (something Israel has denied Palestinians from building), and release of prisoners, something he deemed very important as a former prisoner himself. The other, from Netanyahu, Prime minister of Israel, who has [promised total victory](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-netanyahu-sinwar-ceasefire-talks-c00b30d31ac8d25592ce63c2398097a5) over Hamas, and seems to have ambitious goals of controlling multiple strategic points in the region, and wants to maintain the feeling of victory amid losing power in his own political party and corruption investigations.  
  
This war has too many factors to fully encompass the full context, and a clear goal appears to be a ceasefire, hostage returns, and a two state solution that allows Palestinians to have their own homes back. While this is a foreign nation, who deserves to have it's own interests and citizen safety protected, foreign policy pressure can have massive effects. Currently, the US is responsible for [65%](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68737412) of weapon sales/imports into Israel, totaling 3.8 billion dollars annually. This allows US policy to be vastly impactful in the determination of the winner of this war.  
  
What policy/position should the government take?

The supposed ""surgical"" attack that has filled hospitals in Lebanon is another deep and probably irreversible attack on peace. 

To clearly identify myself: I'm against any violence and oppression of any people of any religion or color. Thus,
Hezbollah is definitely not a group that I identify with. 

However what is happening today is completely against the interest of Israelis. Because: 

- it doesn't bring hostages back
- it doesn't strengthen security
- it undermines any peace talks
- it will, most probably, cause widespread conflict 

And therefore the simplest question would be:
Why does Israel do this? 

The answer to me can only be one. Bibi understands that Kamala will probably win the elections and push him to accept a peace deal. As he has done multiple times until now (including before October 7th) he will instigate war and violence to stay in power. 

Why do Israelis put up with this? "

Would you:

a) Let Cuba keep the hostages so that they will eventually torture and kill the hostages while also enabling them to make another attack and capture more hostages or

b) Invade Cuba and rescue the hostages even at the expense of your global reputation and the lives of innocent Cubans?

If you have a brain and heart, you'd likely go with b, which is what Israel is currently doing in Gaza. But wait, there's more.

I messaged in the group and told them to stop sharing such terroristic videos, but everyone pounced back and mentioned that this is not terrorism but armed resistance from groups in Gaza which are fighting back against the evil Zionist soldiers and tanks crushing down residential buildings etc... Some also pointed out the recent ICJ ruling forbidding the Jews from entering into Rafah to find a final solution to all the resistance battalions in Palestine. What do these people think? That Palestinians can successfully resist against the 4th strongest military in the world which has nukes as well?



To me, I can't understand the concept of resistance behind all these actions. After all, it was Hamas which started off all the massacres of 1400 civilians. Maybe the war would have ended by now by their fighters just came out, surrendered, and released all the hostages. Recruiting new members and shooting at the tanks and Jewish soldiers is anti-semitic especially when they are trying to find the hostages and this is just delaying the war and many children are dying needlessly because of it.



Overall, I am disappointed as to how many people consider the Red Triangle üîª videos in Gaza as any kind of legitimate resistance. Nevertheless, I would like to hear more insightful opinions from people in this group."

1fjs5rp,The accusations that Israel has committed terrorist attack against population of Lebanon are laughable.,2024-09-18 12:57:30,256,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fjs5rp/the_accusations_that_israel_has_committed/,"The accusations that Israel ""has committed a terrorist attack against the population of Lebanon"" are laughable.
The attack was SURGICAL against the Hezbollah terrorists.
I explain to you why the Lebanese civilian population was NOT affected.

The point here is that anti-Israeli propaganda wants to convince us that the attack consisted of randomly ""exploding"" communication devices and, therefore, there could not have been precise control. The victims would have been random, according to this logic.

here are two serious problems with this idea.
One, which assumes that Israel works magic and can make ALL communication devices of a certain type explode just like that.
No way. That only happens in cartoons.

To make the explosion possible, Israel first INFILTRATED Hezbollah's supply chains, and then arranged for the devices to be tampered with (and this happened in Iran, where they were opened, the explosive was placed, and then closed again).

In addition, they were also given a kind of ""fingerprint"" so that they could be traced by the Israeli army. And today they were given a ""call"" (meaning that Israel had the precise data on how to contact them). In other words, Israel knew who it was attacking.

But the other reason is even funnier: assuming that this was an indiscriminate attack in which many Lebanese civilians were killed at random, also implies assuming that, in 2024, in Lebanon they still communicate with beepers (or whatever each country calls them).

This is communication technology from the 80s and 90s. Believe it or not, today's Lebanese are ordinary people who communicate via cell phones. Pagers have been limited in their use to very select and limited groups.

That was the reason Hezbollah decided to replace cell phones with pagers. It thought that this way there was no risk of Israel hacking encrypted communications. And it was right on that level, but it didn't count on Israel coming up with a good alternative with pagers.

But anti-Israeli logic is unable to assimilate this.

Anti Israelis says that the people standing next to the beeper bearers were injured, but the video clearly shows that they were not. The magnitude of the explosions did not cause any harm to the two people standing nearby.
Therefore, the victims were THOSE WHO HAD A BEEPER.

Do doctors in Lebanon have pagers? Maybe, but there is another thing: in NONE of the videos that have circulated of victims arriving at the hospital, can any doctor be seen. Logically, many of them should have arrived wounded, still in their work clothes. But no.

Finally, for ALL beeper users to be injured, Israel would have had to have detonated ALL the beepers. I repeat: if it is not magic.
The special shipment for Hezbollah, purchased in Taiwan and altered in Iran, was detonated.

Oh, yes. It was also reported that a 10-year-old girl had died. Of course, because in Lebanon 10-year-old girls communicate with pagers.
It's up to you if you want to believe them. It would just be a desire to be an idiot.
This operation was surgically precise.

Hezbollah, for its part, must be less than heart-stopping. If Israel has already gotten into them up to that point (the little device you usually put next to one of your testicles), how far has it not already gotten into them?"
1fjqs78,The pager attacks were terrorism.,2024-09-18 11:46:55,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fjqs78/the_pager_attacks_were_terrorism/,"I'm operating under the assumption that yesterday's series of explosions across Lebanon and Syria were perpetrated by Israel. Understanding this has not been confirmed by Israel or independently verified by a reliable third party yet, I think it's a reasonable conclusion to make -- no other party has both the motivation to attack those two countries in this way, and the capability for such a sophisticated operation.

Terrorism, of course, is an inherently subjective term, that can be understood from different perspectives and may be said to encompass different aspects. For our purposes, I believe it's reasonable to say that the most universally accepted definition of terrorism is the use of violence against civilians to accomplish some political goal. 

What do we know about yesterday's events in Lebanon and Syria? At around 15:45 local time, a series of explosions occurred in southern Lebanon, Beirut, and Damascus, lasting for about an hour. At least some of these explosions occurred in public places, including a supermarket, a cafe, and in traffic. The source of these explosions was apparently pager devices used by members of Hezbollah, in an attempt to avoid Israeli interception of their communications and geodata. As of last night, the Lebanese Ministry of Health reported 2,750 casualties from the explosions, including the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon, the son of a Lebanese parliamentarian affiliated with Hezbollah's political wing, and at least several men claimed by Hezbollah as among its fighters; 14 casualties were additionally reported in Syria. At least nine people have been reported as killed in Lebanon, including, tragically, an eight year old girl. These attacks came immediately following the Israeli government's announcement that it now considers returning displaced Israelis from the northern border region to their homes as a war goal in the current conflict.

So, what can we make of this? It is reasonable to describe this as a targeted operation against  a militant group that poses a threat to Israel. However, Israel certainly must have known, or reasonably should have known, that this method of attack would produce collateral damage in the form of civilian casualties. An explosion, no matter how small, is, by nature, indiscriminate. An explosion will injure or kill anyone within its blast radius, regardless of their civilian or combatant status. Even a 5-10g charge of C4 or a similar plastic explosives can cause death or serious injury from, say, 1 meter away.

Think of how many times a day you are within 1 meter of others -- on public transportation, standing in line, sitting at a restaurant, at work, I could go on. Hezbollah are not completely isolated from the civilian population -- in fact, Israel loves to point out how its adversaries intentionally embed themselves among civilians! Why, then, would Israel choose to commit such a massive operation, using a manner they knew or should have known would very likely cause civilian casualties? The only explanation was that they considered such potential casualties acceptable, or, perhaps worse, that they considered the terror inflicted to be desirable.

Israel employed violence in a manner that it must have known, or reasonably should have known, would cause harm to civilians. It apparently did so with the aim of deterring Hezbollah from further attacks against northern Israel to allow the civilian population to return -- in other words, in order to achieve a political objective. Israel committed an act of mass terror yesterday in Lebanon and Syria."

On 9/11 my mom shrugged and said ‚Äúlooks like they‚Äôve upgraded from bombing bus stops.‚Äù  We didn‚Äôt know who was responsible then of course but her response was basically the same once we did know.  

I grew up looking at the world from a very objective lens, or a strange lens at least.  People do horrible things to each other, and in my opinion the more powerful often do the most damage.  

I digress.  I worked with at a Middle Eastern restaurant owned by an Iraqi who could be absolutely terrifying but never was to me.  He protected me and the kids (really young adults) he‚Äôd sponsor as refugees from Iraq.   His manager was Palestinian, just a really sweet guy.  My friend who worked there too, her dad was also a manager of sorts, also Palestinian, and she said her dad was lucky because he came from Jerusalem and could go back home while this other guy?  He never could, it was destroyed.  

Also keep in mind one of our regulars was an Israeli expat who would frequently spend hours talking about home with these guys.  

2012 was happening and people were joking about it being the end of the world and whatnot.  It was slow, we were sitting across a table from each other and he said ‚ÄúI hope it ends.  It‚Äôs horrible what we do to one another.‚Äù  And he had such sadness in his eyes.  Even though he had escaped and made a prosperous life here he still was just‚Ä¶changed by what had happened to him.  

I haven‚Äôt been through what he had so I of course have hope but‚Ä¶I too am sickened by what we do to one another.  What we justify.  I always have been.  People say ‚Äúgrow up!‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs complicated‚Äù and to me it really isn‚Äôt.  Not now.  Maybe right after WWII it was a sort of complicated I can empathize with, people just scrambling to survive.  But it isn‚Äôt that complicated now.  

There are those with the power to make changes that could mend these broken hearts and there are those who have no power. 

I still wonder about him.  And worry about him.  He‚Äôs the only person I‚Äôve ever met who experienced the sort of‚Ä¶existential angst I felt.  The hopelessness.  The despair.  Not aimed at any one person but at humanity as a whole.  "

A, B or C is occupied? Or All (A + B + C, all of West Bank is occupied ) ?

2. I heard people said ICJ or other international law, but which exact article of the law makes West Bank occupied territory ? If you could drop a quote below would be good.

My initial research said something article 42‚Ä¶.because the authority of the land is placed under a hostile military. ‚Ä¶.so if its not a military, it is not occupied anymore ? Like if you give it to the settlers / civilian volunteers to run their own show,‚Ä¶they are not military. Does it then automatically become not an occupation ? ‚Ä¶or is there something else/ something more to this ? 

Why is it hostile army ? Didnt the Palestinian Authority signed the Oslo Accord‚Ä¶. Isnt it kinda like‚Ä¶.of I agreed your army can come into West Bank especially in Area C‚Ä¶ is Palestinian Authority at war with Israel ? No right ? If its not a hostile army, just following the Oslo Accord, why is it occupied territory ?

3. If West Bank is occupied territory, what is the Palestinian Authority then ? I thought the Palestinian Authority is the Palestinian government ? Is the Palestinian Authority the government in exile ? No ? So, what exactly does the Palestinian Authority do ?

4. How does the current arrangement ties with the Oslo Accord brokered by the Norwegian government ? Is this areas A, B and C not agreed in the Oslo Accord ? "
1fjcydj,The most irritating thing about this conflict is that Jews and Arabs get blamed for a conflict that white Christians (namely the Brits) started...,2024-09-17 22:29:38,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fjcydj/the_most_irritating_thing_about_this_conflict_is/,"Jewish people were dying in immense numbers, and now Arabs are going through the same fate, and both somehow are surviving despite the INFILTRATION of this shit by countries that are hands off.   
  
The British Empire was already deep in its colonial phase during WWI and made promises to both Arabs and Jews that directly contradicted each other. Does no one remember the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence? They basically told Arab leaders that they would support an independent Arab state if they rebelled against the Ottoman Empire. Then, almost immediately after, the Balfour Declaration of 1917 promised a *""national home for the Jewish people""* in Palestine. These two promises were fundamentally at odds, they knew this, they didn't care, and now look what's happening.  If Jewish people weren't tenacious and fought back post holocaust, they wouldn't exist. And now look at the mess they're in. The Brits were trying to play both sides and it irritates me to death that they're not being blamed but instead it's just rampant hatred of Jews and Arabs online by people who couldn't give a damn about either.
  
Let us not forget the Brits were the ones that  
 
- Promised the Arabs independence in 1915   
- Then promised Jews a ""national home"" in 1917   
- Took over Palestine post-WWI like they owned the place   
- Spent 30 years playing referee between Jews and Arabs, and clearly dropped the ball.
- Left in 1948 like, *""Good luck, you guys sort it out""*"

I really hope it is true and the State Department is successfully able to convince or threaten South Africa to drop it. What do the South Africans think? Just because they were able to end apartheid in their country doesn't mean they could go about falsely accusing everyone else of all sorts of crimes. Look at South Africa first of all, what a mess it is in! And there is genocide going on in their own country against white farmers. You also cannot walk on any of the streets without getting robbed,

Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela were notorious for their slander of Jews. There is also Andrew Feinstein, the fake Jew who is going around lobbying UK to cut all sorts of contracts with Israel: [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/10/politics-is-broken-a-south-african-anti-zionist-challenges-uks-starmer](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/10/politics-is-broken-a-south-african-anti-zionist-challenges-uks-starmer) Apparently he grew up during the apartheid era and fought against the systems then, but who knows.

Overall, I have been very disappointed that this case is going on. But, hopefully Congress will put pressure especially with the newer conservative govt and USA is also putting pressure on the ICC after the Islamist Wahabbist Karim Khan has advocated for arrest warrants against the only Jewish State's leader."

1fiz3fr,Israeli settlers attack students and teachers at West bank elementary school,2024-09-17 13:20:59,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fiz3fr/israeli_settlers_attack_students_and_teachers_at/,"For those of you who continue to vehemently deny settler violence exists and is protected by the IDF. 

At approximately 9:47 am on Monday, while the school was in session, Israeli settlers armed with clubs, aggressively entered the school, assaulted teachers and students, and tied up the principal of the school. Preliminary reports state that three female teachers and some students were injured, along with a British solidarity activist who was transferred to a Palestinian hospital.

Footage from the attack shows a group of male settlers marching into the school, and one can hear the screams of children and the teachers during the attack. The school employs 30 teachers who serve around 100 students and has been supported by the WBPC.

When Israeli security forces arrived, it was reported that they arrested the school principal. THE ISRAELI POLICE CONFISCATED THE SCHOOLS DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDER, which the police claimed was in order to review the incident. Video footage shows the identities of most of the assailants.

Under international humanitarian law, Area C where this school is located is occupied territory. The occupying power is obligated to protect school children and facilitate their continued education. It is also prohibited from transferring its own citizens to settlements and outposts in the occupied territory, such as those in this area northwest of Jericho.


Israel continue to break international law with no consequences from any one, while people continue to find some crappy way to defend it. Everyone on this subreddits always talking about giving Palestinians a proper education not to hate Israelis. I‚Äôm sure this is making them love them. 

They beat Palestinian at the mosque, they beat kids for playing soccer or riding their bike in the wrong street. They arrest their loved ones without trial or cause. They break their arms or legs, and then expect them to grow up to love the IDF and love Israelis. They‚Äôve killed 700 Palestinians in the West Bank since October 7th and no one has batted an eye.

Let‚Äôs talk about the most common defense from the truth that Israel apartheid is not a apartheid state is:

>*‚ÄúThe West Bank \[Gaza, and East Jerusalem\] is not Israel. It's not Apartheid, it's an occupation.‚Äù*

Now this is not exactly a great defense, you know, your side isn‚Äôt good if your best defense is: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt do apartheid we just brutally occupy foreign lands!!!‚Äù

Still, this argument that Israel can‚Äôt be a apartheid state because it only practices apartheid in the West Bank can be dismantled easily. You see, **‚Äúoccupation‚Äù and ‚Äúapartheid‚Äù are not mutually exclusive**. Contrary to what is argued by some scholars **there is nothing in international law that excludes the application of apartheid to occupied territory.** The fact that apartheid is most commonly seen as a violation of the right to internal self-determination of a people, merely reflects the most famous case of apartheid‚Äìthat of South Africa‚Äìwhich occurred within the very same state.

So now that we have proven that ‚Äúapartheid‚Äù and ‚Äúoccupation‚Äù is not mutually exclusive it is easy to say that Israel is an apartheid state because within the West Bank it clearly imposes a dual legal system where **Israeli settlers are governed by civil law** while **Palestinians are governed by Israeli military law**. This causes Palestinians to face severe movement restrictions, are required to pass through checkpoints, are denied access to many roads used by settlers, and are stripped of basic civil liberties and legal protections.

If you‚Äôre pro-Israel and reading this you might think:

>*‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt that mean every occupation is apartheid?‚Äù*

And no, it doesn‚Äôt. Take a current occupation, like Russia‚Äôs occupation of Crimea‚ÄìUnlike the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem there isn‚Äôt a legal framework in place that enforces different rights for people based on their ethnicity. While ethnic minorities like Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars face repression and discrimination, these actions stem from targeted, arbitrary enforcement by Russian authorities rather than a formal legal system that assigns them a subordinate status. This type of repression, while reprehensible, is less systematically entrenched than the form of apartheid found elsewhere.

>(5) by twelve votes to three, Finds that Serbia has violated the obligation to prevent genocide, under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, in respect of the genocide that occurred in Srebrenica in July 1995;

However, that was far from the only atrocity that took place during the war.

You can read the wiki page, or the judgment itself, but I'll provide some highlights as well.

>Estimates of the total number of casualties have ranged from 25,000 to 329,000

>An estimated 12,000‚Äì50,000¬†[women were raped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_Bosnian_War), most of them Bosnian Muslims with the majority of cases committed by Serb forces.

More detailed information regarding the [rapes during the Bosnian War.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_Bosnian_War)

>According to the commission's findings, it was apparent that r**ape was being used by Serb forces systematically, and had the support of commanders and local authorities**. The commission also reported that some perpetrators said they were ordered to rape. Others said that the use of rape was a tactic to make sure the targeted population would not return to the area.  
The team of European Community investigators, including¬†[Simone Veil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Veil)¬†and¬†[Anne Warburton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Warburton), similarly concluded in their 1993 report that¬†**rape carried out by the Bosnian Serb forc**es was not a secondary effect of the conflict but¬†**part of a systematic policy of ethnic cleansing**¬†and was ""perpetrated with the conscious intention of demoralizing and terrorizing communities, driving them from their home regions and demonstrating the power of the invading forces"".  
**Serb forces set up ""rape camps""**¬†where women were imprisoned,¬†**tortured and raped over a period of years**. Women held at the camps were only released when pregnant.¬†**Gang rape and public rapes in front of villagers and neighbors were not uncommon.**  
At the concentration camp \[Omarska\], rape, sexual assaults and torture of men and women were commonplace. One newspaper described the events there as ""the location of an orgy of killing, mutilation, beating and rape"".¬†Rape, murder and physical abuse were commonplace.

And there was an[ ethnic cleansing conducted by the Serb forces.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing_in_the_Bosnian_War#Serb_forces)

>Between 700,000 and a 1,000,000 Bosniaks were expelled from their homes from the Bosnian territory held by the Serb forces.

The Serb forces set up concentration camps. So did the Bosnians as well.  [Omarska Concentration Camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omarska_camp) is one of those camps.

>Murder,¬†[torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture), rape, and abuse of prisoners was common. Around 6,000 Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats, mainly men, were held at the camp for about five months in the spring and summer of 1992. Hundreds died of starvation, punishment, beatings, ill-treatment and executions.

[Batkovic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batkovi%C4%87_camp) was another concentration camp.

>Detainees were held in two large barns and tortured, deprived of food and water, forced to dig trenches, carry ammunition to the front lines, work in fields and factories and bury the dead. Prisoners were subject to daily beatings,¬†sexual assault and forced to beat one another.

The war crimes go on and on and on.

In their judgment the ICJ stated the following:

>319. Having carefully examined the evidence presented before it, and taken note of that presented to the ICTY,¬†**the Court considers that it has been established by fully conclusive evidence that members of the protected group were systematically victims of massive mistreatment, beatings, rape and torture causing serious bodily and mental harm, during the conflict and, in particular, in the detention camps.**¬†The requirements of the material element, as defined by Article II (b) of the Convention are thus fulfilled.¬†**The Court find**s, however, on the basis of the evidence before it, that i**t has not been conclusively established that those atrocities,**¬†although they too may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity,¬†**were committed with the specific intent (dolus specialis) to destroy the protected group,**¬†in whole or in part,¬†***required for a finding that genocide has been perpetrated.***

Concentration camps. Civilians tortured. Systemic rape of civilians. Systemic murder of civilians. Forced displacement of millions. Forced starvation.

Terrible terrible things. And yet, not genocide.

In addition, I've seen Pro Palestinians state things such as ""Israel wants to take Gaza and the West Bank for themselves."" ""Ethnically cleanse the area of Palestinians."" as evidence of genocide. However, per the ICJ, those statements would be evidence that it is ***not*** genocide. Paragraph 372 of the Judgment

>Two years later he said (according to the translation of his speech supplied by the Applicant): ‚ÄúWe certainly know that we must give up something ‚Äî that is beyond doubt in so far as we want to achieve our first strategic goal: to drive our enemies by the force of war from their homes, that is the Croats and Muslims, so that we will no longer be together \[with them\] in a State.‚Äù

>The 1992 objectives do not include the elimination of the Bosnian Muslim population. The 1994 statement even on the basis of the Applicant‚Äôs translation, however shocking a statement, does not necessarily involve the intent to destroy in whole or in part the Muslim population in the enclaves. The Applicant‚Äôs argument does not come to terms with the fact that an essential motive of much of the Bosnian Serb leadership ‚Äî to create a larger Serb State, by a war of conquest if necessary ‚Äî did not necessarily require the destruction of the Bosnian Muslims and other communities, but their expulsion.

>The Court does not see the 1992 Strategic Goals as establishing the specific intent.

The ICJ is explicitly stating that creating a larger state and stealing land from other states through a war of conquest and terror does ***not*** meet the requirements to be considered the specific intent to destroy in whole or in part, a protected group. Which is a necessity for genocide. Again, per the ICJ's judgment.

Additionally, I've heard arguments that Israel is destroying Palestinian cultural and historical places, and that by doing this, it is evidence that they are committing genocide. However, the ICJ states the exact opposite in Paragraph 344.

>344. In light of the foregoing, the Court considers that there is conclusive evidence of the deliberate destruction of the historical, cultural and religious heritage of the protected group during the period in question....However, in the Court‚Äôs view, the destruction of historical, cultural and religious heritage cannot be considered to constitute the deliberate infliction of conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of the group. Although such destruction may be highly significant inasmuch as it is directed to the elimination of all traces of the cultural or religious presence of a group and contrary to other legal norms, it does not fall within the categories of acts of genocide set out in Article II of the Convention.

The court again, explicitly states that deliberately destroying historical, cultural and religious buildings is ***not*** evidence of genocide.

I've also heard the argument that Israeli politicians' statements are evidence of genocide. However, in a related, but different case, [Croatia v Serbia](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/118), Croatia submits [Statements Inciting Hatred Towards Non-Serbs ](https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/118/18184.pdf)as evidence. Page 65 of that doc. There are more statements as well, but that's where a lot of them are. The ICJ completely ignored the statements in their 2015 judgment and again ruled that Serbia did ***not*** commit genocide.

All of that is to say, what makes Israel/Gaza so bad that it rises to genocide when the atrocities Serbia committed did not?

Why are Pro Palestinians so convinced that Israel is committing genocide when all the arguments they use as 'evidence' of genocide has already been ruled on by the ICJ and they ruled it is ***not*** evidence of genocide?

I would love to hear from a Pro Palestinian a reason why they believe Israel is committing genocide that has not already been judged by the ICJ in regards to the Bosnian war."

With the constant exchange of fire in Israel‚Äôs northern border, 60,000 Israelis has been displaced. Why not just temporarily move them to Area C, in the West Bank ? Definitely dont Area A and B which are under Palestinian Authority. But there are able area in Area C to build temporary accomodation and shelter for these internally displaced.

The more Hezbollah fires rockets, the more people could be displaced, the more Israelis will be temporary relocated to Area C. We need a place to house them, they cant be living in hotels for months on end. And there is no sign that Hezbollah shelling would be stopping anytime soon, and if I can add, with or without Nethanyahu, things will continue to be volatile in northern Israel."
1fiqved,Apartheid Part 2: ‚ÄúBut What About‚Ä¶‚Äù Boogaloo.,2024-09-17 05:22:56,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fiqved/apartheid_part_2_but_what_about_boogaloo/,"Recently I made a post about Israel being an apartheid state and naturally a lot of Zionists tried to fight back against the claim, so I thought I would go through some of the arguments. Let‚Äôs begin.

>*‚ÄúThe entire Middle East except Israel, and pretty much the entire Islamic world (MENA and Asia), effectively enslaves 1/2 of its population, and u couldn‚Äôt be bothered to mention a word of that. It‚Äôs called gender apartheid.‚Äù*

This is a classic argument. Zionists will ignore any criticism of Israel and go: ‚ÄúBut what about how the Islamic world treats women.‚Äù

Now gender apartheid is horrific and Amnesty International believes that is should be recognized as a crime under international law (https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/06/gender-apartheid-must-be-recognized-international-law/) no one‚Äìme least of all‚Äìis arguing that gender apartheid is acceptable in any way shape or form, but the discussion is about how Israel treats its citizens not how other countries treats its citizens and by bringing up other countries what Zionists are doing is classic whataboutism‚Äìresponding to an accusation by making a counter-accusation or raising a different issue.

What really angers me about Israel is that any single critique of the country can be deflected by saying that other countries are just as bad or worse.

**We should be able to criticize countries that engage in gender apartheid without raising up countries that engage in regular apartheid like Israel, just as we should be able to criticize apartheid countries without ignoring how bad gender apartheid countries are. We as a society are capable of criticizing multiple countries at a time. And we should all recognize that the actions of one country in the same area does not justify actions of another country.**¬†

**Zionists want to say Israel is a beacon of freedom in the Middle East, but whenever someone points out that Israel isn‚Äôt a beacon they just shrug and say: ‚ÄúWhatever, nowhere in the Middle East is free.‚Äù**

The second argument I saw a lot of was:

>*‚ÄúAll citizens of Israel have the same rights.‚Äù*

You can‚Äôt even call this an argument, it‚Äôs just a falsehood. There are many ways in which Arab Israelis don‚Äôt have the same rights as Jewish Israelis as I outlined in my original post but let‚Äôs just go over one example.

Property rights: Israeli Arabs can not reclaim land they owned pre 1948 that the government took from them (e.g., in the form of ‚Äúpresent absentees‚Äù) but Jewish Israelis can reclaim lands they owned pre 1948 in East Jerusalem (https://www.nrc.no/perspectives/2021/10-things-you-should-know-about-the-evictions-in-east-jerusalem/)

**This current system of property rights is clearly hypocritical, either every Israeli citizen Jew or Arab should be able to reclaim lands owned pre 1948 or no one should be allowed to. This is a clear cut example of Israel not treating all its citizens equally.**

Now in the post I discussed how Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza are treated and people argued that what happens in those areas should not be used to support the argument that ‚ÄúIsrael is an apartheid state‚Äù because:

>*‚ÄúIsrael doesn't govern the West Bank or Gaza Palestinians.‚Äù*

On the surface this seems like a fair counter argument by Zionists but it‚Äôs actually not. Despite how often Zionists try to argue that Israel has no responsibility over the living conditions of occupied territory this is not true.

**The Human Rights Watch, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the UN, and Israel's leading expert on international law Professor Yoram Dinstein of Tel Aviv University have all concluded that Gaza is occupied by Israel and thus responsible for its population.**

And if that isn‚Äôt enough, Israel‚Äôs own Supreme Court ruled in Mara‚Äôabe v. The Prime Minister of Israel that the West Bank is ‚Äúheld by the State of Israel in belligerent occupation. The long arm of the state in the area is the military commander.‚Äù

The Knesset legislates for Palestinians. Israel has extended civilian law into the territory (for some people only), Israel has removed the boundary from many maps‚Äìincluding ones the PM shows.

Israel has a responsibility over the living conditions of the people living in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem whether you like it or not.

Even if we pretend that apartheid is not practiced in Israel proper (which it is, make no mistake,) Israel should still be counted as an apartheid state because of its actions in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.

Now one defense I saw against this is:

>*‚ÄúThe fact of the matter is Israel is not an apartheid state. It enacts apartheid like laws in its occupied territories.*

>*Did you consider America to be an apartheid state following WWII because it occupied Japan and Japanese people in Japan didn't have the same rights as American citizens?‚Äù*

This is a false equivalency, the US didn‚Äôt grab land for exclusive ethnic enclaves in Japan, so never established a system of ethnosupremacism the way Israel has in the West Bank.

Now a Zionist might argue that ‚Äúhaving different laws for the people under a military occupation outside of the countries‚Äô borders has not been considered apartheid for literally any other country in all of history.‚Äù

This would be correct but the key difference is Israel‚Äôs colonization scheme. Other occupations have not confiscated land swaths and sent civilians to settle there‚Äìthe ICJ has deemed these settlements illegal by the way.

The next argument I‚Äôd like to talk about is this one:

>*‚ÄúThe Palestinians need to lay down their arms. They're never going to get the rights they're seeking if the citizens of Israel regard them as a danger. You can't carry on a terror campaign and then seek rights and privileges simultaneously. That will never work, because Israel -- quite understandably -- is always going to prioritize its own safety and security. However good your arguments, they're moot if Israel feels that its people are in danger.‚Äù*

There are two parts I find interesting about this. The first is this part: ‚ÄúThey're never going to get the rights they're seeking if the citizens of Israel regard \[Palestinians\] as a danger.‚Äù

Now, do any Zionists see the problem with this sentence?

I do.

This argument is making a distinction between Palestinians and citizens of Israel even though Palestinians comprise 20% of Israel‚Äôs citizenship.

The second part I find troubling is: ‚Äú\[...\] Israel‚Äìquite understandably‚Äìis always going to prioritize its own safety and security.‚Äù Once again there are millions of Palestinians who are citizens of Israel, Israel isn‚Äôt prioritizing Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúsafety and security‚Äù by oppressing Palestinians, Israel is prioritizing the safety and security of Jewish Israeli citizens.

In my opinion, no country should be for one ethnicity, religion, or race a country should be for all of its citizens. Gandhi once said: ‚Äúthe true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members.‚Äù

In Israel‚Äôs case its most vulnerable members are the millions of Palestinians living within its borders, they control 3% of state land despite making up 20% of the population, 50% of the population lives under the poverty line, their homes are demolished not just in the West Bank but in Israel proper, they can be sued for calling for boycotts, they are intimidated at polling booths due to the Benjamin Netanyahu's party providing activists 1,200 cameras only in Arab communities a move clearly designed to intimidate voters according to Jamil Baransi, deputy mayor of Reineh, seven prisons in Israel have been found committing grueling acts of torture, Israel restricts legal residency in ways that block many Palestinian spouses and families from living together in Israel which according to Amnesty International has made it so tens of thousands of families can not live together, Palestinians face a 99.74% conviction rate, Palestinians have further have been relegated to 165 ""islands"" disconnected from each other by arbitrary roadblocks which restrict freedom of movement. Palestinians aren't allowed to build homes, they require virtually impossible to acquire permits according to Amnesty International and even if Palestinians do manage to build homes Israeli forces bulldoze them.

**What Israel is doing is unconscionable. It shouldn‚Äôt matter that other countries are doing the same thing, or worse things** **you should stand up against Israel‚Äôs actions the same way you would stand up against any country in the Islamic World that does the same thing**\*\*, if you truly care about human lives that is!\*\*

Rapid fire response time:

>*‚ÄúWhy is it important to you to label Israel an ‚Äòapartheid state‚Äô?‚Äù*

I believe that it is important to admit that Israel is an apartheid state because if Israel never accepts that it *is* an apartheid state, if Israel never accepts its problems, Israel will never be able to fix itself and become a better country in the same way that‚Äìfor example‚ÄìAmerica will never be able to improve if it never accepts that systemic racism exists.

>*‚ÄúThe apartheid label is stuck to Israel in a discriminatory fashion, only because it is the ultimate insult.‚Äù*

Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the UN, and the World Court are not calling Israel an apartheid state because they are anti-semitic or because they are pro-Palestine, they are calling Israel an apartheid state because it‚Äôs true.

And if Zionists are so against discrimination then how come they never speak out against Islamophobia? How come Zionists never speak up for the Mizrahi Jews or Ethiopian Israelis who due to the Communities Acceptance Law often find themselves discriminated against in Israel because the admission‚Äôs council of privileged neighborhoods fear that Mizrahi Jews and Ethiopian Israelis will lower the value of their homes?

>*‚ÄúLiterally it‚Äôs the ONLY country in the Middle East where Arabs have any democratic rights.‚Äù*

It‚Äôs true that the Middle East, along with North Africa, is the least democratic region in the world according to International IDEA and the Economist Group‚Äôs Democracy Index said that Israel was the only ‚Äúflawed‚Äù democracy though it specified that in 2023 no country including Israel should be counted as democracies but I am not going to fight against the claim that Israel is a democracy.

So, going off the agreement Israel is often recognized as the only functional democracy in Arabia and the Middle East that still justifies nothing that Israel has done.

Israel being a democracy does not absolve it of any of its failings. Take America, it is widely considered a democracy (you can be pedantic and say it‚Äôs a constitutional republic but I digress) but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt criticize it for how it treats Black people. What Israel is doing is worse than what America is doing and it should be criticized at least as much as America is.

And I find it interesting this comment specifies that it's the only country in the Middle East where Arabs have democratic rights, it's basically saying: ""Arabs need to shut up and be grateful for the few rights that Israel affords them!""

>*‚ÄúIsrael is a democratic, liberal, and open country.‚Äù*

From the top, Israel *is* a parliamentary democracy. This is true and I‚Äôm not going to deny that. However Israel‚Äôs democracy is incredibly flawed according to the Jerusalem based Human Rights group B‚ÄôTselem, Palestinians rights to political participation is under constant attack. As previously mentioned in 2019, Benjamin Netenyahu‚Äôs party hired a PR firm to intimidate voters in Arab communities, and **In 2014, the Knesset raised the electoral threshold which means the percentage of votes needed for parliamentary representation raised from 2% to 3.25% this spurred a condemnation by the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination saying:** **\[The move\] would considerably weaken the right to political participation of non-Jewish minorities.**

The flaws in Israel‚Äôs democracy should not be ignored!

*(as for the claim of Israel being a liberal country I might discuss that in another post because I have so much to say.)*

I realize that Israel has committed horrible crimes, alongside Hamas, but for some reason i can feel a sort of bias within me to side with Israel, even though it had committed such crimes. I dont believe that Israel should take over Palestine, or vice versa and commit genocide, but i just can't shake the bias. I don't believe Israel is a paragon of morality, nor is Hamas 'freedom Fighters' the Nova party proved that for me, but for some reason i always try to side with Israel even if i later find out they did someone wrong. 

I don't know if its because of my feelings to the protesters? I mean, i've only seen students at Ivy Leagues do encampments refusing to go to fucking school, or a bunch of people on the streets yelling at people who pass to free Palestine. Same with a few videos of them yelling at literal cancer treatment plazas, plus the whole Boycott on all Israeli/jewish shit. 

But again, Israel isn't innocent, they've been occupying the west bank, and Golan heights for a long time, even when writing this I'm trying to be like, ""to be fair, they were invaded first"" but that just feels like it feeds back into my loop of ""Israel is more moral or righteous than Palestine"" Can someone please explain this shit to me?

For the sake of argument, let‚Äôs assume that the actions of the resistance, such as kidnapping, were wrong. Why should over 2 million people face torture, killing, rape, and burning?

Why are NICUs and hospitals bombed? Why are the elderly shot by snipers simply because they are older than the occupiers in Palestine? Why have more than 150 scientists and scholars, whose names and credentials I know, been assassinated? Why are mosques and churches bombed? Why are historical sites destroyed? Why have all the universities been obliterated? 

Why are ICU departments targeted? Why has the Israeli army's terrorist force killed 2,100 infants and toddlers under the age of two, out of around 17,000 children in Gaza since the beginning of this genocide? Why do brutal soldiers laugh as a dog tear apart a child with Down syndrome? Why do they murder families, leaving a child alive to suffer alone after forcing him to watch every member of his family getting killed?

 Have you seen the faces of freed Palestinian prisoners? The horror is written in their eyes and on their faces! You may compare them with the face of the freed hostages by the resistance to see how gently and kindly they were treated, that even one of them left a gratitude letter to Hamas for the kind treatment!! 

Why have so many died of hunger and thirst? Why bomb shelter areas and safe zones they themselves designated? Why use children as human shields in front of Merkava tanks? 

Is this all in response to kidnappings? Does that justify killing over 40,000 innocent people and leveling an entire country with TNT bombs that have exceeded the TNT used in Nagasaki and which have created 40 million tons of debris! Experts say it will take 14 years to clear, according to The Guardian. Can you even imagine this?

1fichet,The Jews resettling the Gaza Strip in Palestine,2024-09-16 18:46:37,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fichet/the_jews_resettling_the_gaza_strip_in_palestine/,"A few months ago when I was attending a party at my cousin sister's place, I remember reading this news on my mobile phone: [https://www.timesofisrael.com/ben-gvir-calls-to-encourage-emigration-resettle-gaza-at-ultra-nationalist-rally/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/ben-gvir-calls-to-encourage-emigration-resettle-gaza-at-ultra-nationalist-rally/) Ben Gvir, Smotrich, and many others have been calling for resettling the Gaza Strip. There have been many other rallies as well, which Netanyahu has avoided attending.



I also fondly remember the painful days when Gush Katif had to be evacuated in 2005 and those Jews who lived in paradise with beaches and greenhouses had to be uprooted. What has it brought about? Nothing but misery with tens of thousands of rockets and finally Oct 7th. 



After building up Philadelphia and Netzarim, I hope the Jews can go back and live in the communities of Gush Katif and Rafiah Yam once again. I do understand that many Israelis may not want to go there again: [https://www.timesofisrael.com/almost-4-in-10-israelis-back-a-revival-of-jewish-settlements-in-gaza-poll-finds/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/almost-4-in-10-israelis-back-a-revival-of-jewish-settlements-in-gaza-poll-finds/), but the numbers are increasing. Whoever doesn't want to go there needn't. Even someone who is very moderate like the Hebron Rabbi Yishai Fleisher has supported the idea. Since Hamas is being eradicated soon with its battalions completely wiped out in Rafah and northern parts of Gaza, the area would be very safe as well. 



Nevertheless, I'm also interested in hearing from this community, what do people think here? Should the Jews be able to go back and live in the Gaza Strip as a step forward to peace in the region?"

I am sick and tired of good tax payer money being exported to Israel in the name of providing arms to Israel. This money could be put towards local problems and issues; rather than the Palestinian Genocide and Ethnic cleansing.

Instead your money could be put to causes you truly care about like: the NHS, new roads, benefits for the needy and disabled, reduced university fees, free school meals and much more which a social welfare state will help people access. The millions of pound sent to Gaza is enough money to reform the NHS by training over 2581 doctors (It costs on average ¬£220,000 to train a doctor according to the BBC).

Now is the time to act due to increasing strain on families and the growing awareness of the Palestinian cause as Israel starts to attack Rafah which is meant to be a temporary safe zone for the people of Palestine. This puts us at an all time urgency to take action and condemn the IDF. Especially seen as we have licensed ¬£576 million in Arms to Israel since 2008 and granted 108 licenses to Israel between October the 7th and the end of May source is the British commons library. 

The Israeli government is well known to use these as a means of mass murder and genocide this is clearly in part thanks to western weapons which have stricken innocent homes in Gaza even as we near the 1 year anniversary of the October 7th attacks in this long lasting war of over 75 years.

The reason I ask this is because the death toll for Palestinians is much higher than Israelis. While Israelis have suffered alot in this war, Palestinians have suffered as well. They have lost homes and loved ones in this horrible conflict as well, just on a larger scale. I don't mean to offend any Israelis here, I just want your opinions on this.

1fi6l0b,Palestine was never ever a country,2024-09-16 14:50:42,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fi6l0b/palestine_was_never_ever_a_country/,"""Palestine was never ever a country. It was only called the British Mandate of Palestine. And Israel never ever invaded it. The Jews were living in the land for 2000 years before Islam was even created, and Jews were living on the land for 3500 years uninterrupted. 

Many fled the Romans and Byzantines and others who invaded and massacred our people. The Muslims invaded and massacred us and the Muslims have always been the occupiers. 

As for the land just before 1948, much of it was barren land, uninhabited because it was afflicted by malaria and desert and arid conditions. The Arabs did nothing with it. 

It wasn‚Äôt until the Jews brought teams of scientists and agricultural experts in the 1910s that they began major projects of afforestation and cleaning up the malaria epidemic. 

They drained the swamps and built dams and towns and farms and vast fields of green. It was the Jewish National Fund founded in 1901 that began to legally purchase land from the Arabs and the Ottoman Empire and then turn the land from desert to lush green pastures. That‚Äôs a historical fact. 

It was the Jews who built Ahuzat Bayit in 1909 and later renamed it Tel Aviv a year later. We turned it from sand dunes to a paradise. The Arabs had nothing to do with building the land and towns and cities and ports and schools and farmland etc.

So no, the land wasn‚Äôt empty. It was filled with sand and rocks and malaria-infested swamps until the Jews turned it into something wonderful. 

And because the Jews developed it and purchased land and more Jews started to come, the Arabs led by Amin Al Husseini hated the Jews and attacked them with pogroms between 1920 and 1937.

Thousands of Jews were massacred and burned alive. 

 Then in 1937, after 17 years of being murdered by the Arabs, the Jewish paramilitary group Irgun started to hit back here and there in retaliation and to defend Jewish communities being attacked by the Arabs. 

Then Al Husseini did the unimaginable and allied with Hitler to totally exterminate the Jews. And the Arabs attacked and attacked and Irgun began to fight back. 

Then in 1947, the British handed over the mandate to the UN and the UN published their partition plan. This was after the Arabs already lobbied and attacked the British and threatened more attacks and the British giving them 80% of the land promised to the Jews to create Jordan in 1946. 

And the partition plan would give the Jews 56% of the 20% remaining land, or basically just 10% of what was promised to them. And still the Jews accepted it. Mist if that 56% was again almost uninhabitable and the Jews would turn that to green land as well. 

But the Arabs rejected the partition plan and waged a civil war in November 1947. That war was fought until May 1948. It wasn‚Äôt until April 1948 that the Jews finally had a chance because they defeated the Arab militias and many Arabs began to flee. 

Then the armies of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and Saudi gathered together and demanded all the Arabs on the land to leave so that only Jews remained, allowing them to come in a wipe us all out. And most of the Arabs left because they were told to. The Jews had asked them to stay - FACT!! 

And a day after Israel was declared independent on 14 May 1948, it was the Arab armies who waged a genocidal war on Israel‚Ä¶ and Israel won in 1949. There was NO Nakba. That is an Arab lie. The Jews even invited many Arabs who left to come back, but they refused. It was then that the UN invented UNRWA, and the rest is history. 

The Arabs attacked and waged wars several times since and Israel won every time. And the Arabs have played the victims ever since. 

It‚Äôs the Arabs who started EVERY war. And lost every war. And the Arabs are the occupiers and the aggressors.

And now here we are, with the Arabs still trying to exterminate the Jews. But now we have the IDF and we can fight back. 

That is the history.""

1fi5vaz,How can Zionists say Israel isn't an apartheid state? It clearly is. Let's stop lying.,2024-09-16 14:20:50,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fi5vaz/how_can_zionists_say_israel_isnt_an_apartheid/,"The Nation-State Bill is an Israeli Basic Law passed by the Knesset in 2018.

The bill states:

>**1 ‚Äî¬†Basic Principles**  
\[...\]  
C. The right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people.

And,

>**7 ‚Äî¬†Jewish Settlement**

>A.¬†The state views the development of Jewish Settlement as a national value and will act to encourage and promote its establishment and consolidation.



Now onto the actual discussion:  
What is apartheid?

The various conventions and statues concerning the crime of apartheid vary in terms of language but they all agree on three features all apartheid regimes have.

1. An institutionalized regime of systemic racial oppression and discrimination.
2. The regime must have been founded with the intent to maintain the domination of one racial group over another.
3. The regime must feature inhumane and inhuman acts committed as an integral part of the regime.

I think we can all agree to this definition, now let's proceed.  


A common defense against Israel being an apartheid state is: ""1\\5th of Israel citizens are Palestinian--and these citizens can vote and hold office, they enjoy all the same freedoms as their Jewish-Israeli neighbors therefore Israel is not a apartheid state.""

Ignoring the Palestinians living in Israeli occupied lands, let's talk about how Israel treats the two million living in Israel proper.

In 1948, 750,000 Arabs vanished from what is now the state of Israel, for argument's sake let's pretend they weren't expelled and left on their own. With all of these Palestinians gone, Israel begins a systematic  of destruction Palestinian homes through demolition and forestation (the planting of tree in villages making them uninhabitable) Haaertz reported on this process using declassified Israeli documents here: [https://www.haaretz.com/2019-05-27/ty-article/.premium/israel-lifted-military-rule-over-arabs-in-1966-only-after-ensuring-they-couldnt-ret/0000017f-e0fd-d804-ad7f-f1ff86630000](https://www.haaretz.com/2019-05-27/ty-article/.premium/israel-lifted-military-rule-over-arabs-in-1966-only-after-ensuring-they-couldnt-ret/0000017f-e0fd-d804-ad7f-f1ff86630000)

The destruction of the homes ensured that the Palestinians had no place to return to (even if we assume the Palestinians left on their own by destroying their homes Israel still forced displaced them under International Law but let's all ignore that.)

An example of how this all looked let's use the example of the northern village of Iqrit, the people living there  were ordered to leave their village by the Israeli military, and the Iqrit people relocated to another village but were never allowed to return to their home. Eventually the Iqrit people sued for the right to return, and the Supreme Court ruled in their favor but the Israeli Ministry of Defense refused to implement the decision fearing it would create a precedent for the return of other Palestinians forced out. And in 1951 the Ministry of Defense blew up all remaining homes in Iqrit.

In 1950s the state of Israel passed the Absentee Property Law which the state used to claim all the land of all the Palestinians who had fled their homes because of the war regardless of whether they were internally or externally displaced and to this day they are still prohibited from accessing and using the lands or property which belonged to their family in 1948.

And in the first 16 years of Israel's existence Palestinians living within Israel's borders living in its borders were placed under military rule and the state used emergency powers to confiscate properties and close entire villages relegating the Palestinians to dozens of enclaves which they required permits to leave.

Israel banned protests and political parties and Palestinians were tried in military courts instead of regular courts.

According to Haaertz using information from declassified Israeli documents:

>Israel lifted its military rule over the state's Arab community in 1966 only after ascertaining that its members could not return to the villages they had fled or been expelled from \[...\]

By the time military rule was lifted Israel had already completed its initiative of destroying Palestinians homes and making them unlivable.

Today Arabs control just 3% of state land despite making up 20% of the population. The 90% of Palestinians who live in these areas experience higher rates of poverty, lower levels of labor force participation, educational attainment and health than Jewish Israelis.

50% of the Arab population lives below the poverty line!

Only 2% of industrial zones in Israel which generate a significant tax income are located in these Palestinian areas.

The other 10% of Palestinians live in so-called ""mixed cities"" but even then are usually relegated to separate neighborhoods.

""But why don't they move?"" you may ask. Well, because unlike most industrialized countries Israel controls 93% of the land either directly or indirectly through quasi-national bodies such as the Jewish National Fund. And in 2011 the Knesset passed the ""Communities Acceptance Law"" which established admissions committees in Jewish communities to screen applicants based on their ""social suitability"" or ""the candidate's lack of compatibility with the social-cultural fabric of the community."" As you can imagine this vague wording allows for much discrimination primarily against Arabs (but also against Mizrahi Jews and Ethiopian Israelis or really anyone the residents of the privileged communities fear will lower the value of their homes.)

The law stipulated that admission councils were limited to villages with four-hundred residents though this rule was repeatedly broken and in 2023 the law was expanded to towns with a thousand residents.

Today admissions committees operate in 53 Regional Councils which control 81% of state land in Israel meaning Arab are, in practice, bared from leasing land in 80% of Israel.

For more than fifteen years the residents of Umm al-Hiran have been waging a legal battle to save their village which is scheduled for demolition. Israeli forces attempted to forcibly evacuate the village and began destroying homes however they had to pause the incident due to a scandal where they killed a man named Yakub Abu Alan and then tried to suppress evidence, but the plan has been resumed since 2022.

In the place of Umm al-Hiran will be a new village called Hiran. Hiran's cooperative association bylaws states:

>""An individual may be approved by the admission's committee and become a member of the Hiran cooperative association if they meet the following qualifications: a Jewish Israeli citizen or permanent resident of Israel who observes the Torah and commandments according to Orthodox Jewish values.""

A similar fate awaits the people who live in the thousands of homes of South Israel which are being demolished every year.

Home demolitions don't just occur in the West Bank but Israel proper as well, and attempts to challenge these laws and uphold Palestinian rights are met with further difficulties as in Israel political parties are illegal if they *deny the existence of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state* (under the 1992 law on political parties.)

Under the 1958 Knesset Basic Law any political candidate can be disqualified for:

>Negation of the State of Israel as the state of the Jewish people.

In Israel BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) is out of the question, and though not criminal to call for a boycott under the 2011 boycott law you are legally open to civil suits and sanctions. 

Also in 2011 the Knesset approved ""Fundamental of Finance Amendment Number 40"" which has been called the ""Nakba Law"" and under this law the state can withhold funding for government institutions that commemorate the Nakba.

Further limitations on Free Speech can be found in the Knesset's rules of procedures which states:

>The Knesset Presidium shall not approve a bill that in its opinion *denies the existence of the State of Israel as the state of the Jewish People*, or is racist in its essence.

This makes it so Palestinian lawmakers cannot challenge laws that codify Jewish Israeli domination over the Palestinian minority.

Further barriers for political representation have been made aside from the suppression of Free Speech. In 2014, the Knesset raised the electoral threshold which means the percentage of votes needed for parliamentary representation raised from 2% to 3.25% this spurred a condemnation by the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination saying:

>\[The move\] would considerably weaken the right to political participation of non-Jewish minorities.

According to Jerusalem based Human Rights group B'Tselem Palestinian rights to political participation is under *constant attack!*

During the 2019 elections Benjamin Netanyahu's party provided activists 1,200 cameras only in Arab communities. This move was clearly designed to intimidate voters according to Jamil Baransi, deputy mayor of Reineh.

After the election, the PR firm behind the operation boasted on FaceBook about dropping voter turnout to under 50%, the lowest seen in recent years. And the head of the PR firm had previously said: ""Arabs are sitting alone in the polling stations, we don't trust them. We let them vote in our country even though it's our country, they should at least vote truthfully.""

Palestinian-Israeli citizens political history is fraught with violence, especially during the Second Intifada, the violent crackdown by Israeli forces was *not* limited to the occupied territories in fact 13 Palestinians were killed in Israel proper and over 1,000 arrested.

Disparities in justice also prevail with Palestinians often being put in pre-trial detention while Israeli Jews get bail.

Desmond Tutu the South African bishop who earned a noble prize due to their anti-apartheid activism wrote in 2014:

>I know firsthand that Israel has created an apartheid reality within its borders and through its occupation. The parallels to my own beloved South Africa are painfully stark indeed.

In 2022, Michael Lynk the then Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories concluded in a report that Israel was practicing apartheid. In its list of inhumane and inhuman acts committed as part of the regime was the Citizenship Law which restricts Palestinian Israeli from marrying individuals from the West Ban and Gaza, *this does not apply to Israeli Jews.*

The list also discusses the torture practiced in Israel (methods include: Sleep deprivation, beating and slapping, humiliation, unhygienic conditions, and extended shackling in contorted positions.)

Seven prisons in Israel were found to commit grueling torture by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel. And here's an excerpt from Amnesty International's report on apartheid in Israel:

>Amnesty International has examined specifically the inhumane acts of forcibly transfer, administrative detention and torture, unlawful killings and serious injuries, and the denial of basic freedoms or persecution committed against the Palestinian population in Israel and the \[Occupied Palestinian Territories.\]

Here's an excerpt from the Human Rights Watch's report:

>Sepretely from the inhumane acts carried out in the \[Occupied Palestinian Territories,\] the Israeli government has carried out abuse against Palestinians within Israel, including:  
-Refusing to allow Palestinians access to the millions of dunams of land that were confiscated from them.  
-Not permitting more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled in 1948 and their descendants to return to Israel.  
-Restricting legal residency in ways that block many Palestinian spouses and families from living together in Israel.

As a result of that third part tens of thousands of families have been unable to live together, according to Amnesty International, this is profoundly discriminatory.

Supposedly this is for security reasons, but when this law was enacted in 2003 the then Interior Minister Avraham Poraz explained:

>A decision was reached at the time that for now, family unification would cease as it was felt it would be exploited to achieve a creeping right of return \[...\] That is, tens of thousands of Palestinian Arabs are coming into Israel.

B'Tselem in its list of ways in which Israel advances Jewish supremacy includes immigration noting that while any Jew in the world and his or her children, grandchildren and spouses are entitled to immigrate to Israel at any time and receive citizenship, Palestinians living in other countries can not even if they, their parents, or grandparents lived their. They added: ""Taking over land for Jews while crowding Palestinians in enclaves"" stating that Israel ""practices a policy of 'Judazing' the area, based on the mindset that land is a resource based almost exclusively to benefit the Jewish public.""

Indeed the current transportation minister even publicly used this language: ""I intend to Judaize the Galilee"" (https://www.palestinechronicle.com/israeli-transportation-minister-i-intend-to-judaize-the-galilee/)

Israel uses the land it takes to build hundreds of communities for its Jewish citizens but not one for its Palestinian citizens. B'Tselem concluded in their report on Israeli apartheid:

>Israel demographically engineers the space through laws and orders that allow any Jew in the world or their relatives Israeli citizenship but almost completely deny the Palestinians this opportunity.

A regime that uses laws, practices, and organized violence to cement the supremacy of one group over another is an apartheid regime.

And let's remember the Palestinians living in Israel have it best. The situation becomes worse in terms of quality of life and human rights in the following order: East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and without a doubt Gaza.

As Amnesty International's report says:

>The very existence of these separate legal regimes, however, is one of the main tools through which Israel fragments Palestinians and enforces its system of oppression and domination.

As a 2017 UN report on Israeli apartheid puts it the different legal rights afforded to different sectors ""serve to enfeeble opposition to \[apartheid\] and to veil its very existence.""

The same report refers to Palestinians in Israel as ""Domain 1"" which serves: ""To sustain the myth that one portion of the Palestinian people enjoys the full benefits of democracy"" as the report puts it.

If the Palestinians who live in Israel themselves are relegated to second-class citizenship and abused and persecuted against one can only imagine how bad the situation is in all the other domains (East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza.) Zionists may argue that the living conditions of occupied territory is not Israel's responsibility even though Israel's Supreme Court has ruled itself that the West Bank is ""held by the State of Israel in belligerent occupation. The long arm of the state in the area is the military commander."" (That's from the court case Mara'abe v. The Prime Minister of Israel.)

Gaza is also not free from Israeli control, according to the UN it enforces a ""medieval military blockade"" with Israel controlling imports, exports, export taxes and Gaza's territorial waters and airspace and has blocked the building of an airport and seaport. Furthermore Israel controls electricity lines in Gaza and the underwater cable phone calls are placed on, the network that provides the internet, and the frequencies assigned to Palestinian cell phone companies. (From the Human Rights Watch report.)

There's a reason the Human Rights Watch, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the UN, and Israel's leading expert on international law Professor Yoram Dinstein of Tel Aviv University have all concluded that Gaza is occupied by Israel and thus responsible for its population.

Israel has failed considerably at looking after the wellbeing of its Gazan population with Michael Lynk reporting in 2022 that Gaza had undergone a multi-decade process of de-development and deindustrialization resulting in a 45% unemployment rate and a 60% poverty rate with 80% of the population dependent on *international* assistance.

As B'Tselem concludes: ""Israel has continued to control nearly every aspect of life in Gaza from outside."" But none of the Palestinians living in these lands that Israel controls can vote in elections, they have no political rights. A Israeli Jew can live with full citizenship and benefits in the West Bank while a Palestinian doesn't have citizenship.

Israeli Jews go to civil court, Palestinians go to military court and face a over 99.74% conviction rate.

Hundreds of Palestinians are held without any charges at all and can be held indefinitely.

Political and legal rights differ depending on race in Israel.

Israel is unequal.

Palestinian political parties and demonstrations are illegal.

Palestinians in the West Bank are governed by more than eighteen-hundred military orders pertaining to taxation, transportation, land planning and zoning, natural resources, including water. Israel controls all the water going into occupied territories.

In Gaza, before Oct. 7th, OCHA found that 97% of the water was already found unfit for human consumption and the equipment with which to treat the water was banned by the strict blockade of the strip. Gaza was already suffering from a water crisis. 

The Oslo agreement stipulated that 80% of water in the West Bank would be diverted for Israeli use despite the fact the Israeli population numbers around 100,000 and the Palestinian population numbers around one million. Oslo provided Israelis with a unlimited water supply while Palestinians were restricted to a pre-determined amount, West Bank residents will attempt to supplement their water on their own but the military prevents from  building water insulations without getting a virtually unobtainable permit from the army. They aren't even allowed to deepen pre-existing wells and are denied access to the Jordan River and freshwater springs. Israel even controls the collection of rain water through in most of the West Bank, the military destroys rain water harvesting cisterns owned by Palestinian communities often, that's just terrible.

Palestinians in the West Bank are routinely murdered by soldiers and civilians alike with impunity according to Michael Lynk UN Report.

Palestinians have further have been relegated to 165 ""islands"" disconnected from each other by arbitrary roadblocks which restrict freedom of movement.

Palestinians aren't allowed to build homes, they require virtually impossible to acquire permits according to Amnesty International and even if Palestinians do manage to build homes Israeli forces bulldoze them. 

These realities made Michael Lynk imply that what is happening in Israel is worse than what was happening in South Africa.

I leave with this quote from Human Rights Watch:

>Every day a person is born in Gaza into a open-air prison, in the West Bank without civil rights, in Israel with an inferior status by law, and in neighboring countries condemned to lifelong refugee status, like their parents and grandparents before them, solely because they were born Palestinian and not Jewish."

I completely believe that both sides, individual civilians wise, want nothing but to live peacefully (not including psychos on both sides).
This naggy discussion, mostly globally, ""LOOK I FOUND AN OLD COIN THAT SAYS PALESTINE!"" ""OH LOOK HERES A MAP THAT SAYS ISRAEL!"" leads nowhere. The fact is there are Palestinian people here, and there are Israeli people here, and no one is going anywhere. Saying that palestinians or Israelis are a ""made up nation"" is the dumbest thing in my opinion. Every nation is made up.
I admit, in the beginning of the war, I also started arguing with people that Israelis were here first, and they have a right on this land, but now I view it as completely dumb. I understand people from Israel or Palestine who get defensive about it online, but people from outside who argue about it astonish me. What will you prove? That Israelis are annoying Jews who came to terrorise innocent Arabs? Or that Palestinians just decided to become a nation to annoy innocent Jews? So what? They should all just... Move? They won't. The history is way too complicated for a definite answer, and even if it wasn't, it doesn't matter. We should argue for peace and the ways to achieve it. Not an endless racist slop."

This idea is probably just because we're in the Middle East.

Gaza holds around 1 TCF (30 BCM) of natural gas, but no oil

Israel, on the other hand, has 35 TCF (1,087 BCM) of natural gas, though limited oil reserves
[link](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/israels-fossil-fuel-boon-becomes-less-clear-cut-2023-10-19/.)

The West Bank is reported to have 1.5 billion barrels of oil (BBO). This long boring UN article provides an optimistic outlook on the potential economic benefits
[link](https://unctad.org/webflyer/economic-costs-israeli-occupation-palestinian-people-unrealized-oil-and-natural-gas.)

While these reserves are substantial, they pale in comparison to the UAE's production. The UAE produces 1.5 BBO and 50 BCM of natural gas every six months and holds an estimated 6,000 BCM of gas and 100 BBO in reserves. 
Neighboring countries like Saudi and Iran have much larger reserves. 
The oil and gas reserves in Israel and Palestine are worth about the same as 1-2 years of the UAE's GDP. 

The resources are significant for the region and worth looking into for Palestine and Gaza's economy, but they don't seem transformative.

There is also unconventional shale gas under Israel and minerals in the dead sea. But nothing too exciting. Am I missing something?

As far as I see the important resources of the region are it's history and people"
1fhtpp0,It's likely that the polio outbreak we're seeing in Gaza was actually caused by UNICEF and the WHO,2024-09-16 02:14:36,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fhtpp0/its_likely_that_the_polio_outbreak_were_seeing_in/,"I know this sounds like anti-vax nonsense, but suspend your disbelief for a minute...

The current outbreak has been confirmed to be ""circulating **vaccine-derived** poliovirus type 2"" (cVDPV2). ([Source](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1153166))

The normal protocol for vaccinating children against polio is to give 3 doses of IPV (Inactivated Polio Virus) before 18 months of age and a booster between 4 and 6 years. However, WHO and UNICEF went in in ~~[Fall 2023](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/around-560-000-children-vaccinated-first-round-polio-campaign-gaza)~~ Fall 2023 [(1)](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/thousands-doses-childhood-vaccines-enter-gaza-palestinian-health-ministry-2024-01-01/) [(2)](https://www.unicef.org/sop/stories/delivering-life-saving-vaccines-every-child-gaza-strip) providing **OPV** (Oral Polio Vaccine), which contains a weak, but live, poliovirus intended to trigger an immune response without causing the disease. Note that OPV is more effective at preventing transmission in an ongoing outbreak and less about absolute prevention, as OPV works in the gut and IPV works in the central nervous system.

The problem with OPV is there are additional risks: it contains an active virus, which can survive, mutate, and [cause](https://www.immunize.org/ask-experts/topic/polio/) cVDPV polio. While the studies show it to be a rare complication, those studies tend not to happen in war-torn areas like Gaza. Additionally, incomplete dosing not only contributes to cVDPV developing, but it also increases community transmission. Children may lack the immunity to the weakened virus and both the CDC and WHO highlight the fact that **incomplete vaccination coverage is the primary factor in cVDPV2 outbreaks**. ([Source 1](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7214a3.htm)) ([Source 2](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/hcp/vaccine-derived-poliovirus-faq.html)) ([Source 3](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus-type-2-global-update)) ([Source 4](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6845a4.htm))

Why use OPV at all? Because its cheap. It's used across the poorer sections of the world (for example, the US has exclusively administered IPV since 2000).

Putting it all together, it looks like UNICEF and the WHO was administering OPV vaccinations in Gaza in late 2023 and (to the shock of everyone) people tend not to keep doctors appointments during an active war. They knew the risks when doing it. they knew that it was giving OPV to children who would, very likely, miss their next OPV vaccination. They did it anyway.

Instead of blaming Israel for this outbreak (and everything), how about UNICEF and the WHO own up to exactly what they did: they decided to take actions they knew would likely result in a vaccine-derived polio outbreak in Gaza and didn't tell or warn anyone?? That whatever is happening with polio in Gaza today is something they should've foreseen *months* ago. That had it not been for their prior actions, we wouldn't be seeing this cVDPV2 outbreak today.

And to put a period on this, Gaza had been ""Polio-free"" for 25 years prior to October 2023.

Edit: 

1. It's possible that current vaccine-derived polio variant that is circulating emanated from Egypt. (Thanks /u/ThanksToDenial) 

  > [On 16 July 2024, wastewater test results confirmed that cVDPV2 was detected in six samples collected on 23 June 2024 from Khan Younis and Deir al Balah ES sites in the Gaza Strip.

Benny Morris, Forcibly Expelled 250,000‚Äì300,000, Voluntarily Left 300,000‚Äì400,000

Ilan Papp√©, expelled: 350,000‚Äì400,000, Voluntarily Left 300,000‚Äì350,000

Yoav Gelber, expelled 200,000‚Äì300,000, voluntarily left 400,000‚Äì500,000

According to some historians like Yoav Gelber about 100/400 villages ‚Äúdepopulated‚Äù posed some kind of military threat. There were no centralized orders to expel these groups from what I read and it was often left at the discretion of some Israeli military commanders. There were also concerns that the population in these villages would be loyal to the Arab armies and pose a future security threat. 

Around 1% of Israel‚Äôs population was killed during this military invasion by neighbouring Arab countries. 1500-2000 Jews were also expelled from the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem, Hebron and Gush Etzion. Jewish synagogues and homes were also burned in the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem and they were not allowed to return until the end of the 1967 war. According to some sources 10,000-20,000 Jews were displaced during the conflict.

The displacement of civilians during wars of independence and military conflicts are not uncommon. For example:

-after world war 2 around 10 million German civilians were expelled and 500,000-1mil were killed or died due to harsh conditions during this expulsions. 

-1.5 million Greeks were expelled from Turkey and 500,000 Turks were expelled from
Greece at the end of the Greco-Turkish war (1923). 

-10-15 million people were displaced or left during the Indian-Pakistan partition (1947)

-200,000 Algerians fled or were expelled during the war of independence 

-2.2 million Bosnians were expelled or fled during the Bosnian war 

It seems that there‚Äôs only political pressure on the Jews to allow the descendants of these refugees to return and Israeli is falsely portrayed as a nation of Jewish supremacists. 

18-20% of Palestinians remained in the newly formed country of Israel despite the recent military conflict. Prior to the war the UN partition plan (1947) which was accepted by the Jews would have also had 55% Jews and 45% Arabs. Israel‚Äôs deceleration of independence gave these Arabs equal rights. The notion that the conflict began because Jews did not want to live with their Arab neighbours or believed they are superior is absurd. "
1fgwaie,"I'll tell you an interesting facts about the name ""Palestine.""",2024-09-14 21:22:03,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fgwaie/ill_tell_you_an_interesting_facts_about_the_name/,"I'll tell you an interesting facts about the name ""Palestine.""
Warning: It's as interesting as it is shocking, but facts are facts and there's no other way around it. If you don't like it, you just have to put up with it.
Let's start with the movie...

The map calls what is now Israel ""Palestine"" because Raiders of the Lost Ark takes place in 1936, and at that time, the region was a British colony called the British Mandate of Palestine. So the movie is historically accurate.

Now take note: the name Palestine was not given because there was a Palestinian nation, a Palestinian country, or a Palestinian people ""sovereign in their own land."" It was called that BECAUSE IT WAS A COLONY. THE BRITISH gave it that name.

But then WHAT WAS IT CALLED BEFORE?
You may be surprised, but it was NOT called Palestine. In fact, it did not exist as a province. The area was divided into small provinces, some governed from Beirut, others from Damascus.

There it is called Palestine, but only because the map is from an English book. The Ottomans (who ruled the region at the time) did not call it that.
In fact, NO Islamic domain called it Palestine in the sense of a country, province or nation.

For Muslims, Filast√≠n was only a regional name that served as an alternative to the ""Holy Land."" Why? Because that was the name given to it by the Romans before the Arab conquest. That is why Muslims were never interested in the name.

Technically, the region was always seen by Islam as a mere extension of Sham (Syria), although for administrative reasons the coastal regions were governed from Beirut.
For Islam there NEVER existed a country called Palestine with a people called Palestinians.

The first Muslims who began to speak of Palestine in official terms were the Ottomans, right in the middle of the 19th century.
But look at the reasons for this: at that time, the English presence had increased significantly in the region.

Political crises in the area during the 1830s put the Ottoman authorities at risk. Mehmet Ali, the governor of Egypt, took control of the region and had serious plans to attack Istanbul. He might have succeeded, but the English intervened.

Unable to confront the British army after a fierce bombardment of Beirut, Ali returned to Cairo, and the Ottomans regained control of the area. Ties with England were thus strengthened, and the British consulate was then granted several privileges.

One of them was that all Europeans residing in the ""Holy Land"" were placed under British jurisdiction. Most Jews benefited from this same provision. Thus, although they lived in Ottoman territory, they were governed by English laws.

This legal curiosity - British jurisdiction in Ottoman territory - was what the Ottomans themselves called Palestine. That is, they themselves understood the concept of ""Palestine"" to be something shared by Christians and Jews, but alien to Islam.

Why?
Simple: because in the sacred narrative of Islam, Palestine has no importance. The only place that stands out is Jerusalem, called Al-Quds (The Holy). But this special status is limited to the city and its surroundings, not to the entire territory.

However, in Jewish and Christian religious narratives, the regions of Judea, Samaria and Galilee have a capital importance because they are where the history of ancient Israel takes place, or where Jesus of Nazareth walked.

In 135, Emperor Hadrian ordered a name change and these three provinces were renamed Palestine. But it was just that: a name change. Conceptually, the idea was not altered for either Jews or Christians.

In the 19th century, when a Jew or a Christian spoke of Palestine, he understood the concept perfectly. Muslims did not. For them, the name was only an anachronistic geographical reference, foreign to their religion.

Now, if Muslims did not imagine the existence of Palestine as something concrete, EVEN LESS so did they imagine the existence of a ""Palestinian people"" as something equally concrete. The inhabitants there were simply Arabs or Shamis Muslims. That is, Syrians.

So much so that even in the 20th century, Haffez el-Assad, the Syrian dictator (father of Bashar el-Assad) insisted that Israel had to be destroyed, and the territory incorporated into Syria, because ""THAT HAD BEEN THE WAY IT HAD BEEN THROUGHOUT HISTORY"".

So do not be fooled, readers of good will.
When pro-Palestinians present you with ""evidence"" that this place was once called Palestine, remind them that this only happened after 1834, and it was thanks to the British and the Jews."
1fgtbqk,Democrats fear Hezbollah sleeper cells,2024-09-14 19:03:10,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fgtbqk/democrats_fear_hezbollah_sleeper_cells/,"One overlooked reason as to why the US government is pushing so strongly against a major operation in Lebanon, is that Hezbollah likely has sleeper cells in the United States. 

American intel is warning against the possibility of attacks within the United states by Hezbollah and stating that Hezbollah's capabilities is likely stronger than ISIS, and while those groups might be able to commit lone wolf shootings, Hezbollah might actually be able to conduct an efficient terror campaign. 

[https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/10/american-intel-officials-hezbollah-u-s-attack-risk-00134874](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/10/american-intel-officials-hezbollah-u-s-attack-risk-00134874)

Hezbollah's presence in Latin America has long been connected to drug trafficking. But because of Iran's close connections with Venezuela, they likely have a military presence in the continent as well. 

This creates not just a problem for the democrats on national security, but also politically, as Republicans will hammer democrats for failing on the border and allowing terrorists to set up cells in America. This might be why Israel is waiting with the war in Lebanon, because if a Hezbollah terror wave grips the US, the democrats will suffer massively politically. 

The problem is though, that Israel might not have time to wait until November, Hezbollah knows it is in an existential war with Israel as well, and that their prospects likely will worsen after the election as there will be less pressure on the Biden/Harris to stop the war for electoral reasons. It is likely that Hezbollah would benefit more if the war started now, rather than later, since the pressure for democrats is now and not later. 

One argument against a Hezbollah campaign inside the US is that it might damage their drug trade, and the revenue is too valuable to risk, but Hezbollah are not ODC‚Äôs (Ordinary Decent Criminals) they are hardcore believers and have killed Americans before, like Beirut barracks. 

Another argument would also be that Hezbollah would turn the American public against them with a terror campaign, however, they have realized that both sides of the isle will support Israel against Hezbollah regardless, and therefore have more to lose by being passive, Hezbollah also have less empathy than the Palestinians and are unlikely to see any college encampments for their survival. I think these elements make a Hezbollah campaign in the US, primarily against civilian targets a big possibility if Israel broadens the campaign "
1fgobzr,Is Yesh Din considered a credible source in Israel? Is it true only 0.87% of soldiers were indicted for complaints against them? ,2024-09-14 15:13:53,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fgobzr/is_yesh_din_considered_a_credible_source_in/,"
Sorry if this post is provocative. I am pro Israel but I‚Äôm just curious about understanding the situation of settler violence and other forms of violence better in the West Bank. The only information available seems to come from activist groups or the UN so I was just wondering how frequently settlers and soldiers actually get prosecuted for attacks against Palestinians and how frequently they occur. 

I know there are many active terrorist groups in the West Bank as well but is settler violence deliberately ignored or is there just a lack of evidence ? I am aware the vast majority of Israelis are peaceful and do not support this behaviour. 

Yesh din stated that only 3% of cases regarding settler violence in the West Bank resulted in convictions. Perhaps this is due to lack of evidence, incompetence or other factors. These stats seem way off to me so I was looking to get more concise information.

‚ÄúAccording to the military‚Äôs figures, from 2017 to 2021, its law enforcement system was made aware of a total of 1,260 cases of alleged offenses by Israeli soldiers against Palestinians. A total of 248 criminal investigations were opened ‚Äì about a fifth of known cases in those years. Only 11 investigations culminated in indictments filed against soldiers for offenses against Palestinians. ‚Äú

Are there any credible sources which show how many of the setter attacks were unprovoked and how many were retaliatory or defensive in nature? I don‚Äôt find the stats compiled by the UN or activists groups to be particularly credible or compelling since they have a bias and political agenda. "

Is war with Hezbollah inevitable ? If a mere Hamas, considerably weaker, smaller than Hezbollah could launch an Oct 7 terror attack, surely Hezbollah has the ability as well. Maybe Israel will be on high alert now, would not be easily caught off guard again. More than 60,000 Israels are displaced from Israel‚Äôs norther borders due to constant rocket attacks from Hezbollah. More than 80,000 Lebanese are also displaced due to Israeli strikes and retaliations. It‚Äôs almost 12 months, how long more will this tit for tat and rocket exchange continues ? 

2. If war is inevitable, how should Israel fight this war ? 

3. Has war with Hezbollah already started ? Media dont specifically call it war though.

4. When should Israel fight this war ? I think Israel like USA is not afraid to use pre-emptive strike if they believe there will be an imminent attack.

5. Who should lead this war ? Is Nethanyahu the guy for this or wait for next election for a new leader? 

6. What preparations should Israel prepare in advance this time for an impending war ? Should it beef up its Public Relations and Communications team ? There is going to be alot of criticism from the international community, with protest rallies etc‚Ä¶ will Israel‚Äôs Public Relations team be ready ? 

7. What will Israel‚Äôs exit strategy be this time ? Remember the last war ?

1fggfkp,The anti-apartheid model and the only existential threat,2024-09-14 07:04:54,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fggfkp/the_antiapartheid_model_and_the_only_existential/,"The use of the words ‚Äúdivestment‚Äù and ‚Äúapartheid‚Äù in anti-Isreal rhetoric today means that a bit of comparison of South Africa and Israel is warranted. All sides would benefit from looking at the two cases with a certain distance to allow for comparison but with some enough particular historicity so as not to render the comparison simply rhetorical.

Demography and Geography

In Israel, a small population of Jews is surrounded by a much larger population of Arabs. The number of people who don‚Äôt neatly fit into this simple formula in the region is substantial, from Druze to noting the differences within the categories of ‚ÄúArab‚Äù and ‚ÄúJew‚Äù (Shiite versus Sunni, or religious versus secular, etc.). In South Africa, a small population of Whites was surrounded by a much larger population of Blacks. Again, the ‚ÄúColored‚Äù designation (Indian, ‚Äúmixed‚Äù or other groups) and the differences within these broad categories (by language, English versus Afrikaans, or Zulu for that matter, etc.). In both cases, events right after World War II - the institutionalization of apartheid and the first Arab-Israeli war - defined the categories and situation at least through the end of the 1980s. 

In Isreal-Palestine, some kind of partition or two-state solution was possible, given that there were clear Jewish majority areas. In South Africa, partition would be almost impossible given how the populations were dispersed. The bantustans idea - forcing Black South Africans to become citizens of territories where they may have lived - would only have had a chance of working in the face of international opposition if most White South Africans firmly backed the idea and if most White South Africans also all moved to increase some area to become White majority, and neither of these movements within the White population was ever going to happen. Also, merging the White and Colored populations into some kind of linked or allied proto-state would have helped if any kind of partition were ever to be in the cards, but hundreds of years of racism made that also impossible, despite linguistic affinity. 

So, a one-state solution was the only real solution that was ever even remotely conceivable in South Africa and a partition was only theoretically or abstractly even possible to think about and would never have happened under any realistic circumstances. White and Black categories would have to live in the same country, and there would be only one country. 

Since the end of apartheid, the fact that Nelson Mandela, despite 30-40 years of experience in 20-30 countries in Africa, did not take corruption seriously has emerged as a major blight on the legacy of the anti-apartheid movement. Mandela was in some ways the perfect leader. He was humble but strong. He was not corrupt in any way himself. He was capable of understanding his adversaries. His biggest flaw seems to be that while he was living in a prison due to racist oppression, many countries in Africa were suffering due to a lack of rule of law, which turns out to be as dangerous as racist oppression. It‚Äôs not as sexy politically, but rule of law is absolutely essential.

The foreigners in the anti-apartheid movement moved on to other issues and their lives, etc. The destiny of South Africa lay with the ANC. The foreigners and the ANC had a temporary alliance to fight racial injustice. When that was over, they went their separate ways. There is no doubt that something similar would happen in the Middle East were the foreign divestment movement or potential increasing diplomatic isolation of Israel were to get traction these movements do not have now: the actors in Palestine would not move on, and their perspective would be the only remaining point of view, when the foreigners have changed the channel to watch something else, as in South Africa. No one stuck around to make sure that a non-racial South Africa did not go down the same path as a non-racial Zimbabwe. A local peace brokered with international intervention is still a local peace. You can choose a lot in life, your job, your government, even your spouse: you cannot, however, pick your neighbors. They are the neighbors‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre stuck with your neighbors and only your neighbors. 

International Pressure and Isolation Versus War

The anti-apartheid movement of the 1980s and the growing international condemnation of apartheid was critical in convincing the majority of White South Africans to concede and give up on apartheid. The other key to this collective decision was that the ANC led by Nelson Mandela had shown enough cohesion and discipline to suggest to the White majority that Black majority rule would not lead to a massacre of Whites. 

No amount of international pressure, boycotts, divestment, or the troublesome but sustainable physical damage caused by the armed wing of the ANC would have been sufficient to end apartheid if the White majority were determined to stay in the country and if the majority of that population was also convinced that the new Black majority government might murder them. The apartheid government wasn‚Äôt broken: the White majority gave up on the apartheid project because the ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù promised by Nelson Mandela seemed better than the years of conflict holding on to the current system entailed. 

The new anti-Zionist movement for divestment holds the anti-apartheid movement up as a model. However, the differences in demography in the two regions, and the character of the armed opposition within Palestine itself mean that no amount of international pressure, divestment, etc. - were such an unlikely unified movement conceivable - would ever lead to the majority of the Jewish population to concede an end to Zionism. The majority of Jews are just as firmly convinced they would be murdered or expelled in an Arab majority single state as the majority of Whites were firmly convinced that they would not be rounded up and driven out of a Black majority South Africa. 

Divestments or boycotts of Israel might be aimed at some other goal than an end of Zionism and a single state, but an incoherent goal is tantamount to no goal, and it is hard to think that a movement with no goal is going to achieve the international acceptance as did the anti-apartheid movement. Also, Nelson Mandela and the ANC‚Äôs disciplined and clear preference for a non-racial South Africa, preferably through peaceful change if possible, wasn‚Äôt just a con job or marketing ploy, and people inside and outside of South Africa realized that the ANC was not interested in ethnic cleansing. 

Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the martyrs brigades, Hezbollah, etc. obviously and explicitly are interested in ethnic cleansing. Yassir Arafat was the last Palestinian leader with the authority and clout to sign a two-state deal, but he spoke out both sides of his mouth and clearly would have been fine with as much ethnic cleansing as he could get, which fortunately for Isreal and the Jewish people was none. 

The Jewish people, like White South Africans, would only start to consider a one-state solution if there were decades of disciplined commitment on the part of the leadership of the Arab side to a non-ethnic state, with clear leadership opposition to ethnic cleansing. Since instead of political activism a la ANC the Middle East has had 100 years of vicious ethnic war and substantial and repeated atrocities against the Jewish population, the vast majority of Jews of Isreal might need a century or two of sustained, disciplined non-violent leadership on the Arab side to think about voluntarily entering into a single state with an Arab majority. 

So, basically, forget the idea that the Jews of Isreal would ever accept a one-state solution under any conceivable or realistic scenario. The alternative to agreeing to enter into such an arrangement would be to enter into the single state by force, in other words war. If war is the only way to undo Zionism, divestment and boycotts would be allied with (groundwork for) whatever force would actually have to roll into Isreal and occupy the country, such as some kind of theoretical and currently non-existend coalition of terrorist or fundamentalist states. Such a vision of jihadis rolling into Tel Aviv is unlikely to move even the hearts of most Arabs, let alone European and American people. 

And if not jihadis on tanks rolling into Tel Aviv, what would the divestment movement hope to achieve? An agreement to join a single state is not going to happen. So then what? A two-state solution? That is conceivable without the Arab side figuring out how to win a war. A two-state solution means that the Arab and other states recognize Israel‚Äôs right to exist, which is Zionism. So, either the divestment movement wants Jihadi tanks to roll into Tel Aviv, which is not going to happen, or the divestment movement supports the goals of Zionism and is pro-Zionist. 

There is really no other end to the conflict possible. Either ethnic cleansing or a two-state deal, which brings us, inevitably, to the settlement movement in Israel. 

The Only Existential Threat to Isreal are Netanyahu‚Äôs Allies

The divestment movement with its South Africa analogy is going nowhere. The only way such a sentiment could take root and cause Israel trouble in the long term would be if the settler movement achieved the goal they have been working on for decades of making a two-state settlement impossible forever. 

After the collapse of the Camp David negotiations in the Barack-Clinton-Arafat period, the Israeli public gave up on a deal. The majority of Israelis voted for a negotiated, two-state solution twice in the late twentieth century and then turned to the right, hard. For the past 20-plus years, there has been little or no internal or external brake on the settler project. Netanyahu ran over Obama politically when he voiced even a minor quibble by interfering in internal American politics. 

Placing settlements far beyond the Green Line or near large populations of Palestinians in the West Bank, the settler movement would want their communities to be something other than potential bargaining chips that a future Ehud Barrack might offer to remove from the board. To the extent that they have or will succeed, a two-state solution becomes impossible. The only energy that can accrue to a one-state solution, with potential ethnic cleansing implications for Jews, is by making a two-state solution impossible. 

Iran has proven to be a paper tiger. Many serious people in the Arab states are clearly tired of this conflict. The peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan have held through the Gaza war and both the Egyptian and Jordanian regimes seem to be fair to good health internally. Israel faces no existential threat from the ‚Äúother‚Äù side. Hezbollah and Hamas are horrible enemies, but they do not threaten Tel Aviv in any serious way. 

Israel has not only worked to make a two-state solution impossible for twenty years, many Israelis have been wallowing in pointless and disrespectful triumphalism. Trump moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, marching through Arab neighborhoods, strutting around the grounds of a religious institution, etc: not satisfied with winning wars, some Israelis, many of whom declined to defend the state in the IDF, have been thumbing their nose and pointlessly provoking the other side in a juvenile, symbolic, and ugly way. This kind of thing only makes life harder for its allies in the Gulf, Jordan, and Egypt and is just stupid. Psychologically it might feel good, but so does taking cocaine. 

Israel, high on a strategic advantage, strayed way out ahead of its supply lines in terms of political optics. Netanyahu could yank the Americans‚Äô chain and thumb his nose at an American president. The settlers can get away with anything - no rule of law for them. Jerusalem? We can get dumb ass Trump to plant an embassy. Look at us! Fuck you!

The optics matter a lot. Even if there is no immediate prospect of a two-state solution the possibility must be preserved and this orgy of land grabbing and offensive triumphalism in the West Bank has to stop.  Otherwise, Israel really will be like South Africa, but with no Mandela in sight. 

Partition, ethnic cleansing (one way or the other), or a non-ethnic Palestine (rhetorically for some period, perhaps then reverting to ethnic cleansing), are the only ways this ends‚Ä¶ that it will never end and the ever-shifting but constant wars against changing opponents and Isreal of the last 80 years will continue forever, that seems inevitable. However, there is a logic to a demographic-political situation. There was a logic to every partition that has happened in history. There was a logic to the end of apartheid. The logic of a greater Isreal is not something Jews should embrace at all as it is too dangerous.

Think about it:

* Both sound very wonky on the face, Example:
   * So you think the Earth is flat? Yep, it's flat all the science is wrong and a massive conspiracy.
   * So you think this group named Hamas that is designated a terrorist group by every western nation is good?  Absolutely.  These countries are all wrong.  They are not terrorists.
* Both ignore mountains of evidence
   * Videos, first hand accounts, actual Hamas leaders talking about Genocide.  None of this matters.
* Love them some conspiracy theories
   * The IDF actually killed all of those people on Oct 7.  Even though thousands of survivors corroborate the mainstream narrative of a Hamas war crime.  All of the survivors are protecting Israel.  Not one of them has broken the lie on this. 
* Think they're the only ones who ""get it""
   * The world has got this all wrong.  Sometimes rape is justified.  Indiscriminate rockets being fired into your country is no reason to create a blockade.  
* Major distrust in mainstream info
   * There are no tunnels under Gaza.  
* Use logical fallacies to support their argument
   * Israel is a colonial enterprise so they don't deserve to exist, therefore Hamas is justified to rape and murder in order to get their land back and be free.
* Fall for internet meme propaganda very easily
   * I had a Hamas supporter send me a tik-tok video of some South African teenager talking about how bad the IDF practices were.  This was like an actual source for him.  When I said none of the facts he mentioned could be referenced, the guy goes yeah well IDF actually does all that so it doesn't matter.  Just like a flat earther would do.

Not saying all liberals are like this, but the ones defending Hamas? Kinda giving flat earth vibes.

Both groups seem to live in their own little world where facts don't matter and everything's the evil ""man"" trying to hold them down. Wouldn't be surprised if there were flat earthers out there that even blame the round earth theory on the Jews.

Denying Jewish indigeneity to Israel despite mountains of DNA evidence: Flat earth  
Calling Israel an Apartheid state despite Arabs voting and holding office: Flat earth  
Believing that Hamas is somehow fighting to improve the lives of Palestinians: Flat Earth  
Hamas didn't rape any women on Oct 7: Flat earth  
Hamas doesn't use human shields: Flat earth"

While the persecution of Jews is widely recognized, it‚Äôs crucial to note that much of this persecution came from European powers rather than from the Arab world.

For centuries, Jewish communities lived in relative peace in many Arab and Muslim lands. Under Islamic rule, particularly during the **Ottoman Empire** (1517-1917), Jews were considered *dhimmis*‚Äîa protected minority. While there were certain limitations, such as paying the *jizya* tax, Jews were allowed to practice their faith freely, own property, and were integral parts of trade, culture, and society. In fact, the **Ottomans welcomed Jewish refugees** fleeing persecution in Europe, particularly after the expulsion from Spain in 1492.

By contrast, the persecution of Jews was primarily a European phenomenon. From the **Inquisition in Spain** to the **pogroms in Eastern Europe** and eventually the horrors of the **Holocaust**, Jewish communities were often marginalized, scapegoated, and violently targeted across Europe. Jews in Arab lands didn‚Äôt face this same systemic violence and discrimination. 

It was only with the rise of **political Zionism** and the subsequent push for a Jewish state in Palestine that tensions between Jews and Arabs began to rise in the Middle East. Before this, Jews and Muslims in places like Morocco, Iraq, and Egypt lived together peacefully for centuries.

This historical context is vital in understanding how European colonialism and nationalism influenced Jewish history and relations with their Arab neighbors. The narrative of Jewish-Arab conflict is largely a modern one, tied to 20th-century political developments rather than ancient religious or ethnic hostilities.

However, DNA testing is still permitted in certain circumstances, such as for medical research, criminal investigations, and specific court cases.

Especially in spaces like this, where facts are continuously distorted to justify acts that, in any other context, would be universally condemned.

Instead of acknowledging the reality, they scramble to find technical loopholes as to why it‚Äôs not really a genocide, or worse, why it‚Äôs somehow justified. This often comes hand in hand with a deliberate attempt to obscure the truth about Israel being an apartheid state, built on systemic racism and ethnic cleansing. They try to shift the blame to Hamas, as though the suffering and dispossession of Palestinians didn't begin decades before Hamas even existed. Israel has bombed refugee camps, flattened entire neighborhoods, and targeted medical facilities and schools, all under the guise of ‚Äòdefense.‚Äô Yet, the question remains: who is defending the Palestinian civilians?

The atrocities don‚Äôt end at bombings. Israel's military has committed countless war crimes, including the cold-blooded murder of children, the rape of civilians, and the relentless collective punishment of a people who are effectively trapped under occupation. In the West Bank, where Hamas has no presence, Israel still executes its brutal agenda‚Äîsettlers, with full backing from the state, continue their violent encroachment, and any resistance is met with disproportionate military force. The cycle of violence is never-ending, as though the erasure of Palestinian identity is the ultimate goal.

Yet, we‚Äôre supposed to buy into the narrative that Hamas is the root of all evil? That somehow, the relentless oppression, bombing of refugee camps, and the stripping away of human dignity is acceptable? This is the same twisted logic that allows these actions to be glossed over, reframing the oppressor as the victim and ignoring the fact that Palestinians are forced to endure a life where basic human rights are denied at every turn.

What‚Äôs most disturbing is how the people defending Israel's war crimes need to reflect on the monsters they‚Äôve become‚Äîjustifying the very actions that they themselves would have condemned in movies like Star Wars, where the empire indiscriminately oppresses entire populations. But this isn‚Äôt fiction. It‚Äôs real, it‚Äôs ongoing, and no amount of intellectual gymnastics will change the fact that Israel is committing war crimes and has been for decades."

The Navajo are massacred and and expelled throughout the Americas.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, further massacres occur, and half of Navajos die in a massive genocide. Many of the survivors flee back to what used to be Navajo lands, the only place they have ever lived in safety and with dignity, where they join their Navajo brothers who never left, but have been living in their homeland as second-class citizens under American rule, subject to massacres.

Through unrelated causes, the United States crumbles, and the US government goes ahead and divides up its land into small nation-state countries for various groups living in their empire, such as the Texans and the Amish. The Navajos living in historic Navajo lands request a country ‚Äî both because they are a group living there (like all the other groups who get country) and because they clearly need a country to have safety and dignity for the first time in centuries (in particular, for the millions of Navajo being massacred in other places at this moment).

Meanwhile, they give white groups 49 countries, all which have Navajo minorities.¬†Minorities in all of these places can choose to either live as minorities or move to countries where they are majorities.

To Israelis and Israel‚Äôs allies, the existence of the extremist movement is key. 

Why? 

Because this threat is international in scope. Most western countries have been affected by Islamic extremists. The U.S. has seen its fair share of attacks, with 9/11 being the deadliest. There were hundreds of plots. America‚Äôs intelligence agencies foiled most plots, but it‚Äôs enough for agencies like FBI to get it wrong once for something truly terrible to happen. 

Most recently, the FBI foiled a major plot to attack American Jews in Brooklyn, NY. 

https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/pakistani-national-charged-plotting-terrorist-attack-new-york-city-support-isis

Earlier this year, another Islamic extremist was arrested for plotting to assassinate former President Donald Trump 

https://apnews.com/article/iran-pakistan-murderforhire-trump-justice-department-5a3abe0895ae7c2be14f89fc4e49bc53


The plotter is allegedly tied to the radical, Islamist regime in Iran. 

The threat on European Jews and Europeans in general is particularly grave. 

The number of attacks carried out or foiled is astounding. 

The Islamist terrorist threat in Europe is tied to the largest political controversy in modern European politics. 

The rise of the populist right there is almost entirely a reaction by everyday European voters who became tired of Islamist extremism. The situation in Europe is exacerbated by the fact that European states have seen a huge increase in the number of immigrants coming from Muslim majority countries. 

These immigrants, as many other immigrant communities do, establish strong and often exclusive communities in ethnic enclaves throughout Europe. 

Many immigrants refuse to assimilate, and import extremist attitudes from their homelands. Hamas, Iran, ISIS, Al Qaida, Muslim Brotherhood, Hezbollah and other extremist entities have all established strong networks in Europe. 

These networks raise funds, engage in proselytizing, promote jihad, engage in legal political activism, engage in criminal activity, and engage in politically motivated violence, including targeted assassinations and mass killings. 

The anti Israel campaign views them as freedom fighters. Yes, Al Qaida too. 

https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/11/16/tech/tiktok-osama-bin-laden-letter-to-america

Isn‚Äôt it a bit strange?

You bet it is. 

We often hear leftists say they condemn Hamas, and condemn extremism. 

But if they do, why do they collaborate with the Muslim brotherhood? 

Why do they parrot jihadi talking points? 


I just want to raise awareness on this topic on this subreddit.

Did it just never happen at all? Did some other event preclude it? Does anyone know?"
1fft1e7,South African perspective: Is Israel an apartheid state?,2024-09-13 12:04:47,87,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fft1e7/south_african_perspective_is_israel_an_apartheid/,"Israel: Is it an Apartheid State? What follows is my personal opinion. The question, what is your opinion, and what is it based on? Also, once you have read my opinion, and watched the video, what do you think now?

I've been fairly outspoken about the fact that I disagree with the comparison to apartheid that Israel is accused of. I was at first absolutely confounded that anyone would agree with such an assessment, let alone the ANC. But, I had to keep the history in mind. I know the history. In truth, I found the assessment that another country was suffering what we did outrageous. I found it upsetting and insulting. Did this horrific time period teach humanity nothing? South Africans managed to reconcile, find peace and work together (sorta/kinda/maybe/for the most part hehe) Can't they?!

Reconciliation is a big part of our shared identity and culture. This is honestly what makes South Africans such a friendly people - I genuinely believe that.

As a South African, I grew up in apartheid transitioning to democracy, and as a citizen of Earth, I've watched endless conflicts around the globe. I know what humans are capable of when at their worst. I have lived through humanity displaying their best.

I'm incredibly proud of the peaceful transition we accomplished, and how we genuinely lived up to the reconciliation dream. I'm so proud of what we've accomplished especially when I look at the rest of the world, and Israel/Palestine in particular.

That doesn't mean I'm blind to the faults here though (or there). Or don't have political opinions (I am generally not interested - just informed. I vote for the best option logically (not party affiliated).

I specify this so you understand that I am just genuinely proud of what we've overcome, and how deeply ingrained the concept of reconciliation is in my entire identity.

The comparison to a geopolitical issue in the Middle East is deeply upsetting and insulting. And deeply inaccurate. It is not even remotely the same.

I believe Gayton McKenzie covers it in this:(approx 11 minutes in)

[https://youtu.be/daiXKgzUU8U?si=pIhdSs5aeVYkgiOT](https://youtu.be/daiXKgzUU8U?si=pIhdSs5aeVYkgiOT)

It's not the same. If you guys think this is even on the same page, you know nothing of apartheid. I lived through the death clutches of it. Guys you don't know. No one gets to diminish the suffering, hurt, anger, humiliation, reconciliation, compassion and peace that we overcame/achieved by cheapening it this way.

Don't appropriate my culture/history/pain/suffering to legitimise antisemitism or hate of any kind. (But Jews in particular were allies so it does not even make sense). DO appropriate my culture to learn about reconciliation and moving forward in a better way though!

  
Edit: Thank you to everyone that replied in good faith to the actual questions I asked.

  
I am not going to continue replying. I may reply here and there, but definitely not engaging with the aggressive nonsense anymore. Most of those didn't answer my questions  and basically interrogated me about Israeli laws like I made it happen. I shared my perspective in this post, and shared a politicians view, then asked the sub what they believed, and whether what I shared made a difference to them. 

The aggression is a tad... well I'm kind of speechless. shouldn't be though, not after the nonsense I've been seeing over the past year"
1ffocpw,The right approach to creating one state,2024-09-13 06:45:25,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ffocpw/the_right_approach_to_creating_one_state/,"I believe in one state, but there are some complicated problems to sort out. How can we avoid massacres, civil war, and discrimination? What happens if one group is a minority, and the majority elects psychos like Hamas or the Likud? This led me to the conclusion that one state can only happen once tensions are very low. A ceasefire must occur, Hamas needs to be ousted, and elections should happen in Palestine only after Gaza has healed to avoid electing radicals. The details of getting rid of Hamas are challenging, but it is better for a US backed moderate government to fight a civil war against Hamas than for Israel to bomb all of Gaza and hope they kill a few fighters. As for ousting Israel's leaders, the Israelis will elect moderates once there is a clear path to peace. Educating a new generation is the next step. Education in both Israel and Palestine must humanize the other side. Palestinian students should learn Hebrew, and Israelis should learn Arabic. Israeli society has to become less militarized. The IDF is great at turning young, guillable Israelis into genocidal lunatics. Once both peoples are sane and reasonable, the states should be merged into one secular state of Palestine, to be shared by Jews, Muslims and Christians. If you have any thoughts, please let me know."
1ffjydd,Pro-Palestinians -- would you personally accept a partition that would see Israel solely annex East Jerusalem and not any settlement blocs in the WB?,2024-09-13 02:21:07,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ffjydd/propalestinians_would_you_personally_accept_a/,"To specify, Israel currently claims East Jerusalem as legally Israeli territory. This territory lays behind the Green Line, which is the UN-recognized border of Palestine -- the PA recognizes all of Jerusalem as Palestinian sovereignty, (which the UN does not agree with -- they only see East Jerusalem as Palestinian sovereignty, not West Jerusalem.) but in this theoretical agreement, Israel agrees to disband all settlements, military areas & outposts in the West Bank in return for the annexation of all of Jerusalem, including East Jerusalem.

This annexation would be along Israel's current interpretation of the borders of municipal Jerusalem i.e including areas like Sheikh Jarrah and the Jerusalem Airport.

All other UN-recognized Palestinian territory such as the seam zone, Gaza and the remainder of the West Bank would be under the full sovereignty of an independent Palestinian state. No Israeli military or civil security forces would remain in this independent Palestinian territory. The Temple Mount would be entirely within the sovereignty of Israel. The question of refugees would be decisively concluded and Israel would not provide any significant land redistribution to the 1948 refugees. The area of the Golan Heights would probably remain Israeli sovereignty, although I'd imagine this wouldn't be final and there's room for a more liberal government to concede the area. (This isn't terribly relevant to the question of Palestinian sovereignty to begin with.)

From an Israeli perspective (I am an Israeli myself) this is an extremely generous concession, as not only is there a massive civilian presence in the West Bank which has existed continuously for 60-70 years, there are many sites extremely important to Judaism in the West Bank that the seizure of would, in my view, be conducive to a far-right uprising in Israel. As is well-known, the concession of these settlements would also mean, in terms of access to Israel, a return to the days of the Fedayeen -- infiltrations would be much easier and theoretically missile attacks could leave people living in currently missile-protected and safe cities like Tel-Aviv extremely vulnerable.

I won't try to speak for the pro-Palestinian or Palestinian perspective, I hope to leave that to the discussion."
1ffdckb,Change your way of thinking: A call for peace üáµüá∏üáÆüá±,2024-09-12 21:01:59,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ffdckb/change_your_way_of_thinking_a_call_for_peace/,"If we put aside the violence‚Äî Palestinians killed, terror attacks against Israelis, personal losses, the devastation in Gaza, and the occupation of the West Bank-the core truth remains: this conflict will only end when both sides realize that violence will never achieve the results they want.
Israelis will not experience true peace and calm if they continue to ignore the underlying issues and maintain the occupation, because events like October 7 will repeat. Similarly,
Palestinians will not achieve statehood if they do not accept that Israel is here to stay, and that negotiation, not resistance, is the only realistic path forward.

Consider this: the only time Palestinians regained any land, however minimal, was through the Oslo Accords. Despite the flaws of that peace deal, it showed that peace talks brought more benefits
-economic growth, international recognition, aid, healthcare, and improved living standards-than resistance ever could. For Israelis, it was one of the calmest periods in recent memory. I remember a CBS documentary featuring Moshe, an Israeli, and Munir, a Palestinian. They visited each other freely-Moshe would go to Nablus, sit in caf√©s, while Munir worked in Moshes company in Tel Aviv and stayed with his family and took care of his children. They were more than friends they were family, https://youtu.be/s2FBJ9riqvo?feature=shared It felt as if they were on vacation in each other's country. This is the reality we all seek. Seriously if you are still reading this post (and if you still are thank you üôè) go check out that video it will give you a sense of what peace truly is


To achieve that, we must start with a shift in mindset. Replace hatred and anger with a commitment to peace.
While it's easier to let anger guide us, love and understanding are the true paths to progress. Both Palestinians and Israelis have the power to pressure their leaders to prioritize peace. If large crowds can gather to support either Israel or Palestine, surely they can unite around peace, pushing leaders to finally act."
1ffcoef,A modest proposal to deal with recurring Beita protests.,2024-09-12 20:33:52,0,https://i.redd.it/rp73wph9vfod1.jpeg,"Attention: Armchair Generals.

 The article in the Washington Post about the shooting of Aysenur Eygi were some details that suggested these Friday prayer protests descending into violence is a weekly thing, that‚Äôs it‚Äôs organized by the International Solidarity Committee, a terrorist adjacent operation, that the victims first get a week long training in protest tactics, that the victim felt nervous and concerned for her safety and that her showing ‚Äúsupport‚Äù or whatever had put her unexpectedly in a dangerous place.

Now in several recent comments here we‚Äôve discussed that tourists, as ‚Äúnon immigrant‚Äù visa holders and guests of a country, do not necessarily have the rights of legal citizens and there are things they can‚Äôt do, like work, for instance.  They also can‚Äôt participate in political protests, particular those which the visited country believes are illegal gatherings.

Without Aysenur Eygi being killed there‚Äôs no story, at least in the Washington Post, AP, and all .  If the bullet had hit one of the local rock throwers instead, probably no story except maybe Ha‚Äôaretz and 972 Magazine.  Bunch of Pallywood TikToks, but that‚Äôs just noise. Seen the movie before.

This is basically a remake of the ‚ÄúGreat March of Return‚Äù, staged protest with deliberately putting citizens in harms way in a military area as a lethal but ‚Äúviral‚Äù publicity stunt.

Might it not therefore be a better strategy here try to nip the Friday Prayer/Protest thing in the bud, at least from the perspective of removing foreign national sympathizers from the scene, by putting several checkpoints on Route 60 or 505 of a nearby towns like at Huwwara and Zeitara where the only reason you‚Äôd be on that road was to get to the Beita turnoff.

Then all the troops have to do is look at the ID card or Passport and ask foreign nationals why they are going to Beita.  Then arrest and deport them.  Handcuffs for three hours vs. possible coffins.  Doing them and everyone else a big favor.

I‚Äôm not sure how this would interface with the normal checkpoints and policing/military in this part of the West Bank, where areas A B and C and those roads fit into this so it might not work because of that.  I‚Äôm also assuming that the ISC volunteers are coached to say they‚Äôre just being tourists or visiting family and lying at normal WB checkpoints as well that could lead to many destinations, which is why I‚Äôm suggesting a practical way is actually catching them in the act of violating their visas by being in a place that there‚Äôs no possible explanation for why they would be there other than the protests, then promptly deporting them."

No, not just the ""children"" (teenagers old enough to commit offenses) or administrative detainees (who aren't even a majority of Palestinian prisoners anyway), those are just excuses. They seem offended by the idea of Israel imprisoning any Palestinian whatsoever, even those who murdered Israeli civilians.

The thing is, obviously Israel takes objection to its people being murdered. The goal is apparently to make murdering Israelis devoid of as many consequences as possible. The whole point of courts and prisons is to punish and deter. Of course the same people demanding Israel release prisoners in exchange for a deal would no doubt shriek to high heaven if Israel began implementing the death penalty.

So here's my suggestion. If Palestinians want to send the message that Israelis are fair game and no sentence for killing Israelis will be fully served, we will do likewise. Any prisoner exchange deal should also have a set number of settler criminals imprisoned for crimes against Palestinians released. In the future if the Palestinians demand the release of October 7th perpetrators, we'll propose releasing Amiram Ben-Uliel, the guy who burned the Dawabshe family alive, with them. Note that I really dislike the settler movement and I especially dislike the violent settler thugs intensely, but this may be an effective way to send a message. What say you all?"

1fem1bu,How do I talk about I/P with a friend when we don't always agree?,2024-09-11 21:43:31,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fem1bu/how_do_i_talk_about_ip_with_a_friend_when_we_dont/,"My friend and I agree on the majority of our politics except for I/P. My best friend is anti Hamas and supports a 2ss but considers himself a pro Palestine anti zionist. I consider myself anti Hamas, anti current israeli gov, anti Hamas and a non zionist (my relationship with zionism is complicated)

For context I'm jewish and my friend is not and I grew up in a super zionist household that's pretty hawkish on Israel. Basically the Biden administration is too pro palestine, most palestinians are not innocent people, the media is so biased against Israel. Basically a fan of Caroline Glick and others. My views have balanced and mellowed out over the years and I listen to people like LonerBox for I/P and listen to both pro Israel and pro Palestine commentators to get both sides.

We had a different perspective today on radicalization of Palestinians and Israelis. My best friend was arguing that if Palestinians were free, Palestinians would be less radical and I pointed to a Corey Gil Shuster interview recently where Palestinians said FTRTTS when Palestine becomes free it would be free of Jews. I pointed out that this is radical to me, you think they would be less radical. My friend was like, ""well these are radical opinions, but they've been oppressed that makes sense they would hold those views and I don't blame them at all"" Or he made a comment about how Palestinians don't have the power to do that even if they wanted to. Or in the past comments like well Israel's actions make it easier for Hamas to educate and radicalize people into hating the people.

When I talk about what causes Israeli radicalization he's like I mean sure they can be radicalized but I don't see how they can be this radicalized they weren't occupied, kept in a open air prison, Israelis aren't oppressed at all. If Israel didn't exist none of this would be happening.

On a separate topic he like zionism is bad. Zionism is inheritantly anti Palestinian, and it's nationalistic, or it's wanting a jewish ethnostate, while putting Jewish needs above others in the land then I don't like that. I tried explaining that there are zionist who use to mean jewish self determination and he said, ""what does that mean then that's so broad"" and he said if it just means for Israelis to live in Israel that's fine but then I would be a zionist and I believe that someone who just uses it that way isn't a zionist and if they insist on calling themselves that I would wonder why they're so attached to that word or Israel. He said equating anti zionism with wanting Israel destroyed is the same as someone assuming if you are anti Hamas you want dead Palestinians. He also said he doesn't believe liberal zionists exist or moderate zionism if there is it's a tiny minority or vert rare in the way he'll accept it. Anti zionism doesn't have to necessarily be anti semitic and if they are then they're not anti zionist they're just anti semitic and use it as an excuse to hate Jews, and he said some people can use zionism as a dog whistle to mean Jews.

Another topic we also disagree on is being tribalistic. I try to care about Palestinians and Israelis equally he'll complain that I'm too tribalistic with my jewish side at times. I'm mixed half asian and half jewish and my jewish side has been experiencing anti semitism online and other things and my best friend thinks my tribalism when it does come up can lead to me not caring about other groups and that's an issue. He's aware as a straight white man he's privileged and isn't part of a marginalized group but he likes to think that if he was apart of one he would care about everyone equally.

I notice there's a disconnect when we have these conversations and if we are not agreeing or on the same page he'll say things like I don't want to continue, I'm done, or I'm not changing my mind on this. I'll point out that he's not willing to have his mind changed and he'll say something like some other day sure, but not right now.

How do I have these conversations with my best friend, and if you are a similar situation with anybody in our life how do you navigate them?"

>Aysenur was peacefully protesting in the West Bank‚Äîstanding up against the expansion of settlements‚Äîwhen her young life was senselessly cut short. No one should be killed for participating in a **peaceful protest**.

Those of us who closely follow the conflict know that Palestinian protests are anything but peaceful and this case was no different. According to one of the participants, Palestinians were throwing stones at the troops prior to the incident which resulted in Aysenur Eygi's death. Additionally, in a statement by the IDF, shots were fired at a main instigator who was hurling stones at forces and had posed a threat.

This tone deaf statement shows Kamala's lack of understanding when it comes to the actions of Palestinians in the West Bank and her whitewashing of Palestinian violence against Israelis. The false implication that Israel is executing people participating in peaceful protest is disgusting and similar accusations will likely become a regular occurrence in her administration if she were to be elected."

My name is Arnon Degani (PhD), I'm a historian of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and together with graphics and video wiz Ron Eden, we have launched a new web-series on the Israeli Palestinian Conflict. It's based on the courses I've taught and research I conducted in the last couple of years.  

The channel represents an attempt to talk differently on this topic: more dispassionately, but with a lot of empathy (keeping in mind the horrible violence happening right now). The Israeli-Palestinian conflict conjures emotions and feelings of righteousness that at times seem to surpass those experienced by actual Israelis and Palestinians. Any significant commentary on the conflict, whether academic, journalistic, and artistic, is often a topic of heated controversy and tends to be simplistically labeled as either ‚Äúpro-Palestinian‚Äù or ‚Äúpro-Israeli.‚Äù We think that it is possible to have strong partisan views over this conflict, and yet to transcend this dichotomy when discussing history. At least we can try.

Our channel delves into the pivotal events, influential figures, and the complex dynamics that have shaped this longstanding conflict. Whether you're a student, history enthusiast, or curious about the intricacies of the region; Whether you support Israel, Palestine, neither or both we offer in-depth, well-researched content to deepen the understanding of one of the world's most significant and polarizing conflicts. 

The first episode delves into the question of objectively and bias in talking about this conflict. The second episode is an attempt to find the conflict's algorithm: the rules that determine its historical development. The third will delve into the primordial soup of Zionism. Chapter 4 is about the origins of Palestiniam nationalism. Chapter 5 will survey the British mandate period. We hope to upload a new chapter every week.

Who is considered better to the short term and long term wellbeing of Palestinian people in Gaza?

Who do you reckon would have the best success in ending the war? Why do you think this person would excel here better?

Perhaps more importantly, who poses a greater risk to the welfare of the citizens of Gaza over the next 4 years?

Is it possible that Trump could be argued to be a bigger risk solely due to the fact that under Biden, the death toll has, at least alleged by the Gaza Ministry of Health, slowed in its rate of deaths per day. Could a Trump election make this war more violent as Trump provides Israel what it needs ‚Äúto finish the war‚Äù? 

In my view, this phrase ‚Äúto finish the war‚Äù, as Trump says he wants to see Israel do, could ostensibly lead to greater pressure on the Israelis to target the Hamas militants, leading to deaths like we saw in the first months of this war where deaths were as high as in the four figures as opposed to reportedly far lower now.


  

On a less relevant note, who do you think Netanyahu would rather see elected? Who do you think the leadership in Hamas would prefer? Could different terrorists in Hamas and different politicians in Netanyahu‚Äôs war cabinet have different preferences?



Statistics as relates to the conflict and death toll:
(Stats provided from OpenAI)

Polling on Public Views in Israel:
Polling conducted in Israel during times of conflict often shows strong public support for aggressive military action against Hamas, especially during periods of rocket attacks or escalations. For example, during the 2021 conflict between Israel and Gaza, polls conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute indicated that nearly 70% of Jewish Israelissupported continuing military operations against Hamas until a ceasefire was achieved on Israel‚Äôs terms. Public opinion can be a significant factor in guiding the actions of Israeli leadership, particularly Prime Minister Netanyahu, who often emphasizes national security and the elimination of Hamas in his public rhetoric.
As of late 2023, with the war still ongoing, similar polling suggests that the Israeli population remains largely in favor of decisive military action, with more than 60% of respondents in a recent survey supporting Netanyahu‚Äôs government continuing operations against Hamas until the group is neutralized. This sentiment aligns with Trump‚Äôs rhetoric of allowing Israel to ‚Äúfinish the war‚Äù without interference, which could signal a continued or intensified military campaign if he were re-elected.

Polling on Views in Gaza and Palestine:
On the Palestinian side, the population of Gaza has experienced significant losses in both civilian and combatant casualties, which has deeply affected public opinion regarding the conflict. In Gaza, where Hamas maintains control, polling is more difficult to conduct, but available data indicates that Palestinians are deeply disillusioned with both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority (PA). A Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) poll from late 2023 found that 73% of Palestinians expressed dissatisfaction with the PA‚Äôs leadership, while 60% in Gaza said they feared speaking out against Hamas.
Interestingly, despite this dissatisfaction, Hamas still garners a certain level of support among Palestinians as a resistance movement, particularly when Israeli military actions intensify. A 2023 poll from the West Bank showed that 58% of Palestinians supported armed struggle as the preferred method to achieve independence. This illustrates the complex relationship between the population's suffering and their attitudes toward Hamas. While they may be critical of the group‚Äôs governance, many see its armed resistance as a necessary counter to Israeli military actions.

U.S. Public Opinion:
Polling in the United States reflects a polarized view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A Gallup poll from early 2024 revealed that while Republicans overwhelmingly support Israel, with 85% approval, Democrats have become more divided on the issue. About 44% of Democrats now express more sympathy toward Palestinians, a significant shift compared to past decades when support for Israel was more bipartisan. This growing divide in U.S. public opinion reflects broader ideological shifts, with progressive Democrats increasingly critical of Israel‚Äôs actions in Gaza and calling for a more balanced U.S. foreign policy approach.

Death Toll and Rate of Change:
The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has seen a staggering death toll, with both combatants and civilians caught in the crossfire. According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, as of late 2023, the death toll has reached over 12,000, with more than 5,000 of those deaths being civilians, including many women and children. The rate of casualties has varied throughout the conflict. During the initial weeks of fighting, daily death tolls reached as high as 500‚Äì600 per day, largely due to airstrikes targeting Hamas infrastructure embedded in civilian areas.
However, after international pressure and diplomatic efforts, including from the Biden administration, the rate of deaths reportedly slowed. By mid-2024, daily casualties had decreased to less than 100 deaths per day, though sporadic escalations caused spikes. It‚Äôs important to note that these numbers are based on reports from the Gaza Ministry of Health, which operates under Hamas, and therefore some critics have questioned the accuracy of the data. Nonetheless, the reported figures are a stark indicator of the scale of the human tragedy unfolding in the region.

Comparisons of Trump and Biden Administrations:
A critical aspect of assessing the impact of future U.S. leadership on the war involves comparing the approaches of the Trump and Biden administrations. Under Biden, there has been a concerted effort to push for de-escalation and humanitarian aid to Gaza, although his administration continues to support Israel's right to defend itself. The Biden administration‚Äôs diplomatic pressure is believed to have contributed to the slowing rate of civilian casualties, as Israeli military actions have reportedly become more targeted in an effort to avoid international backlash.
Conversely, under Trump, Israeli military actions were often given full backing with fewer public calls for restraint. This policy gave Israel broad latitude in its military operations, which some argue led to higher casualties during past conflicts. If Trump were re-elected and returned to a policy of providing Israel with full military and diplomatic support to ""finish the war,"" it‚Äôs possible the conflict could intensify, leading to a resumption of higher civilian casualty rates similar to those seen in the early phases of the 2023 war.
Impact of Public Sentiment on the Conflict:
Public opinion in Israel, Gaza, Palestine, and the United States plays a significant role in shaping the actions of political leaders. In Israel, where support for military action remains high, Netanyahu's government is likely to continue its military campaign against Hamas as long as public opinion supports it. In Gaza and the West Bank, while there is dissatisfaction with the leadership of Hamas and the PA, the population remains trapped in a cycle of violence where both support for armed resistance and the desire for international intervention coexist.
In the U.S., the growing divide between Republican and Democratic views on the conflict could impact future U.S. foreign policy. A Trump presidency would likely see a return to more uncritical support for Israel, while a continuation of the Biden administration could maintain the current balance of military support for Israel with efforts to mitigate civilian casualties through diplomatic channels.

Conclusion
The humanitarian toll in Gaza has reached alarming levels, and polling data from the regions involved shows deep divisions in how the conflict is perceived. Israelis largely support a hardline approach, while Palestinians remain divided between disillusionment with their leadership and support for armed resistance against Israeli military actions. In the United States, public opinion is increasingly polarized, with Republicans supporting Israel's military operations and a growing number of Democrats advocating for Palestinian rights and a peaceful resolution.
If Trump were to return to office, his more aggressive stance could lead to an intensification of the conflict, resulting in higher civilian casualties in Gaza. On the other hand, the Biden administration's more cautious approach has contributed to a slowing rate of civilian deaths, though it remains unclear if this trend can be sustained. Ultimately, the welfare of Gaza‚Äôs citizens will depend on the decisions of both local leaders and international actors, with U.S. leadership playing a key role in determining the future course of the conflict.

Although the word 'fake' was used the article itself basically said that the document exists.

So two sources now ([Source01](https://www.israelhayom.co.il/news/geopolitics/article/16420643); [Source02](https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/ryxa11sa2r#autoplay)) claim to have seen the full document and the document is as follows:

The document is a sort of recommendation document to higher ups (Sinwar) and the influence of the deal on the organization and Israel, citizens & kidnapped families.

The document was written on 11/April/2024 and refers to the proposal from 8/April/2024. The document was translated from Arabic to Hebrew to English here:

>""We received the mediators' latest proposal dated April 8, consisting of three pages under the heading 'Key principles for the agreement between the Israeli side and the Palestinian side in Gaza on the exchange of hostages and prisoners and the return to sustainable peace.'

>It seems that there are several factors that should be examined when making a decision and its negative and positive effects,""

>""These are the factors:  
\* The degree of firm standing ('Hasumud') of the internal front  
\* The degree of the ability of our forces to adhere and act  
\* The level of adhesion and exhaustion in the enemy's internal front, both political & militarily  
\* The level of international pressure and the legitimacy of the war; The role of the other fronts (Hezbollah, Iran, the Houthis)"".

>""In general, flexibility should be expressed so that Hamas does not bear responsibility for the failure to reach an agreement. We estimate that it will be possible to improve some of the essential conditions in the agreement, even if the negotiations continue for a longer period of time, and when we benefit from the factors of pressure on the enemy.""

>""To agree to the proposal with a few comments, so that it will not be easy to regard Hamas as the party that thwarts the agreement.

>These comments include Hamas' conditions:  
\* Hamas's right to name 100 life prisoners  
\* The return of the displaced (to the north of the Gaza Strip - SHK)  
\* The opening of the Rashid streets and Salah al-Din (the central roads in the Gaza Strip) with the delivery of the first pulse of the Israeli prisoners, provided that it is on the first or second day of the agreement.  
\* The deletion of the phrase 'gradual return', and the deletion of the phrase 'unarmed'""

>""As a political maneuver and throwing the ball into the court of the enemy and the mediators - to propose the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip at the end of the first phase - in exchange for agreeing to the deployment of Arab forces on the eastern and northern borders, provided that they are deployed at the end of the first phase, so that the Arab force will be a barrier that will prevent the enemy from raiding the Gaza Strip after The end of the war, until the reorganization of the ranks and military capabilities of Hamas.""

>""Not to agree to a number of 500 trucks, but to consider this as the minimum requirement of aid, so that it does not include the trucks of the private sector, or to add the phrase 'in a way that satisfies the essential requirements of the residents of the Gaza Strip'.""

>""The phrasing to the media should bring to light the stubbornness of the enemy. That is, that the enemy insists and rejects the American proposal that Hamas received in mid-March. There is a need for consultation with Hezbollah, the Revolutionary Guards and Ansarallah (the Houthis) regarding the ceasefire negotiations (in a situation where Hamas will decide on a hudna of only six weeks or the negotiations on the second phase will fail). The continuation of the psychological pressure on the prisoners' families at the moment, and during the first phase (of the deal), so that popular pressure on the enemy government will increase.""

1fe1p1e,Everyone is talking about Palestinians this election cycle.

Now I would strongly disagree with this line-- ""I know my Jewish and Israeli American allies and friends are also suffering from a similar dynamic within their communities. Their identities, too, have been hijacked by extremist voices claiming to speak for them as a monolithic group."" As we know, the overwhelming majority of American Jews are Zionist, regardless of whether we support Netanyahu or not. And while there is a very well known diversity of voices within the Jewish community, there's **not ONE** ""pro-Palestinian"" group which accepts the concept of two states for two peoples (there used to be one, the American Task Force for Palestine, but it's been defunct for a decade).¬† If that last statement is incorrect, please feel free to name a self-described pro-Palestinian group that does accept peace on the basis of two states for two peoples. I'm genuinely not aware of one. 

Nonetheless, he's a reasonable person whose voice is certainly drowned out by the ""river to the sea"" extremists. We also have to be careful of tokenizing outliers in their community, and in the absence of polling data and of other voices who say the same. I wouldn't want to say that he represents anyone except himself.  

Is there anyone from the Palestinian-American (or Palestinian-Canadian, Palestinian-European, etc) community here who agrees with Ahmed? Do you feel that you are able to speak up in the way that he does? Do internal conversations within your community include perspectives beyond ""river to the sea"" anti-Zionism?  "
1fe0q78,Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump just finished their debate,2024-09-11 03:29:24,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fe0q78/vice_president_kamala_harris_and_president_donald/,"Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump just finished their debate.

They have both expressed their own stance as being supportive of Israel.

Trump has a history of being one of the most actively pro-zionist presidents. His administrations policy directly effected the situation in the Middle East, especially in light of the ""Abraham Accords"" between Israel and other nations.

Harris has a history of being strongly aligned with pro-palestinian politicians and has very much been a do-nothing vice-president. Trump claims she hates Israel and that her election as president would lead to Israel's destruction. However, during this short campaign of hers and in the debate tonight she has flipped to a passionately pro-Israel stance. She even pushed hard on the ~~questionable~~ rape accusation on Oct 7. (edit: UN reported that there are ‚Äúreasonable grounds‚Äù this happened) 

My question is how does tonight's presidential debate change or reinforce you perception of either candidates Israel policy? Regardless of who you would vote for as the leader of the USA, which candidate aligns most with what you believe should be done in the Israel/Palestine conflict?

If you wish for Israel's downfall, which candidate would help reach that goal? If you wish for Israel to dominate the region, who could help that happen? If you yearn for a two-state solution, which US president is better equipped to make that happen?

Do you believe either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris are being honest about what they will do? Do you think that it even matters who might win the US election this November?"

1fdl5lp,For Hamas a killed Israeli hostage is now much more valuable than a living one.,2024-09-10 15:48:59,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fdl5lp/for_hamas_a_killed_israeli_hostage_is_now_much/,"Although it is no Israeli protester's true intention, the public reaction to Bibi's refusal of the hostage deal makes a killed hostage more valuable for Hamas than a living hostage in the long term.   
 Hamas is aware of the ongoing Israeli public outcry and protest movements, Yahya Sinwar is knowledgeable of Israel's social fabric and the inner conflict that Israeli is in the midst of.   
This when combined with the widespread destruction of Gaza and Hamas makes it more useful for Hamas to let hostages die, preferably due to Israeli gunfire or in proximity to a rescue attempt.

A dead hostage, either killed near rescue or due to Israeli fire, strikes and hurts the Israeli public, turning Israelis less supportive of continued warfare and more antagonist towards each other.   
On the other hand a living hostage, gives Israel's government and army legitimacy at home and pushes the Israelis to continue struggling. 

Therefore current best course for Yahya Sinwar is too delay the hostage deal, let the hostages die one by one, preferably in a manner that is possible to frame Israel for it, and accept a hostage deal after the maximum damage is done. Because either way, Hamas lost, and after the war ends Hamas will have to restart from nothing, and Israel will have a time to regain minimum inner stability.   
But if delaying the hostage deal while killing hostages will continue to crunch at Israel inner cohesion, potentially even causing a greater more permanent rift in Israeli society - than that is a strategically good move from the point of Hamas."
1fdfsmd,Why the protests in Israel pushing Netanyahu to make a deal at any costs are horrible!,2024-09-10 11:43:39,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fdfsmd/why_the_protests_in_israel_pushing_netanyahu_to/,"In recent times, many have pushed for Israel to make concessions and ceasefire agreements, especially as the conflict with Hamas continues. However, I believe that pushing Netanyahu or any Israeli leadership into surrendering would ultimately lead to more harm in the future‚Äîand here‚Äôs why.

We have to think about the Jewish principle of *Rodef*, which refers to a pursuer intent on harming or killing another person. According to this principle, it is permissible‚Äîeven required‚Äîto stop the *Rodef* before they can cause harm. Hamas, with its clear intent to harm civilians and continue its campaign of violence, is undeniably a *Rodef* in this context.

If we pressure Israel‚Äôs leadership into surrendering or making hasty concessions, it won't bring peace. It may only create a temporary lull while giving Hamas the space and time to regroup, rearm, and continue pursuing their goal of harming Israel and its people. A ceasefire or surrender under these conditions might stop immediate violence but would allow a larger threat to fester and grow. This would result in more casualties and suffering down the road.

Many would argue for peace at any cost, but peace doesn‚Äôt come from negotiating with an entity that continues to call for our destruction. Any deal or ceasefire that doesn't address the root issue‚ÄîHamas‚Äô intent to eradicate Israel‚Äîwon‚Äôt solve the conflict and will likely lead to future bloodshed.

We need to acknowledge that Netanyahu and the Israeli government, for all their flaws, understand this reality. They cannot surrender or make concessions that would endanger the lives of millions of Israelis in the long term. Signing a deal under pressure or in the name of short-term peace would be a mistake, one that we would all regret when the cycle of violence inevitably resumes.

So, rather than push for surrender, we should focus on a solution that ensures long-term security for all people in the region. This is not a matter of being pro-Israel or pro-Palestine, but a matter of recognizing what truly leads to sustainable peace‚Äîpeace where innocent lives are not at risk from a group like Hamas, who acts as a *Rodef* to Israelis.

Let‚Äôs be cautious about short-term fixes that don‚Äôt address the bigger picture. Any real solution must ensure the safety and security of everyone involved, but pressuring Israel to surrender to an entity committed to its destruction is not the answer."

1fdcf9e,How Wikipedia distort history of IP conflict ‚Äì reflections of an editor,2024-09-10 07:48:16,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fdcf9e/how_wikipedia_distort_history_of_ip_conflict/,"I have observed repeated and eggregious instances of selective quoting and source filtering on Wikipedia. I will be discussing one example, but the problem is pervasive. Let's examine at the article [1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion_and_flight#Haifa), specifically the section covering the Battle of Haifa.

Benny Morris is, by far, the most widely cited historian throughout this page, and this section in particular. Yet his works are quoted highly selectively, without any qualification or opposite evidence that Morris adds to his claims. In some cases, the original material is distorted so much that so as to convey the *opposite* message. Large sections of his books are omitted altogether. Yet whenever I or other editors try to even out such misrepresentation, the edits get blocked because ""Morris is already quoted too much"" (as if that is the main issue) or because some segments of his books ""engage in Nakba denialism"" (and it is these particular parts that should be ignored).

For example, Morris is **rightly** quoted when it comes to instances of Haganah's uses of psychological warfare. A big quote from his 2004 book is included verbatim. Yet, a section on the very same page, where he points out that

> There is no evidence that the commanders involved hoped or expected that it would lead to mass evacuation (Morris 2004: p.300)

is dropped. Meanwhile, Ilan Papp√©'s assertion that ""this mortar barrage was deliberately aimed at civilians to precipitate their flight from Haifa"" is included directly below, without any mention that Papp√© directly contradicts Morris or that Papp√© *himself* uses Morris' research as his main source.

Furthermore, The editors consistently ignore Morris, whenever he discusses the Arab evacuation orders or when he notes that there was no centralised plan of expulsion ever promulgated by the IDF. This is despite the fact that Morris dedicates more space and primary sources in his chapter to these points than to psychological warfare. Any attempt at balancing out is ruled out. Here's an example of what was proposed and blocked:

> Truce negotiations between Haganah and the Arab leaders took place on April 22. Despite the Haganah's assurances that ""Arabs will carry on their work as equal and free citizens of Haifa and will enjoy all services along with the other members of the community,"" the Arab representatives stated that ""the Arab population wished to evacuate Haifa... man, woman and child."" According to Morris, this led Jewish officials to (incorrectly) believed that the ""unexpected exodus from Haifa"" was part of a comprehensive Arab plot to ""villify Jews"" (Morris 2004: pp. 195, 200)

> From April 22 onwards, Morris states that there is ""a surfeit of evidence"" that the Arab leaders both ordered and encouraged the evacuation (Morris 2004: 198)‚Ää Both Morris and Karsh reference British and American intelligence reports, Alan Cunningham's assessment, personal memoirs, and Haganah's assessments, that ""the Jews have been making extensive efforts to prevent wholesale evacuation,"" while the ""total evacuation is being urged on the Haifa Arabs from higher Arab quarters and that the townsfolk themselves are against it.""[2][3][4][5] Regarding the reasons for the alleged Arab encouragement of the exodus, they speculate that it was to avoid ""possibility of Haifa Arabs being used as hostages in future operations after May 15,"" and to escape ""the gearing of Transjordan's armed force for a wholesale massacre""[6][7]

A particularly blatant example of distortion occurs regarding the truce negotiations of 22 April 1948, making them out a precise opposite of what they were. The article currently states

> On 21‚Äì22 April in Haifa, after the Haganah waged a day-and-a-half battle including psychological warfare, the Jewish National Committee was unable to offer the Palestinian council assurance that an unconditional surrender would proceed without incident.

In fact, the National Committee in question was the _**Arab**_ National Committee (NC) in Haifa! Morris' provides their response to a truce deal, saying that

> The Arabs‚Äînow all Christians‚Äî ""stated that they were not in a position to sign a truce, as they had no control over the Arab military elements in the town and that... they could not fulfill the terms of the truce, even if they were to sign. They then said as an alternative that the Arab population wished to evacuate Haifa... man, woman and child."" (Morris 2004: p. 196)

Those interested can trace the discussion on the [Talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:1948_Palestinian_expulsion_and_flight#Haifa). This example provides just one instance of a persistent pattern of selective quoting and source manipulation across related Wikipedia pages. Since Benny Morris is one of the most frequently cited historian on most of them, the handling of his work is particularly eggregious. "

I'm curious to hear people's thoughts on what was happening at this time and what were the results of the developments outlined in this document.

>IV. LOOKING AHEAD 
  WBGS official labour flows to Israeli-controlled areas in the first quarter of 1999 averaged about 47,100 workers on a daily basis, about 3.5 per cent higher than during the same period in 1998 and slightly more than the 1998 average as a whole. The slower growth in labour flows may be the result of a recessionary trend in Israel. Commercial truck movements through monitored crossings during first- quarter 1999 were about 1.3 per cent below their first-quarter 1998 level. Exported truckloads were about 10 per cent below the first-quarter 1998 level while the number of imported truckloads was about 1 per cent higher on an average monthly basis. There were also no comprehensive closures imposed during first- quarter 1999.

>  These indicators suggest slower growth for 1999. Moreover, the end of the interim period in May 1999 will raise the level of uncertainty about the near future. This may hinder further progress in private investment which is sensitive to increased political uncertainty. Continued cooperation among the parties to the social and economic development process in the WBGS‚Äìthe Palestinian Authority, the Government of Israel, donors, multilateral institutions and NGOs‚Äìwill be crucial in instilling confidence in the private sector in the coming months and years."

Books are welcome, but please note that I am not asking for sources on the history of either Israel or Palestine, I am specifically asking for analyses of the current state of affairs. If a historical book has been especially illuminating for you in terms of this specific conflict, please tell me why. 

I hope this question is received in good faith; we are living in a time of fake news and cyber propaganda, and I am trying my level best."
1fd1co8,Settlement detractors who think Israel would be safe if it removed all Jews from Judea Samaria: do you see what happened in Gaza?,2024-09-09 21:40:34,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fd1co8/settlement_detractors_who_think_israel_would_be/,"This question isn't meant for antisemitic folks who want to annihilate Israel, but for those ""moderate"" pro-pal who think settlements are the root of all evil.

Doesn't the murder of non-settlers on October 7th tell you something? Do you understand it's Jews that Muslims are after?

Israel removed every single Jew from Gaza in 2005 because Muslims can't stand living with jews. But apparently they also can't stand knowing Jews exist nearby at all since as soon as Hamas was elected they started launching rockets at civilian Israeli areas. Not at settlements, but indeed at Israel.

In addition to Efrat Katz there are a couple of friendly fire killings including two civilians at Pessi Cohen's home. And two more by mistaken identification by the police.

Now I'm going to explain why there was no mass Hannibal :

1 Most of the victims of 7.10 are known as to how and where their bodies were found:

2 Most of the hostages in Pessi Cohen's house, except 2 were already dead when the tank hit the house as we know, the deceased Arnon Zamora tried to enter the house and save the hostages. He communicated with a woman hostage who was still alive, who informed him that her children and the rest of the hostages in the house had been executed. Shortly after she was also killed by the terrorists.

3  All the accusations about helicopter fire on the border ignore the huge number of terrorists who managed to get in and out unharmed.

On August 31, it was revealed that 6,000 managed to get across. 1,500 were killed and 200 were arrested alive.

4 [https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/b111niukzt](https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/b111niukzt)

This article is used to prove that IAF was shooting at cars full of hostages. Not so, they wanted to stop the flow from Gaza to Israel. Looking at point 3 they did a terrible job.

One of the reasons why 7.10 was so bloody is because there were not enough forces at the border. The victims were killed because there was no one to protect them.

Reinforcements arrived at 12:00 pm. By this time most were dead.

The victims of 7.10 deserve respect, not conspiracy theories.

So long as he's pro Israel(or pro the far right radicals who control Israel) and sufficiently denigrating to anything pro Palestine he's not placed under any scrutiny. Israel doesn't pressure him to clamp down on the actual hate speech. He can say jews are trying to replace white people with mass immigrantion, that's fine, so long as he comes back up Netanyu when he comes demanding congress for money and crying about progressives .
Elon‚Äôs actual anti-semitism isn't an isnt an issue--only his allegiance to Israel.  
Now on the lobbying groups; Majore Taylor green literally held a hate rally with white nationalists who love Hitler and praised Hitler at the rally. AIPAC and other pro Israeli lobbying did not attempt to primary her, push for her expulsion from congress. They did spend tens of millions to her. If these groups cared about anti-semitism you'd expect shed get the bowman treatment. She didn't. Because she's a popular Republican.
I personally don't care for Israel one way or the other‚Äîi don't see it as a unique evil or shining beacon of western civilization to drool over.

The crazy thing is Gotliv is not just suggesting a slap on the wrist here; she‚Äôs talking about invoking laws used for wartime collaboration meaning Novak could be looking at some serious consequences, including life in prison or even the death penalty. 

This is weird. Can you imagine being part of a human rights group and constantly looking over your shoulder, wondering if what you say might land you in court or worse? It‚Äôs like the space for criticism, or even just debate, is shrinking fast. I mean, when speaking out becomes something dangerous, you can only imagine the space that is left for human rights abuses to naturally occur. Imagine s'teiman abuses but this time without whistleblowers. Consider the situation in the WB.  it is really ramping up tensions between the Israeli government and human rights organizations. These groups have already been vocal in their criticisms of Israel‚Äôs military actions, and now the stakes feel even higher. It‚Äôs not just about one person or one speech this could set a precedent for how dissent is treated moving forward. for real, there are plenty of people who won‚Äôt want to risk speaking out if this is what might happen. Injustices will flow unimpeded. These restrictions of freedoms, can it really be compatible with democracy's considering that free speech, att least within reason considering differnt countries legislate or chose not to legislate it differently, is integral to the whole democratic process.

 I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this complicates Israel‚Äôs diplomatic relations. There‚Äôs always been this balancing act between maintaining security and upholding democracy but I think many will start questioning how long that balance can last. But you know what really hits me. How many activists, journalists, or regular citizens will start feeling like they need to be careful about what they say? And when people feel like they can't express themselves freely, it doesn‚Äôt just affect public discourse it impacts the very fabric of society. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs really at stake here, and I gotta say Is this how the future of dialogue in Israel looks? Will fear start dictating the limits of free speech? Is this not another example of how apartheid structures and the notion of democracy are not able to fit within a country identity, its one or the other

1fck0vx,"What if Israel annex the West Bank (Area A, B, C) just like it did to East Jerusalem ?",2024-09-09 07:48:57,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fck0vx/what_if_israel_annex_the_west_bank_area_a_b_c/,"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/16/israel-minister-demands-west-bank-annexation-if-un-court-rules-against-it

Smotrich only wanted to annex Area C, he wants the land, not the people. I am suggesting annex Area A, B and C. Most people complaint about West Bank and Gaza, you seldom hear very hard criticism of treatment of Israeli Arabs living in Israel.

1. There will be an outcry from the international community. Some condemnation from UN. It will probably be illegal under international law. Same as East Jerusalem, Crimea, Donbas, West Papua, Tibet etc‚Ä¶ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation  similarly in the case of East Jerusalem, draw up some law to legalize the annexation. 

2. It will squash any accusation of Apartheid. Give everyone voting rights. Offer everyone Israeli citizenship (just like in the East Jerusalem, some will take it, some wont, you cant force them to take Israeli citizenship if they dont want to). Give them Permanent Residency, right to move, right to work etc‚Ä¶ it cant be Apartheid if there is no racial segregation, everyone can vote.

3. Israel needs to change the demographic of West Bank. Encourage Israeli Jews to make alot more babies, need to encourage overseas jews to perform their aliya (there is a rise in anti-sematism all around the world, some might wanna get out and move to Israel, there are 300,000 jews in Russia, 300,000 jews in UK (with the riots in UK), 9 million jews in USA (pitch to the American Jews left wing, if enough left wing American jews were to migrate to Israel, it could swing Israel politics from right back to left, best way to rein in on far right wing is to change Israel demographics from within and overseas jews can do it), you will need about 2 million jews to move into West Bank. There are 3 million arab palestinians currently in the West Bank, but 1/3 of them or 1 million are Palestinian refugees and their descendents registered under UNRWA from 1948 and 1967. You can grant these 1 million a one off the right of return, if they take it‚Ä¶they can move into Israel proper (dont force or expel them‚Ä¶.they been calling for right or return for 70+ years, give them). Then call a referendum to formalize the annexation like how Putin did it, you need 51% of West Bank residents to agree to the annexation. When you get the referendum,‚Ä¶ is it still illegal annexation if that is what the majority of the residents want ? 

4. You need to reinterpret some part of history, from the Israel side. For the longest time, Israel didnt lay claim the West Bank and agrees to the green line, armistice 1949 lines. That needs to change. Israel will now need to argue that West Bank is an inalienable part of Israel since ancient times, and the State of Israel is the only true succesor government of the British Mandatory of Palestine. (I.e. West Bank was part of the British Mandatory of Palestine, and as the legitime succesor government, the State of Israel also lay claims of the West Bank). Just follow the People‚Äôs Republic of China‚Äôs talking points‚Ä¶ every map since ancient times will not carve out ‚ÄúWest Bank‚Äù to be a separate nation, not the Ottoman maps, not the British Mandatory of Palestine Map, etc‚Ä¶ you will need to hire some good lawyers to fight this, then it is no longer ‚Äúillegal occupation‚Äù, how can you illegal occupy a land which originally belonged to you ? 

5. There will be no genocide in the West Bank. No intent to kill any group. You want to integrate them into Israeli society like Jerusalemite.

6. It solves the problem who to deal with from the Palestine side ? Maybe PLO will still be around, as a political party. But you can now encourage new Israeli Arab parties from the West Bank, clean, non-corrupt, progressive, secular, inclusive, and unseat PLO‚Äôs monopoly in Palestinian politics. The people in West Bank can vote. Of course, terrorists groups like Hamas are outlawed and banned. 

7. Kick out UNRWA. All the education will now be handled by the State of Israel. Free public education for all students, promoting tolerance, peace, co-existance, secularism, etc‚Ä¶https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLEqZjJjKH0 this is a group of jerusalem youth choir made up of Israelis (Jews) and (Arabs) Palestinian youths ‚Ä¶this can only happen without UNRWA.

8. Prepare for elections 12-24 months after annexation, have a road map. Start to gradually in phases pull down the barriers, checkpoints, walls, ‚Ä¶change the situation from what is now to something freer, more normal, more like East Jerusalem. Root out any remnants of terrorism, no need to hold them in detention without charge, just exile them. 

9. Start publishing newspaper in Arabic, TV news in Arabic, ban Al-Jazeera, you need to control the narrative and information. Noticed how many Hamas related journalists were in Gaza, at least Hamas knows the power of the media. You want to deradicalize the population, you need the media. 

10. Demographic. Currently over 7million jews in Israel. 2 million arabs israelis. 3 million arabs in west bank. The State of Israel will still be majority Jewish after annexation of the West Bank (5,860 km2). I dont have a solution for Gaza Strip (360 km2). Gaza Strip is 16 times smaller than the West Bank and Gaza Strip is less important compared to the West Bank (Judea and Samaria). The Tomb of the Patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob are in the West Bank, not in Gaza.

11. This can be done better with Trump in the White House, or wait for another Trump like US President. With the help of the American left wing uncommitted movement, if Trump do gets into the White House. Start making plans to annex the West Bank. Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel‚Äôs capital, Trump will recognize Israel‚Äôs claim on the West Bank. Trump‚Äôs Israel adviser suggests diverting $1 billion from Palestinian aid to fund West Bank annexation https://forward.com/fast-forward/649830/david-friedman-book-donald-trump-israel-wes-bank-annexation/

12. Yes effectively the two state solution will be in the bin. Many critics have already said for many many years two state solution has failed. There is no perfect solution in this conflict to make everyone happy‚Ä¶. at the very least this way, the people of West Bank will not be ‚Äústateless‚Äù, they will be Israeli, they will be free to move, there will be no walls/checkpoints/‚Ä¶ they will have passports, they can travel, they can vote, etc‚Ä¶ 

13. It will be more like a one state solution like what many pro-palestinian supporters wanted, from the river to the sea (except Gaza). But still jewish majority, still State of Israel. With the annexation of the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority will disolved. They may participate in the local elections and become party of the Israeli Arab community, or they or another organization may establish a government in exile. 

14. Israeli settlements in the west bank or hill top youth violence should end. There is no need to stake their claim to the land anymore, the State of Israel will officially annex them. The best thing the hill top youths can do is settle down and make more  jewish babies. You dont need to worry about pulling out 700,000 israeli settlers out of the West Bank. "

1fcawmu,So those pro Palestinians literally think that this is the way they will liberate Palestinian? Ironic and hypocrite ,2024-09-08 23:03:49,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fcawmu/so_those_pro_palestinians_literally_think_that/,"1. They attack Jews just anywhere in this world. Then, when these Jews report it and get the news out, they talk about pretending to be the victim. I'm clearly Turkish, and so a Syrian realized I was a convert to Noahidism. He threatened me to speak the shahada out because Muslims would one day kill every single Jew. 
If you leave us alone, you don't even have to pay attention to antisemitism. You will not hear anything about us. Like since when attacked a Jew Muslims for the attack in Brussels. 
And as if it couldn't be weirder, they try to defend themselves by saying, ""I am a Semite."" Like, is peanut butter really butter with pieces of peanut too?

2. Neutrality is also totally unaccepted. How many times have I been called, when I was a Muslim, kafir (infidel) or dog of Israel for being against war. I said I was against war based on Surah Fussilat 41:34. They want war. Nothing else

3. In the week when Ismail Haniyeh was killed, I met an old friend. It was a Friday, and he invited me to Friday prayers. I said I was no longer a Muslim but out of respect, I went with him to the mosque. I sat there on the floor in a corner, and during the sermon, the imam said very racist things against Jews. Apparently, even a Jew who converts to the Islamic faith would remain cursed. And he said things like what Ismail Haniyeh said.

4. Anything Jewish or related to Judaism they want to boycott. That's not weird. In fact, I see boycott just anything a way of support. But they act as if it's an honour. And some go so far as to attack Starbucks or the like. Starbucks doesn't even operate in Israel

5. They literally attacked a random vegetarian restaurant in Groningen with graffiti that said Free Gaza. And he has nothing to do with the Middle East. So they attacked several restaurants in Groningen with pro-Palestinian slogans but they're just random restaurants.

6. They themselves sit around hating Israel for committing genocide. But someone called for attacking all Israelis, Israel supporters and Zionists

7. Since 7 October. They attacked hundreds of Jewish restaurants, synagogues, shops etc etc etc. They wanna destroy the Jews 

Is this how you think of liberating Palestine? Even if I am a pro Israeli and then? Am I obligated to have the same opinion as you then? Complaining about Israel being an apartheid state but you yourself can't even stand another opinion or a different ideology. You make up everything yourself in your book and force us to accept it. You even turn Jesus into a political figure. Is this how you think you will liberate Palestine? 

You all are hypocrite and ironic

Crying about a apartheid state but you self can't accept that Jews have a state or you can't stand a different opinion. 
Crying about ""acting as a victim"" while yourself make the problem
Crying that Israel is commiting a genocide but you wish dead to every Jew, Zionist and pro Israeli

And to make it complete. You all say that you're not anti Semitic or don't have problem with Jews but you're mocking with the Torah with saying ""those are the chosen one""

Edit: I don't have a English keyboard on this phone so I forgot there was no autocorrect. I meant ""Palestinians""

If you were Biden/Harris, what would be your chief aim over the next couple of months concerning the Israel-Palestine Crisis?

This is a critical question because the Biden administration is caught between several difficult choices that need to balance domestic interests, international diplomacy, and humanitarian concerns. On the one hand, they are trying to navigate U.S. alliances with Israel, while on the other, they are facing increasing pressure to address Palestinian grievances and the growing humanitarian crisis.

Some possible aims might include pushing for a ceasefire, supporting diplomatic talks between both sides, or providing more humanitarian aid to the affected populations. Additionally, they may need to reassess America's broader Middle East strategy and the influence that countries like Iran or Russia might have in the conflict. Addressing domestic public opinion and maintaining bipartisan support could also be an essential aim in the near future.

Now, let's discuss what has been the administration‚Äôs biggest PR failure in handling this crisis. From a communication perspective, it seems that the administration has struggled to maintain a clear and consistent message. While Biden has reaffirmed support for Israel's right to defend itself, he has been criticized for not doing enough to address the suffering of Palestinian civilians. The lack of a nuanced approach in public statements has contributed to growing dissatisfaction among progressive Democrats, and there's a sense that the administration is failing to provide a strong humanitarian counter-narrative. This is particularly important considering the increasing global awareness of human rights violations on both sides.

What do you think would be the most effective approach from strictly a PR perspective?

A total reform of the school system will be needed if Palestinians will ever be able to have peace. 

Jew hating and killing is a real part of the Palestinian curriculum. Here's a bunch of posts and videos, Palestinians are not shy about recording and publishing this stuff, it's a point of pride in their society.

Here's a Gazan describing how they were taught to honor and glorify people who killed civilians in cold blood as a child:

""I recall my teacher's response when I asked, ""But isn't it ""Haram"" (religiously forbidden) to kill those children?"" After mocking me, my teacher said that if they had adhered to Dalal's demands, they would not have been killed.""

"" On the school FB page they proudly wrote: ""On Arab Children's Day... we salute the children of Palestine who carry their favorite game and their favorite doll, which are the machine gun and the rifle, in this event of the 1st grade""

In Palestine, religious extremism really is the root cause of their issues. Their ideology says that dying a martyr is totally worth it since then you get a righteous afterlife. And their school system reinforces this constantly.

When Hamas was killing civilians on 10/7, they weren't saying ""free gaza"", they were saying how glorious it was to god to kill Jews. They didn't call their parents to say, ""You'll be free soon, mom!"" it's, ""I killed 10 jews mom, be proud of me""!"
1fbzjh7,Why the IDF is committing war crimes in Gaza,2024-09-08 14:49:32,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fbzjh7/why_the_idf_is_committing_war_crimes_in_gaza/,"I decided to give a few reasons on why the IDF commits war crimes in Gaza.

So to start, it's gonna be a disproportionate use of force. As we already know, International law requires that military actions be ""proportionate to the threat posed."" Israel responds to rocket attacks from Gaza with disproportionate force, causing extraordinary civilian casualties relative to the military objectives achieved.

IDF has also committed indiscriminate attacks. Israel‚Äôs airstrikes and artillery usage in densely populated civilian areas (homes, schools, hospitals) has been indiscriminate, violating the ""principle of distinction"" in international humanitarian law, which requires the military to distinguish between civilian and military targets.

Israel has been deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure such as water supplies, medical facilities, and power plants, which amounts to collective punishment and violates international law.

Israel's blockade of Gaza is restricting the movement of goods and people, and is a form of collective punishment, prohibited under international law. It restricts the flow of supplies such as food, medicine, and fuel. The blockade createa severe humanitarian suffering.

Israel‚Äôs frequently claims that it warns civilians before attacks (through leaflets, phone calls, etc.), The warnings are insufficient in the context of dense urban areas, where civilians very often have nowhere safe to evacuate. In some instances, no warnings were issued at all

The use of artillery, bombs, and drones in densely populated areas is excessive.

Israel has also used white phosphorus on civilians in Gaza. Even though the usage not inherently illegal in military campaigns, the specific use case of this compound in Gaza very likely violates the international law.

There are legitimate use cases for white phosphorus in military purposes such as:

* ""Creating smoke screens to obscure troop movements.""
* ""Illuminating areas during nighttime operations.""

But, white phosphorus becomes undeniably illegal if used in a way that targets civilians or civilian areas. In the case of Gaza, it's a valid point to address that ""it is prohibited to use incendiary weapons like white phosphorus in heavily populated civilian areas.""

Here are the reliable citations to back up the fact that use of white phosphorus in civilian areas violates international law:

**Protocol III of the CCW (1980)**:

* ""It is prohibited in all circumstances to make any military objective located within a concentration of civilians the object of attack by air-delivered incendiary weapons.""

**Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol I (1977)**:

* Article 35(2) of Additional Protocol I prohibits the use of weapons that cause ""superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering.""

1fbrmzk, Reflecting on the Israel-Palestine Conflict: Searching for Understanding,2024-09-08 06:46:35,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fbrmzk/reflecting_on_the_israelpalestine_conflict/,"The current situation in Palestine is beyond devastating, and my heart goes out to everyone caught in the crossfire. The level of violence and loss of life is unimaginable. I never thought things would escalate this far, and it‚Äôs truly heartbreaking to see so many innocent people suffering. It‚Äôs hard to comprehend the fear and devastation families must be going through right now, and the sheer loss of life is deeply unsettling.

As I reflect on what‚Äôs happening, I can‚Äôt help but be reminded of other significant moments in history, particularly the trauma Jewish people endured during the Holocaust. I don‚Äôt want to diminish or compare tragedies, but the sheer loss of life and the atmosphere of fear does have some echoes of that dark chapter. The Holocaust was one of the most horrific events in human history, with 6 million Jews killed by the Nazis. It‚Äôs understandable that such a horrific experience would leave lasting scars and shape the mindset of a nation, especially when it comes to matters of security and survival. There‚Äôs undoubtedly a deep-seated fear and mistrust that stems from the past, and that can influence current actions and policies.

That being said, it‚Äôs also clear that the current violence in Palestine is unjustifiable. No historical trauma can excuse the killing of hundreds of civilians or the destruction of communities. It feels like the response to any disagreement has been conditioned to rely on violence and war, and I wonder if that‚Äôs partly because conflict has become such a constant in the region. When war and hostility are so embedded in history, it seems like it becomes the default way to handle disputes, even when peaceful solutions could be possible.

It‚Äôs also worth considering that Palestine had nothing to do with the Holocaust, yet they seem to be caught in a cycle of violence that is deeply connected to the aftermath of World War II and the complex political realities that followed. I wonder if some of the tension today stems from unresolved trauma or resentment that has been carried over generations. While this is just a theory, I think it‚Äôs important to explore the deeper psychological and historical roots of the conflict.

At the end of the day, I don‚Äôt claim to have the answers. I just feel deeply saddened by what‚Äôs happening and want to make sense of it all. What do others think? Could these historical factors be influencing the current situation, or is it just the nature of conflict in such a deeply divided region? I‚Äôd love to hear different perspectives on this because it‚Äôs such a complex and tragic issue."

**Therefore, what was the logic behind Israel thoroughly cleaning up the West in 1948 but did not do the same to the East in 1967?**

Because of that, the conflict still persists today, Jerusalem feels like a divided city and there is a lot of terrorism going on. It was at least good that the Jews built the wall between Wadi Qadum and Abu Dis on E-Sheikh street otherwise who know what sort of weapons could be flowing into the capital."
1fbcxfr,Exposed: Hamas negotiation & manipulation strategy,2024-09-07 17:55:23,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fbcxfr/exposed_hamas_negotiation_manipulation_strategy/,"A document was found on a laptop which is believed to be of Yahya Sinwar. The letter is dated from Spring 2024.

Negotiation Points

* The ""capacity of our armed forces"" to operate against Israel must be maintained,
* the Israeli political and military apparatus must be ""exhausted"" and international pressure on Israel must be ""increased"".
* Important clauses in the agreement should be improved, even if the negotiations continue over a longer period of time.
   * (Note that a quick end to the war or Gazan suffering is unimportant here)
* Continue to exert psychological pressure on the families of the prisoners, both now and during the first phase *(of the ceasefire, ed.)* , so that public pressure on the enemy government (Israel) increases.
* During the negotiations for the second phase *(of the ceasefire, ed.),* Hamas will allow the Red Cross to visit some of the prisoners as a gesture of goodwill and to convey messages to their relatives.
   * Do note the use of the word *some*
* Hamas also lists important demands on Israel, such as the release of 100 murderers and terrorists serving life sentences in Israel (replacing lost commanders).
* Hamas negotiators should propose that ""Arab forces be stationed along the eastern and northern borders"" with Israel. But these would only have one purpose: ""The Arab forces should serve as a buffer to prevent the enemy from entering Gaza after the war ends until they *(Hamas, ed.)* have reorganized their ranks and military capabilities.""
* Israel should be held solely responsible for the unsuccessful negotiations. Hamas' message to the media should be that Israel rejected a deal that was brought in by the USA. The media must be made aware that Hamas agreed, but that the deal failed due to ""Israel's stubbornness"". Hamas should not be ""held responsible for the failure of an agreement"".
   * (Hamas shouldn't be held responsible for anything, even ""losing"" previous wars/engagements. Any criticism is punished so people learn to be quiet or potentially die)

not included in the document is the ""Philadelphi Corridor"", which has been the subject of negotiations for weeks, is not mentioned. Yet Hamas is currently acting as if it were its highest priority.

The supply corridor separates Gaza from Egypt. Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu wants the army to control it. Hamas does not want to accept this and is demanding a troop withdrawal. The corridor has now become one of the most sensitive points in the negotiations, and the USA, among others, is putting strong pressure on Israel.

We have occasionally discussed the events happening in Gaza over the past year, and generally we are in agreement that as the conflict has gone on, we think that Israel is becoming increasingly unjustified in their occupation and invasion. I've given him information on some historical events that lead up to Oct. 7 and that's about it, it's been limited to just 10-15 minute convos. At a recent family dinner, some others got to the topic of political correctness in media, and how it's ruining the fabric of western society or something. He basically started to say how it's Jewish people that control the media and that they're harming society. I think both of those things are obviously untrue. 

He's never brought up Israel before this year, and I'm strictly anti-zionist, so I think he started to consume anti-semetic viewpoints somewhere along the way. What makes it more difficult is that he only reads news in Chinese and barely reads english sources. I'm conversational, but I don't have the vocabulary to go through the media he watches. Does anyone here have experience talking to family members that have gone down anti-semetic rabbit holes? Does anyone have sources I can use to educate him on the topic?

1favfh3,There seems to be a double standard ,2024-09-07 01:21:38,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1favfh3/there_seems_to_be_a_double_standard/,"I'm sorry I'm not the best at articulating what I'm trying to say but here goes.  

But it seems like the IDF(and Israel) is held to a higher level of criticism than Hamas. Everyday I hear something ""bad"" that Israel did. 9 times out of 10 it was something completely justifiable or just flat out a lie. But Hamas can literally target civilians or kill their own civilians and no one says anything. It seems Hamas is getting away with horrible things but people aren't criticizing it at all. In fact they get praised for some of the awful things they do. On the other hand every move or mistake Israel makes gets blasted everywhere. 

With that said, there is also massive misinformation and propaganda campaigns that really paint Israel in a bad light. Obviously, both sides do put out propaganda but it seems like Hamas has a very strong and effective propaganda campaign going, while Israel doesnt seem to be dispelling any of the misinformation and if they do it's delayed. Is it important for Israel to dispell some of the propaganda? When speaking to people about Palestine it seems like their arguments and talking points are flooded with misinformation and they are not changing their minds. In the long run, will this information warfare affect the worlds perception to the point where it could change the outcome for the worse? If so is there more that should be done to combat this?

I'm trying to wrap my head around it because I get so frustrated reading articles or hearing news reports and journalists completely lie and people believe it without question. Many things Israel gets accused of is the very things Hamas are guilty of. 
Is there a solution to this? It seems this is damaging Israel's reputation so shouldn't there be a higher importance place on combatting this?

P.S also I've ran into people that don't even understand basic facts. For example, people are condemning the Jenin operation and think the IDF just went there to pillage and destroy, when they actually had a mission or when they say Israel killed a journalist but no one acknowledges that the journalist was actually a Hamas terrorist.

1fau98n,Could temporary international refugee camps be made in Israel?,2024-09-07 00:20:18,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fau98n/could_temporary_international_refugee_camps_be/,"I realize my idea may have many flaws and concerns but I'd a least like to float it or get responses.

If temporary tent cities were made in Israel, how many Gazans could be temporarily taken out of Gaza, if they wished, to avoid the war? I realize this would require massive security measures, and might even have to be limited to women and children, or maybe even just children. Are there international agencies that would finance this? Would UNRWA override/not cooperate with this? Obviously this would be contingent on them returning to Gaza and could be used as a front, but in all my thinking this is really one of the only things I could think of to get civilians out of Harms way and try to foster some kind of connection between Palestinians and Israelis. I'd imagine could be a lot of volunteer, outreach and education opportunities to try to a least get children away form UNRWA brainwashing.

Are there Israelis that would support this? Would Gazans accept this? I'm not sure of the demographics of the politics in Israel and how right leaning it all is. I do know there are some number of ""peacenics"" that might support it.  I know there must be some number of Gazans that oppose Hamas and just want to avoid the war.

  
Thanks in advance for any input."
1fapse5,People who support Israel don't put themselves in Palestinians shoes,2024-09-06 20:55:24,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fapse5/people_who_support_israel_dont_put_themselves_in/,"I'm sick and tired of seeing people on the internet treating Palestinians as animals who can't be reasoned with and can't help but want to kill a jew once they see one. Like what is wrong with you people! 

People always say but Israeli security, Israel has to do this for security. Ok, BUT WHAT ABOUT PALESTINIANS SECURITY! I find it fucking ironic that the way both sides look at each other is probably similar, they view each other as murderous psychotic rapists.

 It's always mentioned how Palestinians should be guarded against because they can't help but think about how to kill jews 24/7. Ok, and Palestinians should not guard against israel because of what? Because Israel is civilized? it's fucking ridiculous.

 It's always mentioned how it's Gazans fault because they kicked out settlers in 2007. Well, duh. Who the fuck wanted psychos with guns who can't be trusted around them? Do you guys hate Islamic terrorists? Well, how about having one live near you, because that's how palestinians fucking feel. 

It's always mentioned how Palestinians are indoctrinated to hate jews and kill them. Do you realize that the UN is in charge of education there? And do you realize that if there was evidence of this, journalists would've never stopped reporting about it? People who believe this crap have such a cartoonish view of the world.

It's always mentioned how Hamas needed to be destroyed regardless of the price because their main aim is destroying Israel. Not to mention that Hamas changed their official position to just wanting a Palestinian state, even if they're lying, so fucking what? The goal of North Korea is destroying South Korea and that doesn't mean they ever will. You want to tell me that with backing of the whole fucking Europe and the US Israel should be afraid of destruction? Hamas is not fucking retarded, if Palestinians get a state they will never attack Israel unless they're attacked first or are sure they can destroy Israel( which will never happen).

It's always mentioned how Islam is at fault, that Islam is a religion of terror. I'm an atheist Egyptian who left Islam, but I don't hate Islam. The main reason why I left Islam is simply because I can't be convinced that god exists and I don't want to hypocritically claim I'm a non-practicing muslim like many do. Islam has many valuable teachings that are taught today like caring for the weak and needy, being truthful and forgiving, etc. I don't give a fuck how the ancients practiced Islam since religion is interpreted by people and that's what matters. Islamic teachings today have evolved with the times and religion is not static. Judiasm and christianty are the same, there're many interpretations and practices that have been abandoned since ancient times, why do you think Islam is different? I'm of the belief that religion will become less relevant with time especially with the existence of the internet, but there's a need for a process; the internet only existed for a couple of decades and there're still many people unable to access it due to economic constraints around the world. However, humans have a tendency where the more you disrespect their beliefs, the more they cling to it. The Jews are the prime example of this as they kept their beliefs for thousands of years despite all the odds. And honestly Hamas has been mainly using Islam as a tool of cultivating fearless fighters, since it's so difficult to rally people into sacrficing their life. This is another point I wanted to make, why do you think it's so easy for Palestinians to sacrifice their life to kill jews? Today we live such comfortable lives and no one wants to die especially in such a comfortable era. Palestinians are also human and don't ever think they all want to throw away their lives for allahu akbar or whatever.

If after reading all that, you still believe that Palestinians are the only ones at fault here, then there's probably nothing I can ever say that will change your mind. I just want to say that we're all humans before we're muslims, Jews, atheists or whatever. And humans all share similar behaviour patterns. Just put yourself in place of Palestinians and you'll understand all their behaviours are HUMAN behaviours of people feeling insecure and resentful.

These Jews are getting thoroughly beaten up by the police, lol, while they still try to sit there and block the train and prevent everyone from getting to their destinations. It seem that the police whacked their behind with the sticks, but they insist on going back to sit there again and get whacked more. 



What do these Jews think? That studying the Torah offers them some kind of spiritual protection? And some of the denominations in Mea Shearim put up stickers of the Palestine flag and refuse to place the flag of Israel is many places claiming that only God can decide about the Jewish State. Pathetic! I certainly cannot understand how these folks with funny hats wish to live in the Jewish state and depend on welfare and subsidies to read their books and breed while their counterparts have to serve in the trenches of Rafah and dangerous areas in Judea and Samaria. 



It is certainly very good that the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of them having to serve, I definitely would have been mad if they had not. There can be no exception especially in this crucial time. If these Jews do not like it, they can move somewhere else in Europe and USA. No welfare and rampant anti-semitism, let's see how they like it! "
1fajq83,There is Something Strange Going on With Reports About the Death of Aysenur Eygi,2024-09-06 16:40:04,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fajq83/there_is_something_strange_going_on_with_reports/,"Edit: With the clarification of Secretary Blinken, it appears as though the death of Aysengur Eygi was either an incident of mis-aiming or murder.  Either way, it's a great tragedy.  I hope whoever was responsible faces punishment.



There is something very strange about reports on the death of Aysenur Eygi, a Turkish-American woman who went to protest in the West Bank with the International Solidarity Movement.

The only consistent details seem to be that this occurred in Beita, near Nablus, and that two people were killed.

We have several different sources providing different coverage.  Many sources report that there was rock and stone throwing.

BBC: [https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx6771gyqzo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx6771gyqzo)

>Ms Ezgi Eygi was allegedly shot by Israeli troops, according to local media reports. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say they ""responded with fire toward a main instigator of violent activity who hurled rocks at the forces and posed a threat to them"" in the Beita area.

...

>The Turkish foreign ministry described her death as ""murder"", adding that Ms Ezgi Eygi was ""killed by Israeli occupation soldiers in the city of Nablus"".

>The¬†activist was rushed to a hospital in Nablus with a gunshot to the head and was later pronounced dead, AFP news agency reported.

>Dr Fouad Naffa, head of the hospital to which Ms Ezgi Eygi was admitted, confirmed that a US citizen in her mid-20s died from a ""gunshot in the head"".

Jerusalem Post: [https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-819011](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-819011)

>

The Israeli military stated that during a violent public disorder, stones were thrown at IDF forces, who responded by shooting at the lower body of the main instigator of the rioters, according to the IDF.

>Additionally, the Israeli military said it was investigating the reports, emphasizing that the details of the incident and the circumstances in which she was hit are under review.

Times of Israel: [https://www.timesofisrael.com/american-turkish-activist-said-shot-dead-by-idf-troops-at-west-bank-protest/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/american-turkish-activist-said-shot-dead-by-idf-troops-at-west-bank-protest/)

>According to the IDF, during operations near the town of Beita close to Nablus, troops opened fire at a ‚Äúmain instigator‚Äù who was hurling stones at the forces and had ‚Äúposed a threat.‚Äù

>‚ÄúA claim that a foreign citizen was killed by gunfire in the area is being investigated. The details of the incident and the circumstances of her being hit are under investigation,‚Äù the IDF added.

And as I wrote this post, the NYT edited its story to include the bit about throwing stones.  They added a ton of other details, matching the details from the Washington Post - cited afterwards

[https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/06/world/israel-hamas-gaza-war/west-bank-us-protester-killed-aysenur-eygi?smid=url-share](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/06/world/israel-hamas-gaza-war/west-bank-us-protester-killed-aysenur-eygi?smid=url-share)

>On Friday, the Israeli military said soldiers had ‚Äúresponded with fire toward a main instigator of violent activity‚Äù who threw stones at Israeli forces, endangering them. Witnesses on the scene did not deny that some had hurled rocks at Israeli troops but said the clashes were long over when Ms. Eygi was shot.

>The protest began around noon, with dozens of residents and a smattering of international activists, including Ms. Eygi rallying near Jabal Sbeih, the hilltop upon which Evyatar sits, witnesses said.

>Some demonstrators hurled stones at Israeli soldiers some distance away, to which the soldiers responded by firing tear gas and some bullets, said Hisham al-Dweikat, a Beita resident who attended the demonstration. They then headed back roughly 200 meters into the built-up outskirts of the town, away from the troops, he added.

>Israeli troops remained in roughly the same position, also taking over the rooftop of a nearby building, said Jonathan Pollak, a hard-left Israeli activist who was at the demonstration. By then, people had mostly scattered and there were no clashes in the area, he said.

>About a half an hour after the demonstrators had retreated, Mr. Pollak said he saw one of the soldiers on the roof fire a single gunshot. He immediately took cover as he heard a second gunshot, he added.

>One wounded a Palestinian, he said. No information about that person‚Äôs condition was immediately available.

>The other hit Ms. Eygi ‚Äî who was standing roughly 50 feet away from Mr. Pollak ‚Äî in the head, he said.

>‚ÄúI put my hand on the back of her head to try and stop the bleeding,‚Äù said Mr. Pollak. ‚ÄúShe had a very weak pulse.‚Äù

>Ms. Eygi was rushed to a local clinic in Beita before being taken by ambulance to the largest nearby city, Nablus. By the time she arrived, she was no longer breathing, said Dr. Nafia, the hospital director.

What the NY Times didn't say is that Jonathan Pollack  - the ""hard left activist"" who was at the  demonstration - was a member of International Solidarity Movement, the group that was with them throwing stones.  The Washington Post does.

Washington Post: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/06/west-bank-american-idf-aysenur-eygi/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/06/west-bank-american-idf-aysenur-eygi/)

>The woman, Aysenur Eygi, a 26-year old volunteer with the International Solidarity Movement, a pro-Palestinian activist group, had been attending a protest against Jewish settlement expansion in the town of Beita when she was shot, her colleagues said. Copies of her passport that circulated online said she was born in Turkey and the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement that she was a citizen.

...

>Jonathan Pollak, a volunteer with ISM, said the shooting took place about 30 minutes after protesters had dispersed, at a time when there were no active clashes taking place, and as foreign volunteers, including Eygi, stood observing at a distance of about 200 yards from the Israeli military.

>‚ÄúThere was no justification for taking that shot,‚Äù he said.

>When he and his colleagues arrived in Beita on Friday, soldiers were already deployed around a site where people were set to perform Friday prayers, he said. As soon as the prayers were over, ‚Äúclashes began,‚Äù he said. The soldiers used tear gas and live ammunition ‚Äúalmost immediately.‚Äù There was also ‚Äústone throwing‚Äù at the soldiers, he said.

>The ISM activists retreated some distance away, down a hill, some 200 yards from the town where the soldiers were stationed. ‚ÄúWe stood there for about half an hour,‚Äù he said. The soldiers took over a rooftop in the town, ‚Äúa controlling rooftop‚Äù he said. Eygi was in an olive grove, according to Pollak and another ISM volunteer who spoke on condition she be identified by her first name, Mariam, for fear of retribution.

>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see her at the moment of the shooting because I was looking at the soldiers,"" said Pollak, referring to Eygi. ""I saw the soldiers shooting. I saw the flare, I saw them aiming,‚Äù he said. Both he and Mariam said there were two shots ‚Äì one that struck a metal object, and another that hit Eygi in the head.

>‚ÄúWe were clearly visible to the army, there was nothing happening where were standing,‚Äù said Mariam. ‚ÄúWe were internationals,‚Äù she said adding that Palestinian youth who had clashed with the soldiers were much further away, up the hill. ‚ÄúWe were just standing there,‚Äù she said.

If it's as these protesters describe, then it was a tragedy and murder for Eygi to be shot from hundreds of yards away by a sniper.

If it's as the IDF says, then Eygi or the other person shot - we now know that she was killed - was the main instigator and continued to pose a threat to Israeli soldiers.

I'm guessing that we won't see the results of an investigation for months.

But while the protestors seem to have a consistent story, it makes absolutely no sense to me.  I can understand why the NY Times would edit as they get more details.  But what doesn't make sense is the concealing of political affiliation - he's not just a hard left protester, he's a comrade in arms.

So which is it?  Which is more likely?  That the protesters, especially Ms. Eygi, were actively clashing with soldiers?  That they were a ""safe"" distance away and that a soldier from a rooftop sniped Ms. Eygi?  Or that this was a tragic incidence of ricochet or mis-aiming?"

An American woman was shot and killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Friday, the U.S. State Department confirmed. Palestinian doctor Dr. Ward Basalat told The Associated Press that the 26-year-old woman, identified by the State Department as Aysenur Eygi, was shot in the head and died after arriving at the hospital.

Witnesses, activists and Palestinian media said she was shot by Israeli troops while attending a pro-Palestinian demonstration against settlement expansion in the Nablus area of the northern West Bank, near the town of Beita. Israel's military said it was still looking into the incident, but it confirmed that troops had opened fire in the area.

State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement the U.S. government was aware of her death and confirmed her identity.

Why isn't there there more criticism of the IDF firing into crowds of unarmed civilians? It's not exactly an irregularity at this point, and this being their modus operandi is pretty clear given the number of civilian casualties in the just the last year."
1facvkv,Israel's systematic assault on medical facilities is a clear indication that its operation in Gaza is a genocide,2024-09-06 11:32:24,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1facvkv/israels_systematic_assault_on_medical_facilities/,"Since Oct. 7 Israel has engaged in a systematic assault on hospitals and medical facilities in Gaza. The official definition of genocide explains that an army's attempts to destroy the means of life for a civilian population constitutes as key feature of genocide. Clearly, a systematic destruction of medical facilities in Gaza represents an attack on the means of life for the population of Gaza. Therefore, the operation in Gaza should be seen as a genocide.

A lot of pro-Israel folks on this Zionist sub will try to excuse this by stating that ""there are Hamas bases in the hospitals."" Yet, Israel has never provided any actual evidence of a significant Hamas base in any hospital. If you can supply evidence of an actual base in a hospital, please do so in the comments. A couple guns on a blanket, or a tunnel under a hospital, do not count as a ""base."" A military base is a massive, military compound involving massive amounts of military equipment and extensive fortification by personnel. To date, I have seen no photos documenting anything like that. 

Additionally, a military base has a large number of military personnel guarding the base. If any of these hospitals had a Hamas ""base"" there would have been a massive, prolonged firefight between IDF and Hamas as Israel attacked the hospital. And yet, there is nothing on record of anything like that, across any of Israel's violent assaults on medical facilities."
1faaat6,Question for Pro-Palestinians: How much resistance is justified? Which goals are justified?,2024-09-06 08:38:49,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1faaat6/question_for_propalestinians_how_much_resistance/,"In most conversations regarding the Israel/Palestine conflict, pro-Palestinians often bring up the idea that Palestinian resistance is justified. After all, Israel exists on land that used to be majority Palestinian, Israel embargos Gaza, and Israel occupies the West Bank. ""Palestinians must resist! Their cause is just! What else are Palestinians supposed to do?"" is often said. Now, I agree that the Palestinian refusal to accept resolution 181 in 1947 was understandable, and I believe they were somewhat justified to attack Israel after its declaration of independence.

I say somewhat, because I also believe that most Jews that immigrated to Israel between 1870 and 1947 did so peacefully. They didn't rock up with tanks and guns, forcing the locals off their land and they didn't steal it. For the most part, they legally bought the land. I am actually not aware of *any* instance where Palestinian land was simply stolen between 1870 and 1940 (if this was widespread and I haven't heard about it, please educate me and provide references).

Now, that said, 1947 was a long time ago. Today, there are millions of people living in Israel who were born there and don't have anywhere else to go. This makes me wonder: when people say that Palestinian resistance is justified, just how far can Palestinians go and still be justified? Quite a few people argue that October 7 - a clear war crime bordering on genocide that intentionally targeted civilians - was justified as part of the resistance. How many pro-Palestinians would agree with that?

And how much further are Palestinians justified to go? Is resistance until Israel stops its blockade of Gaza justified? What if Israel retreated to the 1967 borders, would resistance still be justified? Is resistance *always* going to be justified as long as Israel exists?

And let's assume we could wave a magic wand, make the IDF disappear and create a single state. What actions by the Palestinians would still be justified? Should they be allowed to expel anyone that can't prove they lived in Palestine before 1870?

Edit: The question I'm trying to understand is this: According to Pro-Palestinians, is there a point where the rights of the Jews that are now living in Israel and were mostly born there become equally strong and important as the rights of the Palestinians that were violated decades ago? Is there a point, e.g. the 1967 borders, where a Pro-Palestinian would say ""This is now a fair outcome, for the Palestinians to resist further would now violate the rights of the Jews born in Israel""?"

1fa79d9,How do you think modern Americans would react to 9/11 if it happened today?,2024-09-06 05:05:11,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fa79d9/how_do_you_think_modern_americans_would_react_to/,"American Jew here.  Never identified as a ‚ÄúZionist‚Äù but I‚Äôm in the two state solution camp.  I have never been a fan of Israel, but I‚Äôm also critical of my own country for similar reasons.  I hate capitalism and occupation in general, and I hate that both countries displaced large groups of people in their creation.

I have been trying to process the world‚Äôs reaction to October 7th.  I have watched the footage and it‚Äôs horrifying.  It‚Äôs sad hearing people either call it a good thing or say it didn‚Äôt happen.  It‚Äôs sad seeing people glorifying Hamas.  It hurts to see people glorifying a group that is ultimately against Jewish people (not interested in debating the 2017 charter, that was for entirely diplomatic reasons).

I would consider myself somewhat well read on middle eastern history in the 20th-21st century.  This is due to needing to understand why so many people have turned to hateful antisemitism.  I really see a lot of parallels with Hamas and Isis.  I think some people see westernism as a cancer on our world.  Growing up with antisemitism and being a victim of a hate crime, I have felt this ‚Äúotherness‚Äù before, this alienation from western society.  I could see how extreme hatred of America could lead to someone wanting to join a group that promises it‚Äôs destruction.  I look at people who eat up DPRK or Russian propaganda solely because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot American.‚Äù

It hurts that an act like 9/11 was universally condemned, and united a country against Al Qaeda, but it‚Äôs treated so differently when it happens to a Jewish country.  Western imperialism hurt many people in the Middle East and around the world, and Israel‚Äôs actions hurt many Palestinians.  But what of civilians?  Why do I hear people say that everyone should be a target?  Why is it okay to hate an entire country, instead of a country‚Äôs government?

So because of today‚Äôs climate, I wonder if people would react differently to 9/11.  Would they see it as an act of resistance?  Would they condemn it while hypocritically supporting Hamas?  Would they say that all Americans are a target because of the US government being complicit in many bad things?"
1fa5mol,Arabic/Hebrew/English Speaking Volunteers Needed for Research Project,2024-09-06 03:32:27,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1fa5mol/arabichebrewenglish_speaking_volunteers_needed/,"So, how about a detour from politics? :-)

(I hope this post isn't seen to be too off-topic. I personally believe working together on what we already have in common (like our semitic right-to-left languages) is a step we can take while we work through the harder problems.)

A colleague and myself have been working on a research project related to graphs, charts and data visualization in right-to-left languages. We are looking for volunteers to take a very short anonymouse survey. It should only take a few minutes.

The survey can be taken here: https://direction-matters.com

Thanks!

Abstract:

Much of graph perception relies on conventions that seem standard and intuitive. One such convention is that numbers on a graph increase from the bottom up and from left to right. This left-to-right directionality agrees with the left-to-right writing systems used by most of the world's population. However, around 8% of the world uses right-to-left (RTL) scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew. Previous research has shown that RTL people perceive graphical information differently from their left-to-right (LTR) counterparts.

Nevertheless, no empirical study tests how this perception differs when an RTL reader sees a graph. Here, we present a study performed with English, Hebrew, and Arabic speakers in which we measured the RTL effect on visual perception. We also provide some guidelines to mitigate the challenges that we discovered.

We constructed a series of visual stimuli to test the differences in the perception of LTR and RTL audiences. The interpretation of some of these stimuli does not depend on horizontal direction (e.g., which circle is larger). Other images require the observer to determine whether a sloped line increases or decreases. The participant needs to decide where on the graph the line begins to do so.

We constructed a website that allowed us to expose volunteers to the stimuli while asking them to select one interpretation out of three. We recorded the volunteers' demographic data, responses, and response times. We hypothesized that if RTL people are ""confused"" by their primary reading direction, we will see a larger discrepancy and slower response times than their LTR counterparts.

We collected responses from 45 English-speaking, 86 Hebrew-speaking, and 11 Arabic-speaking volunteers. We couldn't find any difference between LTR and RTL volunteers in direction-insensitive stimuli. However, the responses of RTL participants were less coherent than those of the LTR responders. Due to the lack of control over the participants' environments, we couldn't reliably measure the reading direction effect on the response speed.

In this empirical study, we demonstrated and quantified the difference in perception of horizontal direction in populations whose primary reading direction is right to left. Our results suggest that when other factors are equal, RTL readers (about 8% of the global population) will need more effort to decide the direction of a horizontal graph. We suggest mitigating this phenomenon by adding multiple visual clues of the horizontal axis directions. These clues include adding an arrow to the axis and providing numbered axis ticks.

1f9urmq,My personal view on the conflict,2024-09-05 19:14:54,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f9urmq/my_personal_view_on_the_conflict/,"I think what has happens in Gaza is horrible and sad. I don‚Äôt think all Palestinians or all Muslims or all the people in Gaza are bad. I don‚Äôt hate these people at all. 

That being said I support Israel . Israel‚Äôs war is justified. The attacks on October 7th were not the start. The six day war the Yom Kippur war the constant unguided missle barrages my Hamas over the years. This situation of Israel being attacked for having a home. Israel was under Jewish control until Romans and Egypt (separate wars/situations) took it over, over a thousand years ago. When Israel finally became a nation and the Jewish people (including me) got a home in 1948 nobody liked them then and they were immediately attacked following the announcement.

The attacks on October 7th was just the breaking point of built up attacks and aggression mainly from  the leaders of largely Muslim nations over decades. The breaking point just happened to be Hamas.

- The civilian deaths in Gaza are incredibly sad and it‚Äôs awful what those people are going through but don‚Äôt blame Israel for that blame Hamas for putting Israel in that difficult situation. Is Israel supposed to let ammunition sit in school and soldiers fire out of residential buildings. Are they supposed to just let it happen. No they fight back like anybody would. What is Israel supposed to do let Hamas kill the Israeli people without fighting back because Hamas is using a kid as a human shield. It‚Äôs awful that people are being used in that way but I also understand that this is war and these are guns being used you can‚Äôt just let your enemy gun down your men freely because they‚Äôre using a human shield. America faces the same issue in the War on Terror.

- If Israel didn‚Äôt do this attack they would of kept getting attacked over and over and over again. If this is what Israel needs to do to stop being constantly attacked then so be it.

- The people who want Palestine to be free, I hear you and understand why but Palestine was free it was only take in reparations from the six day war which was an unjust war. Similar thing as Ukraine in that specific context.

- Those people in Gaza have been raised from birth to hate Jews and Israel and just giving them Gaza back after is just gonna make a similar regime rise to power. 

- The way to end this conflict is for Israel tot take this land back, integrate these people into their society while keeping their culture. 

Overall it‚Äôs sad what‚Äôs happening and I feel for those people stuck in Gaza but don‚Äôt blame Israel for this blame Hamas and Iran for instigating this conflict and the British+French for dividing this area of land after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the end of WW1.

Edit: I‚Äôm seeing a lot of comments about Israeli soldiers raping civilians in Gaza. That is absolutely godawful and I don‚Äôt at all like that Netanyahu basically is saying it‚Äôs not a big deal. But that doesn‚Äôt change the fact I support Israel. Those soldiers in the IDF should be arrested and in my opinion executed but I don‚Äôt decide any of that. And I shouldn‚Äôt because I am inherently biased.  

Edit and remark: I said I unconditionally supported Israel. That was the wrong choice of words. That is my fault. I exaggerated something I shouldn‚Äôt have on an opinionated post backed up by facts. I do not unconditionally supported Israel but I do support them.

Edit (Some people seem to be confused on what led up to the six day war so here it is): The USSR gave false information to Egypt about Israeli brigades planning to fight Syria. Egypt then put troops on the border forcing the UN to leave Sinai. Then Egypt, Sudan and Jordan along with Israel began to mobilize their troops. Iraq sent troops to help the fight in Jordan.

The straw broke when Egypt blocked the Straits of Tiran which is when Israel then went to war 7 days later.

The USSR gave false information then Egypt, Jordan and Sudan mobilized and Egypt blocked the Straits of Turan which is Israel‚Äôs only access into the Red Sea."
1f9rvv2,"Wouldn't the US campus protests be more effective if they avoided using terms like Zionism, which the two sides seem to define differently?",2024-09-05 17:17:14,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f9rvv2/wouldnt_the_us_campus_protests_be_more_effective/,"Honest question as I have observed the conflict in the US over campus protests, and I am genuinely curious about others' perspectives. With the campus protests starting again, both sides seem to purposely create misunderstandings to escalate the situation rather than focusing on what will most effectively achieve their end goal. Protestors say they are against ""Zionism,"" but some people hear that as being against the security of Israelis and for Hamas, which they then call out as antisemitic--a term that shuts down any possibility of discussion. But what it seems like protestors want is security for Gaza and the West Bank, a demand which shouldn't be considered antisemitic.

It seems they are seeing a lot of TikTok content that defines Zionism as wanting to expand Israel into Gaza and the West Bank. I've heard similar disagreement about ""From the river to the sea.""

And then I hear anti-protestors pointedly ignoring the protestors' concerns about the security of Palestinians while calling the protests antisemitic because they hear terms like anti-zionist and point to actions by a small minority of protestors.

Wouldn't it be more effective for the protestors' goals if they avoided the term Zionism or similar terms that aren't mutually defined and instead kept the message clear that they want Israel to stop harming civilians in Gaza and the West Bank?"

To win in other ways I imagine their best bet is to make the international community hate Israel (I would say Zionism here, but I'm not sure on the distinction). I believe they could make fair progress in this direction by

1. Dis-owning the attacks on civilians on Oct. 7 (especially the music festival etc.), and making some effort to discipline those who took part in attacking civilians.
2. Returning all hostages as an act of good faith.

As for point 1, if they actually are against the targeting of civilians, then this should be a non-issue. If they are holding onto the idea that it somehow balances the scale of evils that Israel has committed, I think they're losing a lot of international support for this eye-for-an-eye exchange mentality, especially since some view their retaliation as more extreme than Israel's crimes. It also brings into question the morals of Hamas as a society. If I watch videos from that music festival, even if Israel is just as bad, I'd have to prioritize hating both rather than choosing a side.

As for point 2, I think Israel has shown clearly that hostage bargaining chips are not of high value. I think if they returned all hostages, they would score far more points with the international community than they would lose by whatever bargaining power they provide in dealing with Israel. I bet they could even trade 1:10 or greater for minors held by Israel and the international community would support them as much as if they had released them on good faith alone. I also think that without the rallying cry to bring home hostages, the Israeli government will be less unified in continuing the war.

Now, I don't think either of these would do much to approach a peace deal. This doesn't address the goals of either party that are keeping them in this war. But I think it would even out playing field a bit as far as international support goes."

Netanyahu spoke very plainly today that the main weapons smuggling routes wherein arms from around the world are brought into Gaza are through the tunnels underneath the Philadelphi corridor, the border between Gaza and Egypt. Netanyahu says the IDF must remain in place there to prevent perforations of this border that would allow Hamas to re-arm and ultimately launch more attacks at Israel. To those who don‚Äôt want Israel to maintain control of the corridor Netanyahu simply asks: what is the alternative? I‚Äôm open to other ideas, including the IDF being there, but what do you suggest in place of this to prevent the rearmament of Hamas? Israel has spent nearly a year in blood, treasure and lives to establish control of these zones and destroy tunnel networks. Many Israelis and Palestinians have died in the process, a horrific toll. Israel does not want to have to ever go back into Gaza and shed blood of either Israelis or Palestinians because Hamas has made a comeback. It would be an utter tragedy and catastrophe for the region if Hamas reconstitutes itself and retains control. So if you‚Äôre asking Israel to walk away after this, how do you guarantee it‚Äôs security? How do you prevent the Hamas Cancer from metastasizing again at the expense of anyone in the region who eventually wants peace or a ceasefire? Today he asked the world, and the world mostly twiddled it‚Äôs thumbs, said little and did even less. Again stressed the importance of a ‚Äúdeal‚Äù impotently and confusedly. But no one has any real suggestions. This indicates that they‚Äôre either out of ideas, recklessly stupid, or worse - they don‚Äôt care if Hamas re-arms. 

Can anyone in this community come up with a better idea than the IDF retaining control of the corridor to block weapons smuggling? If so, share it here, and then maybe also with Biden and Harris. "

Many of them [don't even know which river and which sea](https://nationalpost.com/news/world/israel-middle-east/many-u-s-students-who-chant-from-the-river-to-the-sea-dont-know-which-river-sea) they are chanting about, and when they find out, a significant number of them disavow that call.  But let's stop pretending that those who are building ""popular support for... armed struggle"" are *peace activists.*  At least the jihadist extremists of Within Our Lifetime have the honesty to openly acknowledge that they support violence against both Jews in Israel and Jews in the US.  

Do they have the right of free speech? I am not a lawyer, so whether what they are doing constitutes ""material support of terrorism"" is not a judgment I am qualified to make. Otherwise, as long as what they are doing complies with Columbia's time, place and manner restrictions, then they have the right to do this. That's really not what I'm focusing on. Rather, I'm highlighting the fact that **Columbia University Apartheid Divest openly supports Hamas**. So do many other groups in what I refer to as the Hamas Support Network. Let's just stop trying to pretend otherwise, OK? "
1f8z9qg,Britain suspending arms sales to Israel due to violations of international law in the war against Palestine,2024-09-04 17:30:15,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f8z9qg/britain_suspending_arms_sales_to_israel_due_to/,"I was surfing the web in a cyber cafe recently and came across news stating that the Brits are suspending arms sales to Israel: [https://english.almayadeen.net/news/politics/uk-suspends-30-of-350-arms-exports-licenses-to--israel](https://english.almayadeen.net/news/politics/uk-suspends-30-of-350-arms-exports-licenses-to--israel) 

Apparently 30 out of the 350 export licenses are being suspended because it ""violates international law"". This is pretty shocking news in the middle of a brutal war at a time when the Jews are trying to defend themselves in the trenches of Rafah and the hilltops of Judea Samaria. 



What international laws is Israel violating? IDF is the most moral army on earth. Will the Brits ever suspend any sales to Palestine or sanction Hamas?



The Brits are pretty useless, all they do is dip biscuits in tea and watch cricket that nobody understands (you buy a ticket to hit the wicket?). I see that there is a growing population of Islamists in the UK are the current Labour govt is trying to appease them. That's why for eg, London is such a mess with a Jihadist mayor running the show and all sorts of riots going on there. 



Anyway, thankfully, it seems that it won't make any difference because only 1% of all arms sales to Israel comes from the UK. Germany and the USA are the biggest suppliers and these two countries love the Jews, having learnt a lot from the Holocaust experience. 



Unfortunately, I see that others are making noise, the Norwegians seem to want to divest as well: https://www.commondreams.org/news/norway-divests-from-israel. What do the Norwegians think of themselves? That they are still vikings? Nevertheless, arms sales or not, the Jews will win the war and dominate Palestine!"

1f8sfvi,Leaked document shows Nethanyahu made major changes to US-backed hostage deal,2024-09-04 12:47:56,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f8sfvi/leaked_document_shows_nethanyahu_made_major/,"Link : https://www.timesofisrael.com/newly-revealed-document-shows-pm-made-large-changes-to-us-backed-hostage-deal-outline/

May 31st : Biden announced Israel's three-phase ceasefire proposal.

July 7th : Netanyahu presented Israel‚Äôs hostage negotiating team with a list of what he said were four nonnegotiable demands that must be met in order for Israel to move ahead with the US-backed proposal.

1. ‚ÄúAny deal will allow Israel to return to fighting until its war aims are achieved.‚Äù

2. ‚ÄúWeapons smuggling to Hamas from the Gaza-Egypt border will not be possible.‚Äù

3. ‚ÄúThe return of thousands of armed terrorists to the northern Gaza Strip will not be possible.‚Äù

4. ‚ÄúIsrael will maximize the number of living hostages who will be returned from Hamas captivity.‚Äù 
(Interesting choice of word)

Included among the demands was the stipulation that Israel must remain in control of the Philadelphi Corridor, which runs along the Gaza-Egypt border, as well as the Netzarim Corridor and the Rafah border crossing. According to Ynet, this was presented in the amended version, known as the ‚Äúclarification document‚Äù. 

The condition for IDF troops continue to control the Philadelphi Corridor seemed to be a sticking point that Hamas rejected, Nethanyahu continued to insist and other Israeli officials werent entirely convinced it was absolutely necessary. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant reportedly calling it an unnecessary constraint that we‚Äôve placed upon ourselves. Gallant had previously warned that Netanyahu‚Äôs stubborn insistence on the matter was running out the clock for the hostages who are still alive.

Leaked documents indicated that Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi and Almog Sarusi, four of the six hostages murdered by Hamas at the end of last week, had been slated for release during the first phase of this potential deal. 

An unnamed Israeli official was very critical of Netanyahu for making changes to the US-backed proposal, and accused him of intentionally sabotaging the deal. History will one day judge this document very harshly, the official said. He calls it the document of blood. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

It would seem from what has been leaked, there is no intention for Nethanyahu government to annex the entire Gaza Strip. According to the leaked document, unarmed Gazan civilians would be able to return back to Gaza, including North Gaza, which is where Gaza City is located. It would seem IDF have other plans for North Gaza or Gaza City, and will not accept any terrorist back to North Gaza. Previously, Israel mentioned needing a buffer zone, probably North Gaza would be a new buffer zone. 

The leaked document doesnt mention any forced transfer of population to Sinai, Egypt, Negev, West Bank, Ireland, Spain etc‚Ä¶ (which we heard as rumors). When Biden introduced the ceasefire plan, he mentioned  600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza each day.

It isnt a permanent ceasefire, IDF can ‚Äúreturn fighting until the war aims are achieved‚Äù. The other Israeli  officials probably just want Nethanyahu to take the deal, free the hostages, then,‚Ä¶ after all the hostages are released, restart the ‚Äúfighting until the war aims are achieved‚Äù, this time, without having to worry about any hostages. But what excuse could Israel use to restart the war ?

If Philadelphi corridor is the only point of disagreement, then, I would say ceasefire talks seems to have progressed alot. Then again, this is a just leaked document, who knows how many versions of ceasefire talks were there and the authenticity of this leaked document. As of today, these terms has yet to be agreed by both sides and there is still no ceasefire in Gaza. 

There is a big divide between Nethanyahu and other Israeli leaders on how to proceed in this war. I think Israel government knows the way to save ‚Äúmaximum number of living hostages‚Äù is only through a ceasefire deal. IDF cant do Special Ops to save all the remaining hostages which could risk getting more hostages killed, takes alot of time and very complex operation.

I don‚Äôt care for Netanyahu but he hit this nail on the head. After Hamas released its directive to murder hostages if Israeli troops close in, in what has to be the least surprising turn of events of all time, can we finally all agree these protests did nothing but seriously harm the remaining hostages? 

I mean honestly who could not see this coming? When you blame your own government for the slain hostages, protest them, show division, of course Hamas, whose only goal is to make Israel look worse & sow malcontent, would seize on this opportunity. I hate to be harsh but every single protestor, though morally correct in their stance on Netanyahu imo, is a complete moron.    

Let me know if you disagree with my stance but with Hamas‚Äôs statement I see it hard to see this in any other way. 


Edit: I was unaware the useful idiot comment was made by Netanyahu months prior to this incident. With this in mind I want to be clear he‚Äôs a jacksass, and the people had every right to protest , and were not in fact ‚Äúuseful idiots‚Äù prior to this recent incident. My original assessment that those protesting Israel in the wake of this incident were in fact ‚Äúidiots‚Äù remains unchanged but only in regards to specifically this situation

1f8pbj4,Will Pro-Israel democrats swing 2024?,2024-09-04 09:54:55,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f8pbj4/will_proisrael_democrats_swing_2024/,"The Republicans have long been trying to swing Jewish democrats to the republican party often with disappointing results, but there are some signs that republicans are right now investing heavily into this strategy, and maybe it could get Trump over the finishing line in 2024. 

**Right Wing Media is amplifying Anti-Semitic content**

Elon Musks X is clearly amplifying anti-Semitic and targeting it towards Jewish users. If the algorithm suspects a user is Jewish, it will suggest content from Candace Owens, Nick Fuentes, or pro Hamas content from the likes of Megatron, Censored man, as well as progressive anti-Israel voices, creating both a climate of fear among American Jews and a sense that the democrats are anti-Israel. Established right wing media also amplified their coverage of anti-Israel protests before the summer to reach the older demographic. While this could just be a form a trigger content for business reasons, there might be political implications. 

**Democrats are concerned about Jewish voters**

Progressive influencers like Mehdi Hasan have warned the democrats about the risks of losing young voters countrywide and Muslim voters in Michigan, but democrat insiders seem more concerned about losing Jewish voters. Kamala ditched the idea of an arms embargo on Israel, and did not platform any Palestinians at the DNC. In the Project Veritas undercover video with National security advisor Sterlin Waters a while back, he also seemed to indicate that the democrats could not embrace a more anti-Israel platform because concerns about Jewish voters. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj1rurBNSZM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj1rurBNSZM)

Progressives tend to subscribe to a world view which rationalises any support for Israel as a result of corruption rather than political strategy.  Likely because on paper the Jewish population is not that significant in numbers, and evangelicals don't vote democrat anyway, so they attribute any support for Israel to AIPAC, donors or the deep state. However, they are only accounting for the approximate Jewish population, and not the ""extended"" Jewish population. 

Since American Jews are quite assimilated, there are a lot of Americans that don't identify as Jewish, but have a connection with Jews through their family. Kamala Harris and Trump both fall into this category, not Jewish but with Jewish spouse, Jewish daughter and son-in-law. Combined this is a much larger group of people. Conventional wisdom might suggest that people who are less connected with the Jewish community are also less concerned about Israel, but my experience is the opposite. People who are part of the Jewish extension are often more pro-Israel because they have limited interest in other aspects of Jewish life.

**Trump is moving away from the Far Right**

This could mainly be attributed to Trump seeking support among independents and centrists democrats, but also a strategy to remove some of the baggage which Jewish democrats would find objectionable with Trump. 

The question is whether this strategy will work in the swing states, or if Kamala will be able to discard both Jewish and Arab support and win solely on energized African Americans and loyal democrats. Since the republican machine  seems to spend so much effort on this strategy, it might prove successful. Democrats also have a hard time to respond to it, since if they try to out-Israel republicans they risk alienating more of their progressive base, so they have limited options.

The most ironic aspect of this is that in the end of the day, if this strategy is working, the anti-Israel progressives are playing right into Donald Trumps hand. "
1f8njsa,Using the civilian casualty ratio in the war as ‚Äúproof‚Äù Israel is committing genocide is a bad argument ,2024-09-04 07:47:27,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f8njsa/using_the_civilian_casualty_ratio_in_the_war_as/,"So far most sources agree that based on the available information the civilian casualty ratio
in Gaza is probably 50-70% (roughly 1:1-1:2). In contrast, on October 7th Hamas killed The 796 civilians, 379 members of the security forces and 14 civilian hostages, giving a total of 1,189 in one day. 

Let‚Äôs assume Israel completely removed all its defence measures for some reason or they failed. If they continued killing at similar rate since the beginning of the conflict the civilian death toll in Israel would be 800x333 days=266,400. 

In contrast, so far Israel has killed around 40,000 people on Gaza. If we assume 60% of these are civilians that‚Äôs 24,000 people in almost a year. Israel has one of the strongest militaries‚Äô in the world and could definitely inflict more damage.

Israel also warns civilians to evacuate an area before they strike, waited weeks before beginning the land invasion, tries to evacuate civilians from conflict areas, and has even been providing Palestinians in Gaza with polio vaccines. Like any nation, they are not perfect but these are the not actions of a group who wishes to exterminate Palestinians, which is the definition of genocide. The Israel-Palestine conflict has one of the lost number of deaths in the region compared to the Iran-Iraq war which led to 1-2million deaths. 

Here are some other number of civilian to combatant deaths:

### **Estimated Civilian-to-Combatant Casualty Ratios in Urban Warfare Conflicts**

1. **Gaza Conflicts (Various Operations: 2008-2023)**
   - **Operation Cast Lead (2008-2009):** Estimates suggest approximately 1,400-1,500 Palestinians were killed, with around 55-60% reported as civilians.
   - **Operation Protective Edge (2014):** Of the over 2,100 Palestinian casualties, estimates range from 50-70% civilians, depending on the source.
   - **Overall Ratio (2008-2023):** Roughly 1:1 to 3:2 (civilian to combatant), with significant variance depending on the specific operation and source of data.

2. **Battle of Mosul (Iraq, 2016-2017)**
   - **Casualties:** Approximately 9,000-11,000 civilians killed, with combatant casualties (ISIS fighters) estimated at around 2,000-4,000.
   - **Estimated Ratio:** Roughly 3:1 to 5:1 (civilian to combatant).

3. **Battle of Aleppo (Syria, 2012-2016)**
   - **Casualties:** Tens of thousands of civilians and combatants killed; estimates are imprecise, but some reports suggest a high civilian toll relative to combatants.
   - **Estimated Ratio:** Difficult to provide a precise number due to chaotic reporting, but potentially 2:1 to 4:1 (civilian to combatant).

4. **Battle of Raqqa (Syria, 2017)**
   - **Casualties:** Estimates of civilian deaths range from 1,600 to over 3,000; combatant casualties (ISIS fighters) were also significant.
   - **Estimated Ratio:** Roughly 1:1 to 2:1 (civilian to combatant), depending on sources.

5. **Battle of Fallujah (Iraq, 2004)**
   - **Casualties:** Estimates suggest hundreds to over a thousand civilian deaths, with around 1,200 insurgent fighters killed.
   - **Estimated Ratio:** Approximately 1:1 (civilian to combatant), though estimates vary.

6. **Siege of Sarajevo (Bosnia, 1992-1996)**
   - **Casualties:** Around 5,400 civilians killed during the siege; total casualties (including combatants) were higher.
   - **Estimated Ratio:** Around 2:1 (civilian to combatant), considering total casualties over the prolonged siege period.

7. **Grozny (First and Second Chechen Wars, 1994-1995 and 1999-2000)**
   - **Casualties:** Civilian deaths were in the tens of thousands; combatant casualties (both Russian forces and Chechen fighters) were also significant.
   - **Estimated Ratio:** Roughly 3:1 to 4:1 (civilian to combatant), particularly in the First Chechen War.

8. **Battle of Manila (Philippines, 1945)**
   - **Casualties:** Approximately 100,000 civilians killed in a month-long battle; Japanese and Allied military casualties combined were significantly lower.
   - **Estimated Ratio:** Around 10:1 or higher (civilian to combatant), due to intense urban combat and deliberate targeting of civilians.

9. **Siege of Leningrad (Soviet Union, 1941-1944)**
   - **Casualties:** An estimated 1 million civilians died, primarily from starvation, cold, and bombardment; combatant casualties were also significant but not as high.
   - **Estimated Ratio:** Around 10:1 (civilian to combatant), considering the prolonged nature and conditions of the siege.

10. **Battle of Berlin (Germany, 1945)**
    - **Casualties:** Estimates of civilian deaths vary but could be between 20,000 to 50,000; combatant casualties (German and Soviet) were significantly higher.
    - **Estimated Ratio:** Approximately 1:3 to 1:4 (civilian to combatant), given the intensity and scale of the battle.

So what is the threshold for a genocide according to activists ?"
1f8mbi2,Ongoing land seizures - BBC investigation,2024-09-04 06:17:39,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f8mbi2/ongoing_land_seizures_bbc_investigation/,"Amidst the intense and painful conflict that's currently happening, I believe it‚Äôs crucial to address a related issue that has been simmering for years‚Äîthe ongoing and rapid seizure of land in the West Bank. BBC investigations have highlighted that new settler outposts are appearing at an alarming rate, often linked to the displacement and harassment of Palestinian communities.

No matter where your stance lies politically, these are the facts on the ground. The question we must all ask ourselves is: What happens if this continues unchecked? Imagine a century from now‚Äîwill there be any land left for Palestinians, or will it be entirely swallowed up by these settlements?

This isn‚Äôt just a question of politics but one of long-term sustainability and justice. Whether you support or oppose the settlements, you cannot ignore the trajectory this is taking and what it means for the future of both Israelis and Palestinians.

I‚Äôm reaching out to hear your thoughts. How do you feel about the ongoing land seizures, and what do you think the future holds if this trend continues? 

Also, we have been seeing videos of settlers harassing locals for decades. Isn't it clear first of all, that it's a state policy at this point and secondly it is a grave crime and one of the reasons Hamas exists in the first place.

1f8gbab,Zionist talking points,2024-09-04 00:53:39,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f8gbab/zionist_talking_points/,"Let me preface this - [zionism is a 19th century ideology, I am only criticizing said ideology](https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/resource/zionism/). Whether it's a Jewish, Christian, Hindu or Atheist, zionists arguments usually seem to come from one or more these places:

EDIT: for those who don't understand subtext, I'm not saying zionists don't say these words verbatim, I'm saying their arguments stem from that logic

""Israel is a Jewish ethnostate, so any criticism or attack of the states or certain civilians ideologies or actions is an attack on Jews"" 

""Israel is not being attacked because it commits war crimes, it is because of antisemetism""

""Israel represents all Jewish people everywhere""

""Jews who don't accept zionism are uneducated/sellouts/""self-hating"" ""

""The Holy Book says Jewish people will return,  governments are allowed to make that happen by force""

""Jewish people can commit genocide, because they have been through genocide""

""Don't listen to Palestinians/Arabs""

""Don't listen to Muslims""

""Palestinians today should be persecuted for their ancestors actions""

""Palestinians are responsible for the effects of Europe's antisemetism""

""Palestinians are responsible for Britain's colonization"" 

""Palestinians are responsible for my ancestors pain""

""I deserve revenge for my ancestors pain"" 

They tend to be coupled with a subjective ignorance to the actual devastation caused by israel. Bombs are just numbers, bodies are numbers, children amputees are numbers. It seems like if zionists aren't brushing off the tens of thousands of murders caused by israel, they are applauding them amongst each other. I don't think anyone should deny all the past antisemetism in the world, but I also don't think they should use antisemetism to justify what has been proven over and over again to be crimes against humanity. Islam, Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism, literally every other religion has been weaponized for harm, division, and colonization, but zionists can't seem to accept the idea that Judaism is being weaponized in this instance. All the anti-zionist Jews out there, all the Jews displaced or dead because of Israel (like my friend's family), they should not be ignored.

1f826j5,Why so many pro israeli people justify the occupation?,2024-09-03 15:03:21,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f826j5/why_so_many_pro_israeli_people_justify_the/,"I ask this question in all honesty, because I truly believe that this is a central point of the conflict. Many Israelis ‚Äì and also many people who align themselves with the State of Israel and its policies ‚Äì even among those who have not supported Netanyahu‚Äôs extremist government over the past decades, justify or minimize the negative impact of the Israeli military occupation of the Palestinian territories and its harmful effects on the civilian population.

The truth is that after the 1967 war - which was not against the Palestinians, but against other States - thousands of Palestinians live under a military State, subject to a foreign authority that exercises its power in an authoritarian and arbitrary manner, implanting a colonial population in illegal settlements protected by the military and exercising daily violence against the oppressed population.

You don't have to be a genius to understand that the occupation of the Palestinian territories will ALWAYS generate violence on the part of those who suffer it.

You don't have to be very intelligent to understand that since the Palestinian national identity is a unit, a policy of divide and conquer, like the one that has sought to divide Gaza from the West Bank and both from East Jerusalem, is of no use. The Palestinian territories are a national unit, they cannot be divided.

So how and why do they justify the occupation? And then what do they really expect the Palestinians to do, if the State of Israel has NEVER recognized the right of the Palestinians to a State? Neither in Oslo, Madrid or Camp David is this right recognised. Do they want to expel them all and eliminate them as a people?

**1) Non-violent Protests and Demonstrations**

Some of the most common non-violent Palestinian resistance actions media are protests and demonstrations. These happen almost on a weekly basis both in the West Bank and Gaza. Sadly, most not only end up in failure, injuries or deaths but you won't normally hear this in the media. Some examples,

March 30th, 1976: Thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank and Arab Israeli citizens of Israel take part in strikes and nonviolent demonstrations in response to the Israeli government‚Äôs plan to expropriate 60,000 dunams of Palestinian-owned land in the Galilee. Six protestors were killed as a result of Israeli gun fire. To commemorate this incident, Palestinians observe Land Day every year as a day for action and protest.

[https://www.jpost.com/features/in-thespotlight/this-week-in-history-the-1976-land-day-protests](https://www.jpost.com/features/in-thespotlight/this-week-in-history-the-1976-land-day-protests)

17 October 2010, in the Palestinian village of Budrus, villagers held 55 peaceful demonstrations over 10 months in defiance of the Israeli expansion of settlements and the the West Bank barrier headed by the Palestinian non-violent advocate, Issa Amro

[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-11555031](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-11555031)

October 25th, 2022. Hundreds of people took to the streets early this morning in several cities to protest the Israeli military assault on the northern West Bank city of Nablus that left four Palestinians dead and 21 injured, including four critical, and calls were made for a general strike today in Nablus.

[https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/131505](https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/131505)

Of course, this only barely scratches the surface of the tons of peaceful non-violent demonstrations held every year in the West Bank. Banners, demonstrations, protests, against settlement expansion and against the barrier that separates Palestinian West Bank communities with each other all are daily occurences but sadly the media and the world either ignores or rarely takes heed of these event. It's not hard to see why. Demonstrations aren't that flashy enough to attract attention and grab the media's focus but I think that's precisely what makes these acts of non-violent resistance unique. They aren't going to attract the world's attention, they aren't going to be the headline in a CNN or Fox News article, they aren't going to be the thing that galvanizes international support around the world.

Yet despite all this (plus the almost non-effectiveness) of such actions, some Palestinians still hold firm and committed to these acts of non-violence in the name of peace and reconciliation. There's more to be said here, but I'll continue down below. Non-violent demonstrations and protests are just one, out of a dozen ways Palestinians have used to peacefully resist.

**2) Tax Strikes.**

In 1989, during the First Intifada, the Palestinian resistance (Unified National Leadership of the Uprising, UNLU) and¬†Ghassan Andoni¬†and¬†Kamel Danoun, urged people to stop paying taxes to Israel, which inherited and modified the¬†previous Jordanian¬†tax-collection regime in the¬†West Bank.¬†**""No taxation without representation,""** said a statement from the organizers. The people of Beit Sahour responded to this call with an organized citywide¬†[tax strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_resistance)¬†that included refusal to pay and file tax returns.

The quoted slogan is reminiscent of the American resistance to British imperialism and defiance against oppressive British tax policies. I think the notion of taxation WITH representation should be a notion and ideal close to many people around the world, especially to those in America and the Western liberal democratic world.

Tax resistance, or the refusal to pay¬†tax¬†because of opposition to the government that is imposing the tax, or to government policy, or as¬†opposition to taxation in itself has been commonly used around the world as a form of peaceful resistance and opposition to oppressive policies. It's not something unique and rare around the world. The adoption of this by the Palestinians of Beit Sahour marks another example of how people can peacefully resist against oppression and tyranny through non-violent means to achieve peace and justice

**3) The ""White Intifada"" of 2010**

In 2010, A ""White Intifada"" took hold in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Activities included weekly peaceful protests by Palestinian activists accompanied by Israeli human rights organization¬†B'Tselem¬†and Israeli academics and students against settlers and security forces. The EU, through its foreign policy chief¬†Catherine Ashton¬†has criticised Israel for convicting an organiser of the peaceful movement.

While the term ""Intifada"" usually has negative connotations in Israeli society, that doesn't always have to be the case. Intifada literally means to a rebellion, uprising, revolt, or resistance. It is not that is by itself, violent or bloody. There are certainly many ways revolts and uprising have been bloodless and peaceful all throughout history. So many examples to choose from the Americas to Europe and the Middle East. The ""White Intifada"" or mass protests and demonstrations against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank is no different. A large group of people non-violently demonstrating against oppression, united in solidarity and common ideals is exactly what a well-led organized non-violent form of resistance should look like. Sadly, most people don't know about this chapter in the history of Palestinian resistance, and it is often overshadowed by the First and Second Intifadas, which were far more violent and bloody. Like I said before, non-violent acts of resistance aren't flashy and don't always get the world's and the media's attention.

**4) Non-violent Palestinian NGOs and Movement Groups:**

**The¬†Bil'in Popular Committee against the Wall,**

A Palestinian organization that advocates non-violent means of resistance by demonstrating against the Israeli barrier and continued settlement construction. The protests take the form of marches from the village to the site of the wall with the aim of halting construction and dismantling already constructed portions.¬†Headed by Iyad Burnat (see further below)

One more thing I'd like to add, when Gandhi was peacefully demonstrating against the British occupation over India, he was tried and sentenced to prison for ""inciting sedition"" just like how all these ""Palestinian Gandhis"" were arrested and detained by Israel. Some pro-Israelis might look at all these arrests as justified for breaking the law, yet do you say the same thing about Gandhi's arrest? Were the British in the right to arrest Gandhi for disturbing the order and inciting sedition against the ruling British class? Was Gandhi in the wrong for trying to peacefully fight back and liberate his homeland from British rule?

**In summary:** Here are just a few examples of Palestinian non-violent resistance that have been tried in the past and continue to be enacted even in the present day. While the media and most people focus on Hamas and the PIJ, this ignores the wider context in which Palestinians have also tried non-violent means to resist occupation.

This isn't even getting into legitimate forms of resistance such as targeting IDF military targets and military vehicles. Stone-throwing against IDF soldiers or slapping IDF soldiers is not illegal. According to the charter for human rights and international law, occupied people have the right to resist even with armed methods, as long as it conforms to the law and international standard.

My goal is to only show a few such examples of Palestinian non-violent resistance actions, both for those who never knew about them and for those that falsely accuse the Palestinians of never trying peaceful non-violent means. At the very least, I hope this post inspires people to go out and search for themselves what the Palestinians have gone through and what they have done to confront it.

Lastly, I have a question for pro-Israeli supporters out there. Many of them rightfully critique and condemn Palestinians when they stab or shoot innocent Israeli civilians, yet here we have examples of those who pursued a more peaceful path. Any number of them could've have joined Hamas, launched suicide bombings, or stab civilians. Yet they chose a different path. Despite that, Israel continues to detain and incarcerate them under administrative detention where abuse and violence is rife.

Question: If you were a Palestinian, what would you have done? How would you peacefully resist in such a way that doesn't get you arrested by Israel? All of the above I mentioned have and continue to be arrested and detained by Israel. **How would you have done so without getting into trouble??**

Second, if you saw your peaceful non-violent means led to little or nothing at all, would you still keep to them or try a different method? If yes, how would you propose to do so without being called a terrorist? When Palestinians stab an IDF soldier, a legitimate military target under the LOAC, they are called violent terrorists. **If you were to choose the path of legitimate armed resistance, how would you do so without being called a terrorist, but as a freedom fighter?** As the saying goes, ""One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter"".

For as long as I have observed this conflict and those involved from both sides of the conflict, no matter what the Palestinians do, they will always get labeled as ""terrorists"". Shooting and stabbing an IDF soldier in the West Bank? That's terrorism. Throwing rocks against IDF soldiers and IDF military vehicles (all perfectly legitimate military targets under the LOAC), that's terrorism. Peacefully organizing a non-violent demonstration against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank? That's terrorism? Pro-Israelis condemn and get mad when Palestinians shoot and stab innocent Israeli civilians. When Palestinians change their targets and attack legitimate IDF military soldiers, you call that ""terrorism"". **You want the Palestinians to peacefully non-violently resist. When they do that, you accuse them of breaking the law. You want the Palestinians to only attack legitimate military targets. When they do as you say, you call them ""terrorists"".**

**TLDR:** So what do you want the Palestinians to do??? To pro-Israelis, show me a way that isn't ""terrorism"" by your definition and doesn't get you arrested or in trouble with Israel. No matter what the Palestinians try, it seems to be all wrong according to your perspective. If you're really anti-occupation and believe in the LOAC, suggest a way for the Palestinians to peacefully non-violent resist against occupation that isn't wrong by your standards."
1f7uk7f,Should America Distance itself from Israel politically?,2024-09-03 08:11:52,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f7uk7f/should_america_distance_itself_from_israel/,"This question is a genuine attempt at a discussion and I personally can‚Äôt decide on the best choice. Hear me out. Personally, I sympathize with both Palestinians and Israelis. I think both have legitimate plight and complaints against the opposing side. I think there should be a ceasefire NOW. I think Netanyahu, Smoltrich, and Ben-Givr are far-right criminals who belong in jail. I think Hamas are irredeemable terrorists whose upper leadership should be hunted down and imprisoned or killed for as long as it takes. But both sides are deeply dug in and hard headed. Naturally, both sides are interested in their own interests and that of their people.

This leads me to the topic of our discussion, as an American, as an agnostic, I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs in America‚Äôs interest to continue to get involved with the middle-east and staunchly back Israel. I think one can make a good argument that most of America‚Äôs issues in that region stem from our historic and staunch backing of Israel regardless how reckless it behaves. I also believe Israel is now a very rich and powerful country able to stand on its own even if it is outnumbered. 

I‚Äôm torn as a tax paying American with no direct link to Israel by heritage or religion. On one hand, I appreciate it is a country of fellow westerners (ideologically) and they are the only genuine democracy in the region. Therefore, we should help them. On the other hand, our support for Israel is the cause of a lot of our geopolitical headaches and I‚Äôm not sure what in hard tangible benefits America gets in return? 

Should America continue defending, at substantial cost, an island of western democracy? Or should America, cut off our close ties, stop blocking every UN resolution, stop giving an annual military stipend  and turn its focus to Asia and out of the Middle East? I don‚Äôt have any ill motivation against Israel or Palestine. Frankly, if I had to decide, I‚Äôd likely throw in with Israel. But I have confidence in their ability as a strong nuclear power to handle their own business. On the cynical side, Israel and Palestine can fight each other for as long as they want and it‚Äôs no longer America‚Äôs headache. A bonus for America since it‚Äôs obviously biased toward Israel, is that Israel will likely be able to continue to dominate the region but we no longer have will have to listen to Hamasniks whine to American leaders anymore. Our hands will be finally clean and technically impartial geopolitically.

We have seen it on CNN, ABC News, and now another one on BBC showcasing Judea Samaria, I would recommend people to take a look at it and see how they present it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLDYkX7l9A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLDYkX7l9A) 



The tropes are very clear, the Jews here somehow are the evil thieves burning down fields, settling the hilltops and building outposts, burning olive trees while the Palestinians are completely innocent. Some Jewish peace activists go to visit the farmers of Palestine whose crops have been burnt down and it shows ""Even after losing his home and his crops, Nabil offered the camera crew and peace activists oranges"". Unfortunately, these views are permeating in the Western audience which is constantly receiving negative views of Israel and builds up to situations like the UK govt starts to cut some arms exports.



Ok, but where in the documentary does it show the Jenin, Tulkarem and Nablus brigades planting IEDs on IDF jeeps coming there to clean up the mess PA has left behind. Where does it show the attacks on the police car which had the commander of the Etzion brigade? This documentary is a deliberate anti-semitic slander to make the Jews look bad and evil.



I really admire the Jews who are moving to their Holy Land. They are showing a lot of resilience in the middle of the war, saying ""We are here to stay, we will build and thrive, Palestinians can instead leave"". When so many Jews yesterday were out in the streets protesting the govt aiming to ""shut down the economy"", these Jews in Judea Samaria are doing hard work to defend worldwide Jewry."
1f7qn9z,What's the Logic (If Any) Behind the War?,2024-09-03 03:56:35,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f7qn9z/whats_the_logic_if_any_behind_the_war/,"Maybe this should be in the r/explainitlikeim5 sub, but the longer this conflict drags on, the more confused I get.

For context - I think that the long-term conflict is intentionally supported by both sides:  both want foreign aid for their leaders' own personal financial gain and so keeping the groups living next to each other, ready to violently attack is good for business.  

That's the cynical realist in me.

But my question: in the SHORTER term conflict, what is the goal?  

This isn't a baited question: I had similar confusion about the US involvement in Afghanistan after we found Bin Laden...in Pakistan.  Didn't know what we were doing in Afghanistan for the years thereafter, aside from setting money on fire and pissing off a bunch of Afghanis (and stepping on the same rake the Russians did prior to our involvement).

But for Bibi (spoiler alert:  not a fan.  At All.), he's waging war on the civilians as well as Hamas in Palestine, which means civilian deaths are a known part of the equation.  The likelihood of the hostages being killed as part of an IDF strike is EXTREMELY high.

So the endgame is...what?  It can't be to ""obliterate Hamas,"" because they're ""making"" more Hamas every time they kill a non-combatant (for all of his faults, McChrystal's Counterinsurgency Math is logically sound).  It can't be to ""save the hostages"" because it seems like that's damned near impossible at this point: the IDF has saved 8 out of the 145 suspected remaining in Gaza.

What's the company line from the Israeli government on ""winning"" in this conflict?"

1f7k9c4,Israel should install a pro-West puppet government into Gaza,2024-09-02 22:44:17,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f7k9c4/israel_should_install_a_prowest_puppet_government/,"I'm not using ""puppet"" as a derogatory term.

Throughout history, usually when one country defeats another country in war and occupies it, it enters into a tacit social contract:
 - The losing country temporarily or permanently gives up its right to express dissent and oppose the victor and becomes a supporter of it's former enemy
 - The winning country gives the losing country's puppet regime economic and political recognition and builds economic and cultural relations
 - Both the US and even authoritarian governments have generally practiced this contract

Israel, so far, has utterly failed in that. 

If we really want to defeat Hamas, consolidating territory thats already under control and creating a pro-Israeli palestinian state in Gaza, defacto controlled by Israel/Mossad, is the only way to ensure stability. Too much talk about destroying Hamas and no talk about how to govern Gaza after the war. The fact that this still isn't the case is honestly ridiculous.

In any normal world, once a country comes under your occupation, it becomes your ally overnight.

I'd like to offer my idea and get your thoughts on it. I'm sure it's very flawed, so feel free to absolutely shred it.

The plan:

The Palestinian Republic of Gaza (PRG)

This will be the government that will be created by Israel to govern northern Gaza and any other area under Israel's control (hopefully the entirety of Gaza). While Israel gets the final say over what happens, it'll still have a council, cabinet, and legislature consisting of Palestinians who wish to collaborate with Israeli security forces. These official government seats will be filled with liberated politicians imprisoned by Hamas, Gazan/West Bank moderates and Arab Israelis. It'll officially recognize Israel as sovereign country and security partner, and also claim to be the sole legitimate government of Gaza. It'll also brand itself as the final protector of Palestine and Gaza by extracting economic and political concessions from Israel like getting economic aid and trade agreements. Israel will recognize the PRG, establish strong economic ties, promote the PRG's international recognition. The PRG will also formally request Israel to defend it from the Hamas terror threat.

In collaboration with and under control of the IDF, the PRG will have a security force that will firmly regulate the press and speech to root out any pro-Hamas and radical anti-Israeli sentiment, using the war as justification. Censor pro-liberation sentiment and begin a propoganda campaign very similar to what the US did during its post-war occupation of Japan after 1945 to root out lingering militaristic and nationalist sympathies.

It'll rebuild its urban areas and then accept refugees slowly and cautiously in areas still occupied by Hamas.

The inspiration here is the US's work in Japan after WWII, South Korea, and West Germany.

Here are past failed puppet states and how we would prevent the PRG from having the same fate:

- South Vietnam: This happened because the US decided to stop supporting it in the 1970s when North Vietnam broke the ceasefire of 1973. Israel would need to spend at least 15 years supporting, protecting and propping up the PRG before it's developed enough for the people to see it as a legitimate country worth defending.

- Afghanistan: Basically a gross lack of monetary and economic support from the US, plus a lot of contested territory with soft boundaries. The PRG would need a lot of financial support in its first 10 years and eventually have a standing army.

Let me know what you think. I hope we can at least agree that it's better than what is happening now."
1f7j1zd,Respectfully... Pro-Palestinians and Pro-Israelis are dumb,2024-09-02 21:51:51,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f7j1zd/respectfully_propalestinians_and_proisraelis_are/,"I've just found this sub and thought ""Oh nice, a place people can talk about this terrible issue"" and what I see is Pro-Palestinians supporting Hamas' killing people while Pro-Israelis also acting the same and in the end saying Jihads are the problem but not the Zionists.

I'll make both sides angry on this posts because it is actually infuriating to read through posts here, especially ones from Americans who got all their information from either Reddit or their neighbor Sally who saw something on Facebook.

Fact: Hamas is both a freedom fighter group and a terrorist group. They are not the first group to rise up against something unjust only to become as evil as people they are rising up to. It's stupid to think of them as either freedom fighters or terrorists, Hamas mostly consists of people who were effected by Israels attacks on the Arab populace since 1948. Hamas was founded as an answer to Zionists hold over their rightful land that is still going on today.

I've seen people say ""Maybe Hamas should stop hiding under schools and hospitals if you don't want Palestinians to get hurt."" I don't know if I have to say something about this because it sounds psychotic even when you read it. Do you people really think Israel only shot those schools and hospitals because Hamas was hiding there? Death toll reached 40.000 Palestinians, how many do you think were actually Hamas... In December of last year it was reported that Israel has already killed more press personnel than that died in WW2, think about that. Israel either doesn't care who they are bombing or they are specifically bombing civilians and press personnel to weed out the populace so they aren't as much as a problem they are now in the future, and to silence the press of course. Weeding out the populace might seem like an insane idea to Israel supporters but scaring young generations to make them more obedient is a legit tactic used by IDF, it has been documented multiple times that IDF uses night raids on innocent civilians to create unrest, make the young populace scared and also train their recruits [Israeli army night raids spread fear in West Bank | Human Rights | Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2015/8/15/israeli-army-night-raids-spread-fear-in-west-bank).

Fact: Zionism is bad, and people who say it aren't anti-semi, It's equivalent of saying Sharia law is bad. Both of them are about nations built around a religion and they are the worst part of them. Zionism is an idea of a Jewish country, with only it's own people. When you consider that you have to be born Jewish to be... Jewish and Israel is founded on lands where other people already were living you can see how that's going to be bad. And you can tell how bad it is when you add the fact about how Ethiopian Jews faced and still faces racism in Israel despite being Jewish [The plight of Ethiopian Jews in Israel - BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32813056). It's clear that Israel's dream is having only white Jewish people, I've seen some people say ""Israelis are not even white they are obviously arab"" in this sub and I'm guessing they don't know that England located ancestors of current day residents to that land from Europe...

There are also people saying how Hamas started a genocide with their October 7th... This is again probably ramblings of Americans who equate October 7th to 9/11. This whole fight has been going on since before 2023 or 1948. It's too long to explain since it began around 1880s, so I'll just leave the ""main"" start point of Israel's rule, [Nakba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba) which also goes in detail to prior to 1948. 



TLDR: Hamas has rightful reasons but is still a terrorist organization and it's evil rivals IDF. Hamas hiding and not hiding in places used by public doesn't give Israel the right to bomb kids. Zionism kicks out any other religion or race that isn't white and Jewish, and since Israel was founded upon a already existing country it creates more problems, it also isn't anti-semitic to say it's bad, zionism has nothing to do with religion also even though Israel is self-proclaimed homeland of the Jews, Just as ISIS does not represent Muslims, Israel does not represent Jews either. This fight is not a new thing, Palestinians have been getting killed and mistreated for decades.

  
Last note: I did say it was going to be make a lot of people mad. The end point is that there is no way of getting rid of a country full of people, this goes for both Israel and Palestine, no matter if one of them has no right to exist depending on which ""side"" you are on. Only thing we as a collective can hope for is peace for both nations, free of restrictions, free of checkpoints or contrabands. It's obvious that Israel is using too much force upon Palestine and even if you don't think so, it's clear that people are sick of it and only way for peace is to separate both states. I'd like to think we all want the good for both nations, no matter what their ancestors or their leaders, soldiers did."

1f7cmhv,Killing Hamas Leaders,2024-09-02 17:31:59,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f7cmhv/killing_hamas_leaders/,"Has Israel and its allies prioritized the killing and arrest of the leaders of their most wanted terror group throughout this war?

In the usual war against terror, the leaders of terror groups are usually an important target. From Al Qaeda to ISIS, the west celebrated the killing of terror group leaders as a priority and crown achievement in the fight, often announcing it as the beginning of end of the group. 

But in the case of Hamas since October 7, I have seen little evidence that Israel and its friends see killing Haniyeh, Sinwar, etc as top targets whose deaths mean much. I am extremely pro Palestinian and despite my sympathies with its resistance, I see that October 7 was horrible and the leaders who planned and implemented such event deserve death as do leaders of all such terror groups. 

Haniyeh was eventually killed but very late into the war. Instead, he flew from Turkey to Qatar (western friends) and elsewhere under the watchful eyes of the west. What other Islamist terror group leader does the west allow to live so openly happily. Perhaps they didn‚Äôt actually believe Hamas was a satanic terror group as they claimed? 

Sinwar remains alive in Gaza while Israel kills low level fighters and an uncountable number of civilians by the day. This tweet by Richard Goldberg (whom I despise) seems to me the kind of behavior I would expect from the west if they thought Hamas was truly the epitome of evil. But none of this has happened. https://x.com/rich_goldberg/status/1830341552427712761?s=46&t=gkDbQduilaQxzlRVGORsdA

Why has this war against terror been different from others? Was Haniyeh and now Sinwar simply too difficult to kill or is there a different understanding of the nature of terror being fought here? "
1f7cbhy,Netanyahoo and the Hannibal directive. ,2024-09-02 17:19:33,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f7cbhy/netanyahoo_and_the_hannibal_directive/,What do people not understand about netanyahoo. He would rather have the Israeli captives dead than alive. And it's showing to the world. He won't allow a ceasefire because he says it will be giving in to Hamas.. the zionists policy in Palestine is to rid the inhabitants of Palestine to take the land. Israel has already proven that they will kill soldiers and civilians of Israel to prevent the headache of the people of Israel screaming to get their people back alive. It is counter to the policy of eradication of the unarmed population to have a ceasefire. There is nothing stopping these genocidal racist illegal occupiers. Not even the will of the people of Israel. The right wing government of Israel sees the people of Palestine as subhuman animals. Which there is more dignity in one Palestinians big toe than in any of these zionist. They are dragging the West into their shitshow and it's costing billions and billions of dollars and innocent lives on both sides of the battle. If it weren't for these racist leaders the world would be a much better place. They act as if they are a victim when they are the agressor. For decades. The country of Israel is a powderkeg and the racist murderous leaders of Israel are fully to blame for all of it. They have broken parts with the United nations many times to continue the displacement of Palestinians and to steal their land. They have manipulated the media and the US government to the point of they control what we do. The US govt. And that is participating in the genocide of an unarmed population. But we have homeless people being jailed for being homeless. It seems the more you lie and the more you cheat and kill the better off you are in this world. Never give in to the lies and become complacent in the injustices committed in the name of democracy. These people are dirty tricksters and will do what they need to do to continue their criminal genocidal policies. There have been multiple times that Israel has agreed to stop the killings and theft of land only to continue the zionists policy of land theft. These people are not the defenders of democracy in the middle east these people are religious fanatics who kill and resort to treacherous activity to achieve their goals and will not stop.

1f7bui4,What does our enemy want? Nothing we can accept.,2024-09-02 17:01:03,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f7bui4/what_does_our_enemy_want_nothing_we_can_accept/,"We are facing a totalizing ideology, known as Palestinianism, executed by Hamas and its enablers, that wants nothing less than ending the absolutely humiliating specter of sovereign Jews. We are facing an enemy dedicated by all means necessary to teaching a final lesson to those Jews who dared imagine themselves equal, sovereign, and masters of their fate in their own state on their ancestral land, so that they never attempt to do so ever again. 

We are facing an enemy that no only invaded our country, our homes, to gleefully murder and mutilated the most peace loving people in their beds, but went on to kidnap hundreds of them to serve as an insurance that they will pay no consequences for what they did on October 7th. The brutal executors of the ideology of Palestinianism, known as Hamas, did not kidnap people for the limited goal of releasing murderers from Israeli jails, but rather to ensure it pays no price for what it did and therefore could do it again, and again, and again. 

Make no mistake, as far as Hamas is concerned, it paid no price and suffered no consequences for October 7th. The devastation in Gaza, the people killed, are all meaningless to Hamas. Buoyed by the global pressure to provide it with ongoing supplies it even as it is conducting a total war, it remains in firm control of Gaza and its people. It secured a position as a legitimate negotiating partner while all the pressure is placed on Israel to yield to its demands to go back to October 6th with no consequences for its actions. Nothing is done against the backers of Hamas - Qatar, Egypt and Iran - pretending that the first two are somehow helpful (they're not), and the latter somehow uninvolved.  

Once Hamas exchanged the women and children it kidnapped, who were above all a liability for their total cause, for guaranteed ongoing supplies that secure its rule in Gaza, once it ensured that no-one touches the funnel of UNRWA, the only additional deal to which it would agree - as it made repeatedly clear, is one that goes back to October 6th: Hamas remains in charge of Gaza, of the border with Egypt that has been the site of endless supplies for its army and economy, Israel withdraws completely, and they can continue receiving billions from the world through UNRWA and other channels, so as to be even more effective executors of acts of mass murder in the future. 

Hamas executes hostages or attempts to do so when Israeli soldiers are close to releasing them, because the one thing they cannot accept is to have the lowly Jews rescue their own people. The kidnapped hostages are Hamas' insurance policy to continue to fight until there is no more Israel.

In the face of a totalizing ideology that plays a long game with an annihilationist goal, there is only moral position for any government/international organization is to pursue (and should have been the policy from October 8th):

Unconditional release of the hostages

Unconditional surrender of Hamas

That is the only thing that ends the immediate war

(Ending Palestinianism as the ideology that negates a sovereign Jewish state in any borders is necessary to end the bigger century long war). 

And until then? It is war, and should be waged as such, with no illusions about the enemy we face."
1f77ylx,Why are people saying the protests yesterday helped Hamas?,2024-09-02 14:21:53,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f77ylx/why_are_people_saying_the_protests_yesterday/,"After the recovery of the 6 bodies of Israeli hostages murdered by Hamas in Gaza, public outrage had occurred and massive protests started in all of Israel. The outrage is due to Bibi intentionally sabotaging a deal, time after time (Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-cease-fire-talks.html). If he hadn't, the hostages might have been home alive rather than being returned by the IDF when they're dead. In May, Israel submitted a proposal for a hostages deal, and to the government's surprise, Hamas had agreed to almost all of it - so Israel (Bibi) submitted a revised offer with more provisions, so that the deal intentionally wouldn't be approved.

In this way, Bibi uses the hostages to stay in power, because he knows the public expects him to resign once the war ends.

Due to that, the Israeli public went out in hundreds of thousands to protest yesterday. This had sparked comments online that these protests and the general strike announced help Hamas, and that a hostages deal now will just lead to another October 7th.

This misses two key points:

1. Hamas can easily recruit thousands of new terrorists. Gazans are radicalized due to the intense bombing campaign and hate us more than before, so it's easier for Hamas now to recruit new terrorists. The value of the released terrorists in a deal isn't very significant.

2. October 7th could have been easily prevented if there were enough soldiers on the border & earlier warnings by the lookout soldiers on the border. This attack was not due to the Philadelphi Corridor being open - it was due to leniency on Israel's part.

Finally, I don't understand how these protests empower Hamas. A hostages deal won't empower them. What empowers them is the constant bombing campaign that further radicalizes Gazans against us, and when we pull out of Gaza, they could rebuild themselves (and we won't occupy it like we did before 2005, because that's against international law and the world won't let us).

I was one of the protestors yesterday in Kaplan, so just trying to understand the logic of those against the protests."

Hamas is using the hostages as a powerful leverage point, forcing Israel into a no-win situation: act militarily and risk the lives of the hostages, or negotiate and potentially compromise Israel‚Äôs long-term security. The Israeli government is facing immense pressure from within as families demand action, but the options on the table are fraught with risks and potential devastating consequences.

1f6qrmz,Hamas Holds Hostages. Israel Does Not.,2024-09-01 22:15:54,162,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f6qrmz/hamas_holds_hostages_israel_does_not/,"The hostages are back in the headlines, under horrific circumstances. And along with them, the pernicious Pro-Palestinian misconception that since Israel holds Palestinians without trial, it is ""holding hostages"", just as much as Hamas. And indeed, holds much more hostages than Israel. I'd like to point out that this is a completely baseless argument. Hostages are not merely people held without trial. The issue is not muddy, is not subjective. International Law is crystal clear on the difference between the two. 

# Taking hostages

Hostage takers are defined in the 1979 International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages as:

> Any person who seizes or detains and threatens to kill, to injure or to continue to detain another person (hereinafter referred to as the ""hostage"") in order to compel a third party, namely, a State, an international intergovernmental organization, a natural or juridical person, or a group of persons, to do or abstain from doing any act as an explicit or implicit condition for the release of the hostage commits the offence of taking of hostages (""hostage-taking"") within the meaning of this Convention

Note that it doesn't include any reference to whether the person was detained with or without a trial, whether the person is a minor, whether the person is ""innocent"" or whether they're even a combatant or not. The only point here is holding and possibly threatening a person, for the specific desire to **compel a third party** into some action or inaction. Mere unjust detainment, of any sort, wouldn't qualify as ""hostage taking"", unless that element is satisfied. Similar language exists in the Elements of Crime for the ICC.

The practice of taking hostage is full-on, no-exceptions, 100% completely illegal, since the end of WW2. Unreservedly illegal under the Geneva Conventions (a ""grave breach"" of the 4th Geneva Conventions, prohibited further under Additional Protocols 1 and 2), a war crime under the ICC, and obviously a violation of the Hostage Convention. 

# Internment

""Internment"" in International Law, means putting people in jail, without a trial, for security reasons. Or, as it's usually phrased, a form of detainment by the executive power, rather than the judicial.

Internment, on its own, is a **fully legal** measure, which is directly allowed and regulated by several articles of the 4th Geneva Convention (41, 42, 68, 78, 43, etc.). It has a few legal requirements, like ""the security of the Detaining Power makes it absolutely necessary"", it having to be approved by a competent legal authority, and the right to appeal the decision every six months. But even the fact it's regulated at all, shows that it's a legal practice.

# What Hamas is currently doing

On Oct. 7, Hamas has kidnapped 226 Israeli civilians, from babies to senior citizens. They were either kidnapped from their homes, or a music festival. They also captured 25 soldiers during that point, most famously the female lookouts, who were monitoring the border. Most of those were either released or dead. At the moment, Hamas holds 97 hostages, with at least 33 of them are assumed dead.

Hamas *isn't* arguing that any of the civilians were captured because they formed any threat to their national security. Hamas is occasionally using the language of POWs regarding the 11 potentially living soldiers it's still holding, but even if we'd treat Hamas as a legal army that's allowed to have POWs, it refuses to grant them any rights that POWs would be eligible for. And, as I mentioned, it wouldn't matter even if it did - POWs could still be held illegally as hostages, especially if their lives are threatened. As Btselem, by no means a pro-Israeli organization, noted in the Gilad Shalit case:

> Seizing a person (civilian or combatant) and holding him or her forcibly with the objective of pressuring the other side to meet certain demands is absolutely prohibited, and is considered hostage taking. This act is much more grievous when it is accompanied by a threat to kill or injure the hostage if the hostage-takers' demands are not met. Furthermore, breach of the prohibition is deemed a war crime, for which everyone involved in the act bears personal criminal responsibility. The circumstances in which Shalit was abducted and held clearly indicate that he was taken hostage.

And as we'll see in the case of the Bargaining Chips with Israel.

Hamas openly and proudly admits, that they're holding people to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners, as well as military concessions. Withdrawal from parts or all of the strip, guarantees against assassinating their leadership, possibly the end of the war. There is no question whatsoever, that those people are hostages, in the full legal sense of the word, and not mere ""prisoners"" or any other intermediate status.

# What Israel is currently doing

Israel usually holds a few hundreds of people under Administrative Detention and under the Unlawful Combatants Law, but that number spiked since that war. At the moment, according to the Israeli human rights NGO [HaMoked](https://hamoked.org.il/), it interns 3,432 people, through the Administrative Detention practice, laid out in the [1979 Emergency Regulation Powers Law](https://www.nevo.co.il/law_html/law00/73211.htm). And 1,584 people due to the more controversial [Unlawful Combatants Law of 2002](https://www.nevo.co.il/law_html/law01/187m1_001.htm), that deals specifically with  members of terrorist organizations, who are neither enemy soldiers, nor subject to Israeli civilian or military law. This is used especially for Gazans, which isn't considered to be under Israeli legal authority of any kind. 

Under Israeli law, and International Law, the Ministry of Defense argues, that every single person under Administrative Detention or the Unlawful Combatants Law is held because they're an individual threat to Israeli national or public security, or actual members of a terrorist organization.

There are criticisms of this practice, from the morality of the very idea of internment without trial (even if it's legal under International Law), to whether all of the detainees satisfy the ""absolutely necessary"" legal requirement, under both Israeli and International Law - especially in the way it's implemented in the Unlawful Combatants Law. In addition, there's an ongoing criminal investigation into torture and rape of some of the detainees in the Sde Teiman holding facility, by the untrained soldiers that were recruited to guard them. Some talk about the inherent lack of transparency and accountability of the process, have issues with specific people who were detained, and later found to be completely innocent. Or even people who *aren't* completely innocent, but were treated too harshly, or should've given the benefit of legal due process. Others point to specific violations of the rights the interned under the Geneva Convention, like being held within the occupied territory, rather than within the enemy's borders. 

However, there's no serious argument made, let alone provide any evidence, that Israel is only detaining those Palestinians, to compel Hamas or any other third party into action or inaction. The entire argument seems to rest on misunderstanding of the term ""hostages"", or assuming that this term is somehow ill-defined or subjective. That it covers any kind of illegal or even immoral detainment. To be clear: that's not the case. Even if all of the criticisms against Israeli Administrative Detainment are fully justified, and every single detainee is held completely illegally and immorally, the people being interned don't become ""hostages"" by default. Nor are they transformed into ""hostages"", because *Hamas* wants to trade them for their actual hostages. Hostage-taking requires a specific intent on the part of Israel, that it simply doesn't have at this point.

# When Israel did hold hostages: the Bargaining Chips case

In the early 1990's, Israel arrested 21 Lebanese citizens on various terrorism charges. From belonging to terrorist organizations (Hezbollah and Amal), to being involved in actual attacks against the IDF. After they served their sentences, instead of being deported to Lebanon, they were held under Administrative Detention, to be used as bargaining chips in future negotiations for the captured Israeli navigator Ron Arad. 

The State argued that for various procedural reasons, the international prohibition on hostage taking didn't apply to these men, and that the Israeli law should allow for such extreme exceptions. The Israeli Supreme Court rejected this view, and they were released. It's notable that, like Gilad Shalit, they were not random innocent people, abducted from a music festival. They were convicted members of terrorist organizations. Furthermore, there was no actual risk, even implicit, that they would be harmed or killed if Arad is not returned. And yet, the goal of holding people as ""bargaining chips"" was found to be plainly illegal under Israeli law, and against the prohibition against hostage taking in international law.

I'd also note two other points:

1. In the early 1990's, there was some debate on whether that prohibition is also a matter of Customary International Law - that question is now considered fully settled.

2. The 2002 Unlawful Combatants Law was made due to this ruling. However, the final product doesn't actually legalize ""bargaining chips"" as a legal reason to detain people. And instead, was deemed by Chief Justice Aharon Barak as a mere new doctrine regarding internment of certain foreign terrorists, rather than anything that actually bypasses his ruling.


# Summary

1. The categories of hostages and interned people, even illegally interned people, is not subjective or muddy. ""One man's hostage is another man's prisoner"" does not apply. International law makes a clear distinction between those categories. Interned people could still be victims of various crimes, and the practice of internment itself might be immoral and undemocratic. But hostages are not merely prisoners who suffer injustices.

2. The Palestinian prisoners in Israel, including those interned without trial, those who are innocent, and those who were abused, raped and even killed in Israeli custody, are not and were not hostages. Regardless of how legal or moral their internment is. As there is no evidence at the moment, that Israel only holds them to compel a third party to some action or inaction. And Israel, of course, doesn't admit to anything like that.

3. The people Hamas abducted and captured, including the soldiers, are hostages. Hamas, unlike Israel, proudly admits that they were captured to extract concessions from Israel. They don't argue that the civilian majority of these abductees posed any danger whatsoever to them. They don't make any serious argument that small group of soldiers are POWs, or try to provide any rights afforded to POWs. And even if they did, Hamas' direct threats to their wellbeing, and open intent to use them as bargaining chips to extract Israeli concessions, make them into hostages either way. Hamas is admitting they're hostages, in every possible way, except actually using the word ""hostage"".

4. The fact the latter group are hostages, and the first group aren't, has nothing to do with the fact Hamas are a terrorist organization, while Israel is a real state, with a real national army. Israel could and did hold hostages, including those who are actual terrorists, and not innocent people. And was ordered not to, by its courts.

Finally, I'd like to stress that Hamas has absolutely no legal right to hold these hostages, or to get any concessions whatsoever in return. Under international law, they're required to hand them back without any preconditions, and then be thrown in jail for severe war crimes. The fact that the current hostage negotiations are being presented as something closer to ""peace talks"" (which they aren't, and never were), where Israel is accused of making ""unreasonable"" demands to get their people back, seem to obscure that fact. Anyone who claims to care about international law or human rights, should take note."
1f6ohxh,Serious discussion: What did Hamas expect when they launched the war? What were their goals? ,2024-09-01 20:36:45,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f6ohxh/serious_discussion_what_did_hamas_expect_when/,"One thing that confused a lot of people since the beginning of the war is that it is unclear what Hamas expected to happen. We have seen many wars in recent years. When Russia invaded Ukraine, they expected Ukraine to quickly collapse. When the US invaded Afghanistan, they expected the Taliban to disintegrate. And the list goes on. 

According to the most recent estimate, 6,000 Palestinians entered Israel, including 3,800 Hamas terrorists. This number is insufficient to cause enough damage to destroy Israel. Hamas did attack some military infrastructures. But even if they intended to attack Dimona (Israel‚Äôs nuclear facility) or key air bases, they just did not have enough manpower to achieve the goal. 

Instead, the focus of their operation was to murder and kidnap civilians. They murdered 797 civilians, killed and/or executed 379 Israeli combatants, and kidnapped 251 people (including non-Jewish foreign workers). 

**What doesn‚Äôt add up is that the scale of the invasion is too significant for Israel to not respond with a full-scale war. But it is not enough to be a devastating blow that could trigger Israel‚Äôs collapse.** 

One could NOT explain this as a standard terror attack. Hamas is not just a terrorist organisation, they are a de facto state government. Terrorist organisations use terror attacks to advertise themselves. So they could recruit new terrorists and receive donations. Hamas has a large population to recruit from, and they have plenty of cash at their disposal. So this possibility is ruled out. 

Another possibility is that they sought to negotiate for Palestinian statehood. This can also be ruled out since they are already sovereign. And it makes little sense to pick this approach since they do not have the strength to fight Israel to a stalemate. The pre-war status quo was a de facto stalemate. Why would they break it? 

This also rules out any ‚Äúthey wanted the West to stop supporting Israel‚Äù logic. North Vietnam was able to hold the line. And South Vietnam collapsed the moment US troops withdrew. In essence, Hamas is more like South Vietnam. And‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs not forget that Israel has nukes. If Tel Aviv falls and Jerusalem is occupied, nukes will be launched. 

A lot of people believe their goal was to trigger a disproportionate Israeli repose so they could disrupt the Israeli-Saudi normalisation talks. But these people fundamentally don‚Äôt understand how diplomacy works. These public statements are not the start of anything, they are the results. The US and China became extremely close before they established any official ties. And all of Taiwan‚Äôs most important allies don‚Äôt even officially recognise their statehood. Even during the war, Saudi Arabia intercepted missiles that were aimed at Israel. 

I simply cannot figure out a coherent and logical explanation. I simply cannot accept that they just did it because they wanted the kick. "

1f6cqpk,Who is Daniel Levy? He‚Äôs described as an Israeli ‚ÄúNegotiator‚Äù in the late ‚Äò90s/‚Äò00s,2024-09-01 12:00:04,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f6cqpk/who_is_daniel_levy_hes_described_as_an_israeli/,"Hi all! I have been following this conflict since October and I try to be as unbiased as possible as I recognize this conflict is decades old and quite complicated.

I just couldn‚Äôt help but notice many times, across many platforms, Daniel Levy is brought out as an authority on the conflict and he‚Äôs described as an Israeli negotiator for past Israeli Prime Ministers from 20 years ago. 

Who is Daniel Levy? I can‚Äôt find much about him besides his basic r√©sum√© that he was an Israeli negotiator (of what?) for PM Rabin and PM Barak. I‚Äôd be curious to get an Israeli point of view. I ask because Mr. Levy appears to be extremely biased towards the Palestinians (which is fine) but he presents himself as an Israeli political figure to give himself an air of credibility. It gives the audience the impression of ‚ÄúWow, Israel is so bad, even Israeli government advisors are criticizing Israel now.‚Äù

But from what I can tell, Mr. Levy is so biased, that I‚Äôd confuse him for a Hamas-nik if I didn‚Äôt know better. He appears to be fairly anti-Israel in general, whose views certainly seem out of the mainstream from an American perspective. The few times he mentions October 7th, he doesn‚Äôt seem to care as much about it as the atrocities in Gaza, but it seems he feels he has to mention the October attack occasionally while attacking Israel, to keep the appearance up that he‚Äôs a moderate Israeli just telling hard truths that happen to be an indictment against Israel. As an American, I can‚Äôt imagine even in polarized times, a government figure from either political party being that openly sympathetic towards an enemy country that attacked America. It would be the end of that person‚Äôs credibility and likely career.

It may seem I‚Äôm biased towards Israel from my post but I am not. In fact, I‚Äôm for an end to the war now. I‚Äôm for a tribunal of sorts to examine war crimes committed by both sides. I detest PM Netanyahu and his far-right cabinet. But I just see Mr. Levy as blatantly dishonest and disingenuous the way he presents himself to audiences around the world. I have no issue with anyone being open about their biases. But he appears to use his former Israeli government credentials to bolster his attacks against Israel. His views seem to be outside the Israeli mainstream. Am I correct in that assumption? Thanks!"

1f69umq,About the mistreatment of hostages in captivity,2024-09-01 08:42:59,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f69umq/about_the_mistreatment_of_hostages_in_captivity/,"Ever since the first hostage deal during this war there have been various claims about the treatment of hostages in captivity. I've seen claims that the Israeli hostages were given great conditions, food and medical care and comfort and safety. I clearly remember a comment saying ""hope you had a good time in Gaza hotel, please come again"" under a video of hostages being handed to the red cross. Ever since the first hostage deal, there have been a great many testimonials from hostages contradicting this claim entirely. Yet the lie has surfaced again recently with the [testimony of Noa Argamani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTcFdO_yoH4) where she tells how her captors didn't give her any medical care after she was hurt by an IAF bombing.

But before I delve into this, I would like to say that I don't release the Israeli government from responsibility. I believe that the only way forward should be a hostage deal and a ceasefire. A swift deal, not the one proposed now that will take another 4 months. I demonstrate regularly for the hostages for that purpose. I also don't ignore the evidences from Sde Teiman detention center, I do believe the investigation there should be more thorough and anyone who did wrong should be tried and punished accordingly. **I address these here because I don't want these subjects to take over the discussion. This is a discussion about the lies about the mistreatment of Israelis in captivity.**

In the last two weeks we have found out that 13 hostages have been murdered in captivity by their captors. On August 22nd autopsy found that 6 hostages, Nadav Popplewell, Yoram Metzger, Avraham Munder, Chaim Peri, Yagev Buchshtav, Alex Dancyg, were all shot dead by their captors \[[1](https://www.timesofisrael.com/autopsies-find-bullet-wounds-in-bodies-of-all-6-hostages-recovered-from-gaza-in-raid/)\]. Later a rescued hostage Farhan Alkadi told that Aryeh Zalmanovich, a hostage that was with him, was murdered in captivity \[[2](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkbenptir)\]\[[3](https://www.timesofisrael.com/son-says-aryeh-zalmanovich-86-was-murdered-in-gaza-hospital-next-to-farhan-al-qadi/)\]. And today we are told that 6 more, ¬†Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Ori Danino, Eden Yerushalmi, Almog Sarusi, Alexander Lubnov, and Carmel Gat, were murdered in captivity. This alone should be enough to disprove the ""good treatment"" lie. 

But unfortunately there's more. Amit Soussana had told about the abuse, violence and sexual assault she's been through in captivity \[[4](https://www.timesofisrael.com/released-hostage-amit-soussana-reveals-she-was-sexually-assaulted-by-hamas-captor/)\]\[[5](https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/r1aok54va)\]\[[6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75anxnRPSKY)\]. Mia Regev told about how she was abused and tortured in captivity, and how they mistreated her wounds and use them for torture \[[7](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-784582)\]\[[8](https://www.google.com/search?q=mia+regev+testimony&sca_esv=2f5b823099db8bc2&sca_upv=1&ei=BxzUZsmRIJ669u8PwYPWuQw&ved=0ahUKEwiJscfFoKGIAxUenf0HHcGBNccQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=mia+regev+testimony&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiE21pYSByZWdldiB0ZXN0aW1vbnkyBRAAGIAEMggQABiABBiiBEi2G1CvCViVGnABeAGQAQCYAZIBoAG2CaoBAzAuObgBA8gBAPgBAZgCCqACywnCAgoQABiwAxjWBBhHwgILEAAYgAQYhgMYigWYAwCIBgGQBgWSBwMxLjmgB4AP&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:2ce02174,vid:s51bGs6vNGI,st:0)\].

Almog Meir Jan told in a long interview to Illana Dayan about abusive sadistic guards that abused him, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv \[[11](https://www.haaretz.co.il/?page=1)\]. They used to deny them food, have them stand with their hands tied to a stick for days (terrifyingly similar to crucifixion), beat them, gag them, and mentally abuse them \[[12](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjfnbmajc)\]\[[13](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-811401)\].

Farhan Alkadi who was recently rescued said he was malnourished, denied basic human needs, and was abandoned alone in a tunnel with the doors rigged with explosives. He was left to either die in an underground tunnel or explode with it. Fortunately he was rescued \[[15](https://www.timesofisrael.com/rescued-hostage-said-kept-in-total-darkness-during-captivity-showered-once-a-month/#:~:text=Before%20leaving%2C%20the%20Hamas%20operatives,should%20he%20try%20to%20flee)\]. 

There are so many more testimonials, almost every hostage released tells about constant psychological torture and violence. [Haaretz compiled many testimonials from released hostages](https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politics/2024-03-04/ty-article-timeline/0000018d-59e9-d6b0-adcd-7dfbbd6c0000) (sadly only in Hebrew but you can use machine translation services). Please read those to develop a more informed opinion. 

As of writing this, I realize how little of the testimonials I could find in international media. This may serve to explain why the lies about good treatment are so prevalent. I believe this calls to question the journalistic integrity of international media regarding Israel-Palestine conflict. 

What do you think? Is any of this new to you? Are you still convinced that the captors try to treat the hostages fairly? "

I feel sick to my stomach, especially knowing they were alive until most likely in the last 48 hours. I feel the same doom I felt the months after October 7 all over again. I‚Äôm sick of the loss of so many of our beloved family and friends, young soldiers, grandparents kids, and all the innocent lives. I‚Äôm sick of the hate at Jews, the lack of support for our right in the war to protect and make sure Hamas crumbles to such little pieces it is exterminated forever, and terrified to ever think of even attacking us again. That‚Äôs WHY this war, that we didn‚Äôt even want or start, is necessary. 

Its raining in Israel right now, which is so rare for Sept. it‚Äôs a sign the skies are crying and mourning for the 6 hostages that should‚Äôve been home, missed their family and friends, their lives and work, their favorite meals and favorite songs. To wear their favorite outfit again, or use their own beds. I think of all the hostages every night when I lay in bed and know they can‚Äôt. Especially because one of my own was a hostage released back in Nov 2023. 

But why is this sub quiet on it? Just curious, and do any of you who are pro Palestinian and said ‚Äúall eyes on rafah‚Äù, do even care about this news?

What is egypt's stance with Iran? We know the MBrotherhood is a terror organisation officialy within egypt but does egypt stance with Iran remain neutral?

How did this become a muslim brotherhood and Iran alliance and when did Qatar come into the equation to try to destabilize Israel?

This is a geopolicital enigma for me so far as I only learned about most of this while visiting Israel as a tourist and rocket attacks were common during my time there. 

Is egypt possibly open to a future alliance with Iran as things stand, give. The corruption in the egyptian government?

Is iran looking at egypt as a possible ally to destroy israel?

Is normalisation with egypt and Israel fragile?

My thinking is that Israel has always been in a state of emergency, but it currently seems like the MEast is at some weird stand off since denormalization with Israel makes education of what Israel is/was wrong in the minds of the average arab world citizen. 

The situation for the arab world is quite awkward as they do not even know their knowledge of the history of israel is completely flawed and fake and based on pan arabism/pan islamism.

I feel that this is a missing step in most conversations in these reddit groups and I wish education was better amongst discussion groups as many redditors lack basic historical knowledge about a subject they feel very pattionate about but unfortunately know very little of nothing about. "

Soldiers admit that they kill Palestinians for fun or for revenge. Israeli civilians are now defending colonialism and have said that Palestinians are invaders, even those in the West Bank, whose families have lived there for generations and are now being displaced or killed. Israelis rioted to free IDF soldiers who were imprisoned for abusing prisoners, soldiers who were hailed as heroes on TV. News anchors were arguing that raping Palestian prisoners should be the norm, as to serve as a deterrent to Palestinians for... existing?

Israel has become overrun by far right-wing ideology, the most toxic forms of Zionism, that celebrates bigotry, leading to some of the most horrifying human rights violations. Let's stop denying reality. They are committing a genocide.

You know the way anti-vaxxers or climate denialists deny basic facts and bend over backwards just to defend their ideologies? That's clearly a good portion of you, super hardcore pro-Israel right-wing Zionists. At least the reasonable ones will call out the crimes. Many of you, however, are trying to argue that these atrocities aren't being committed when there's literal video evidence of it. Many of you are also trying to justify it for one reason or another.

Noun

1f5ufda,It's time to be honest,2024-08-31 18:46:48,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f5ufda/its_time_to_be_honest/,"For transparency, i consider myself 'pro-palestine', but i have no connections to Israel or Palestine. I'm an atheist outside observer. I'm writing this after watching [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amz2Sf1JMDE) between Mehdi Hasan and Benny Morris. What struck me is the brutal honesty of Morris, and also the way he was heckled and jeered for it. I found his honesty refreshing, and I feel that this kind of moral pile-on only encourages zionists to lie instead. We need to be honest about human nature. There is one irrefutable fact:

**When backed into a corner, the gloves come off**.

International Law? Forget it. Morality? Dont make me laugh. Rape. Torture. Genocide. Anything is on the cards when your existence is threatened. Regardless of how immoral you may consider the creation of Israel to be. This applies all to of us, Isreali or Palestinian or whoever. This is human nature. But we scorn others for this because we dont want to recognize this in ourselves. We dont want to accept that if we were born into these situations, we would also act this way. So we lie. We make excuses. We make moral judgements as if we are above them. We need to be honest about human nature and work within these constraints.

I believe a 2 state solution is possible. Difficult, very very difficult. But possible. So we need to also be honest about why it's difficult before advocating for it.

We should recognise that Israel has horrible borders. They are long and insecure compared to the size of Israel. Handing over the west bank to Palestinians immediately is suicide. But a stable cooperative future between Plaestine and Israel is possible eventually.

Yes, Palestinians have had horrible leadership, and terrible negotiators. Peace slipped through their hands multiple times. But that's not the fault of the future generation. And also consider another human quirk- the gamblers fallacy. When you lose so much, you keep holding on to recoup your losses. It was tough for them to accept their losses. A finalised agreement would legitimise their losses. They instead wanted an incremental solution, with no final final agreement, as every incremental concession from Israel would increase the Palestinian's leverage. Israel, by contrast, wanted a finalised agreement, unwilling to concede it's current leverage. This is human nature. Let's not condemn people for this, because you would do the same. But it's also obvious that the negotiators (Arafat etc) blew it.

Western governments get a lot of flack for supporting Israel, despite their obvious violations of international law. However, consider what would happen if we pulled the plug? Israel would face an even greaterr existential threat. And they have nukes. Things would get more violent, not less. Israel, quite rightly, will never allow itself to be erased. Gloves off.

I believe that a path is possible out of this madness. Neither side wants this. The west doesnt want this. Nobody wants this. But we are all prisoners of human nature, and we need to admit this first before we can chart a course towards a positive future.

I believe that a 2-state solution is possible. Not now, but in future. The only alternative is the continued horrific ethnic cleansing. It will take generations of political stability for the mutual hatred to subside. People need to grow up without losing their family to terrorism or airstrikes. The next generation bear no responsilbility for this mess.

What is achievable pollitcally is governed by the red-lines of popular opinion. Both sides are held hostage to this. Hamas cannot show contrition. Neither can Israel. But do you remember when Palestinians in gaza were celebrating after the false news of a ceasefire deal? People thought for once that Hamas had achieved something positive and were happy. Any demonstration of progress, no matter how small, shifts those red lines and changes what is politically possible. Incremental, mutual demonstrations of good faith will move the red lines and change what is possible. We put men on the moon. We can do this."

It led me to some very interesting discoveries and are as follows:

1. The civilized and democratic West supports the Jews and has provided them military aid to defend themselves and exist in their homeland while the Global South with authoritarian countries stand with Palestine

2. More men in the West support the Jews while more females empathize with the suffering of Palestine.

3. The experienced and knowledgable older folks such as the boomers support the Jews while naive younger generations tend to support Palestine (eg. Encampments and TikTok videos).

4. Conservatives and Republicans support the Jews and regard them as Chosen People while Liberals and Left-Wingers tend to support the Palestine struggle for liberation.

5. Straight people clearly support the Jews while homosexuals and other LGBTQ groups support Palestine (even though Palestine does not return the favor).

6. White people in the West support the Jews while colored people especially brown ones are in solidarity with Palestine.

7. In Europe, hard working European countries such as Germany support the Jews and have learnt from the Holocaust while lazy Mediterranean ones like Spain and drunk ones like Ireland support Palestine.

8. People with jobs support the Jews while unemployed folks reliant on welfare support Palestine (eg activists in encampments and ones destroying Elbit systems in UK)

9. The police and military who care about defending the nation and rule of law support the Jews while human-rights activists, peace activists, and open-borders campaigners stand with Palestine.

10. Christians across the world support the Jews and consider them as their brothers or Chosen People and subscribe to Judeo-Christian values that define the enlightened West while Muslims across the world support Palestine and many wish to wage jihad against the Jews.

11. Sunni Arab governments support the Jews and are trying to make their populace love the Jews while Shia countries stand with Palestine.

12. Business oriented people with acumen and scientists in academia keen on discovery and new technology support the Jews while social scientists, artists, humanities students and other outlandish unrealistic idealists support Palestine. 

13. Hollywood wholeheartedly supports the Jews while alternative cinema goers and exhibitors support Palestine.

Overall, even though most of the world may support the liberation of Palestine, having seen holocaust documentaries on Netflix, my heart will always be with the Jewish people. I will support the Jews no matter whether they live in NY or in the hilltops of Judea and Samaria!"

I don't know whether that's due to limited information or that it's just irrelevant, but I'm intrigued nonetheless, so I was wondering if people here had any good recommendations of detailed analysis of the following topics:

-Palestine under Djemel Pasha (WW1)

-Arab mandatory terrorist organisations **other** than Izz ad-Din al-Qassam's *Black Hand* (1920-47)

-The Muslim Brotherhood volunteers who'd fought in Palestine in the 1948 war prior to 15 May

-Clashes between the *Holy War Army* and Glubb Pasha's Arab Legion at the very end of the 1948 War

-The Hashemite occupation of the West Bank (1948-67)

-The Egyptian occupation of the Gaza Strip (1948-67)

-Palestinian Fedayeen activities prior to 1964 (specifically whether there were any organised efforts rather than sporadic ones)

-*Fatah's* activities prior to the Battle of Karameh 

-*Fatah's* activities in Lebanon from 1968-70

-The split between Yasser Arafat and George Habash

-The use of the *Abu Nidal Organisation* by the Arab Regimes to assassinate PLO operatives

-The PLO in Lebanon after 1982

-The origins of the fratricidal hatred between Hamas and *Fatah* in the 1990s

-The period of Fitna in the Gaza Strip in 2007 between Hamas and *Fatah*

I know this is very niche stuff, but I'd very much appreciate some resources.

Also, can I request that people replying *directly* to me don't just start arguments without giving me a few names? I just want book recs.

1f5fcnr,What would be a good name if Palestine and Israel United?,2024-08-31 04:49:24,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f5fcnr/what_would_be_a_good_name_if_palestine_and_israel/,The title 
1f5agdl,Columbia Task Force report on Antisemitism,2024-08-31 00:21:05,253,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f5agdl/columbia_task_force_report_on_antisemitism/,"In response to the very visible ""Pro-Palestine"" protests that took over the campus in the spring, Columbia set up a Task Force to investigate antisemitism and provide recommendations. The full report can be found [here](https://president.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/Announcements/Report-2-Task-Force-on-Antisemitism.pdf). 

Here are some broad highlights of behavior that students at Columbia experienced:

1. ""Visibly Jewish"" students were spit on, assaulted, verbally attacked, Nazi symbols and jokes, ethnic slurs, etc. Many chose to hide their Judaism and/or refuse to walk alone on campus.

2. A student collected over 750 antisemitic posts made on Sidechat, accessible *only* to Columbia students.

3. Students were removed from club leadership positions and/or wholly removed from clubs for refusing to support the Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) coalition. Many of these organizations had nothing to do with Israel, Palestine, or the Middle East, but employed litmus tests against members to exclude them. The Law School Student Senate refused to recognize a proposed student group called, ""Law Students Against Antisemitism"". It was the only proposed group that was rejected that year. Quoting the report,

  > All of these examples raise the question of inconsistent standards. We might wonder whether there is any other identity group or nationality singled out in this manner by campus organizations‚Äîwhich receive some financial and institutional support from the University or at least some form of recognition‚Äîand what the response would be if they did.

4. Students were ridiculed, threatened, or dismissed for being Jewish, Israeli, or just believing in contrary viewpoints **in the classroom**.  

  (4.1) A public health class required to take by all incoming freshmen for public health. In this required class, the professor repeated antisemitic tropes, had a guest speaker referring to Israel as ""settler-colonial determinants of health"". Another dissuaded engaging with anybody disputing the ""settler-colonial framework.""  

  (4.2) The Bernard & Teacher's College called on all faculty to hold classes, office hours, and meetings on Columbia lawns, in or near the encampments. This discriminated against people who did not support the encampments or were not welcome in them and those students were unfairly denied education.  

  (4.3) Students left or avoided majors to avoid faculty that were showing bias towards the encampments, fearing they would be treated unfairly based on their ethnicity or beliefs.

  (4.4) Classroom discussions based on ""justice"" sought to exclude Zionism and Jews. In a discussion about the Holocaust, a Jewish student brought up her grandmother, a refugee from the Holocaust, the professor said, ""I think you‚Äôre going to have to sit on that.""
  
  (4.5) Finally, again the Task Report said,

  >One might well, again, raise the question of the inconsistent standards with regard to these various examples: would any other religious group or nation‚Äîor, for that matter, any other legally protected identity group‚Äîbe treated similarly?

5. During the encampments, students were inundated with antisemitic chants, celebrations of Hamas, and overt chants calling on the destruction and extermination of all Israelis. Jewish and Israeli students were assaulted and threatened routinely.

6. Israeli students were specifically targeted. They were assaulted, classmates and former friends turned against them with accusations of genocide and allegations of being ""a dangerous veteran"" simply because of Israeli's mandatory IDF service. **A faculty member** told a female Israeli, former IDF, that she was a murderer. As mentioned above, when classes were moved to the encampments, Israeli students were excluded from class.

7. The Task Force notes that the students are **NOT** asking for protection from ideas or arguments. But when they went to the administration, they were routinely told to seek mental health counseling or suggested to leave campus themselves. Their DEI programs wholly exclude Jews.

-------------------------------------

I want to be clear: reasonable people can disagree on topics and that should be ok. It's why subs like this exist. But nobody should be excluded from education based on their beliefs, who they are, or where they were born -- which is what happened at Columbia this spring.

And more importantly, **NONE OF THIS** made Palestine any freer."
1f57cse,About the definition of Zionism and its demonisation. Some thoughts.,2024-08-30 21:56:47,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f57cse/about_the_definition_of_zionism_and_its/,"It's not Zionism per se that's the problem, but the things the Israeli government is doing. Hint: the actions of the Israeli government are not Zionism. Zionism has many different strands, from the most liberal one or two staters who support Palestinian equality and oppose occupation and settlements, to the Kahanists who support ethnic cleansing of Palestinians and expansion. The problem is when Western Jewish Zionists mean a vague cultural attachment to the idea of Israel but they strongly oppose Bibi and the Israeli government's actions, and anti-Zionists think they mean ""We support every fascist policy of the current Israeli government"", which is not the same thing at all.

Zionism is a theory which could be implemented in many different ways, some of which don't even involve a state - some early Zionists just wanted an autonomous area inside a mostly Arab state, but their version didn't win out amongst the people in charge at the time. Zionism in and of itself takes no political positions other than that Jews should have some form of self-determination in the land of Israel, and not all versions of Zionism are anti-Palestinian. This is why it's very dangerous when anti-Zionists treat even the most liberal versions of Zionism as akin to Kahanism and demonise liberal Jews for simply having a vague attachment to the land of Israel. This vague attachment has been enough to get the most progressive Jews ousted from progressive spaces, because any version of Israel in any borders, no matter what its government, is deemed unacceptable by the groups' overlords.

Having said that, I also think there are bad actors in the anti-Israel camp that relish the ambiguity and use it as a way to launder their antisemitism. I wouldn't say it's a huge faction, but those people certainly exist. The Islamic Republic's propaganda has a lot to answer for here.

You can oppose the actions of the Israeli government, but that's not the same as opposing the very right of Israel to exist NO MATTER ITS POLICIES. Israel could completely change its policies towards the Palestinians tomorrow (it's not likely, I know) - no state is beyond saving. Germany still exists; the Nazis were ousted but the state wasn't destroyed. Likewise, people who oppose the Islamic Republic occupying Iran don't call for the destruction of Iran, they call for regime change. But for some reason this is different? Double standards abound. What happened to moral consistency? There should be the exact same energy here.

The Palestinians deserve freedom and rights. How that looks or should happen is not up to me, but Hamas isn't it. Nothing I say here is a defence of the Israeli government, which I despise. However, people need to stop talking past each other when they talk about Zionism - which does not mean the worst excesses of the Israeli government, as I said.

The founding of Israel was bad, but it's not the issue. Most Israelis are Mizrahi, and the majority were born there. Calling for people born there to be expelled is not right either. A lot of the pro-Palestinian side concentrates on indigeneity and historical ties to the land, which is just blood-and-soil nationalism - and if it's bad for Israelis, it's bad for Palestinians too, but they don't see this double standard. If ethnostates are bad, ""Palestine is Arab"", calling Ashkenazis born there ""European immigrants"" while erasing the existence of the Mizrahi forming the majority - and calling for Jews born there to be expelled - is still blood-and-soil stuff and just as bad. Taking this line to its logical conclusion, you could call for all people of non-European descent to be deported from Europe, which most people agree is reprehensible, so why is it suddenly acceptable in the Middle East?

Jews born there are not responsible for the actions of the terror groups that committed the Nakba. People are not responsible for the actions of their ancestors. If you say the creation of Israel was an injustice that must be undone and all its citizens and their descendants sent back where they came from, this act of undoing it would be an injustice to generations of innocents born there, who are equally innocent. So a compromise MUST be reached for the innocents on ALL sides. Not all Israelis commit war crimes, and not all Palestinians are terrorists. Let's not lose our humanity, no matter which side we're on.

I'm not pro-Israel, but I really don't like the excesses of either side here.

EDIT: Zionist is also used ambiguously. Most Zionists, meaning supporters of Israel, are American Christians. So when pro-Palestinians say ""Zionists bombed children"" they don't mean supporters of Israel, they mean Israelis. So why don't they say Israelis if they don't actually mean Zionists (supporters of Israel)? Is it some aversion to using the name Israel? By doing this, they create even more ambiguity."
1f55xhz,"My opinion Kamala Harris is a disappointment, but she's a Better alternative han Donald Trump?",2024-08-30 20:55:05,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f55xhz/my_opinion_kamala_harris_is_a_disappointment_but/,"Vice President Kamala Harris said U.S. policy on arming Israel will not change if she is elected president,¬†echoing the Biden administration's line on expressing tepid sympathy for Palestinians being killed and starved in Gaza while staunchly affirming support for Israel's vicious military conduct in the war.

Kamala Harris may be a disappointment, but she‚Äôs still a better alternative than Donald Trump, who could escalate the Israel-Palestine conflict to a whole new level.

Some of you may be angry with me for saying this, while others might agree. The bottom line is that Harris is better than Trump, and withholding votes won‚Äôt change anything, unfortunately. Even if abandoning Harris leads to the Democrats losing the election, we‚Äôd still be in the same predicament‚Äîbut without someone who understands the suffering of Palestinians. Instead, we could end up with a dictatorial and fascist leader who doesn‚Äôt care about Palestinians in the United States and might even resort to extreme measures against them.

If you think Harris is bad, consider that Trump could be a monster. Look at his agenda, which includes harming the Muslim community. The idea of abandoning Harris comes from a place of frustration, but withholding votes is not a smart strategy, and the third option is just as problematic as the second.

The campaign to abandon Harris may mean well, but the far right would only make things worse by attacking the progressive and Muslim communities. It‚Äôs not worth it to spite Harris and end up with someone who supports Netanyahu‚Äôs genocidal goals.

It‚Äôs not worth it to spite Harris and end up with someone like Netanyahu‚Äôs ally, who agrees with his genocidal goals. I agree with the uncommitted movement on this issue, even though I‚Äôm not American. They‚Äôre trying to work with Harris, but she keeps making poor decisions regarding how to stop this war. While she deserves some of the blame, we should not lose sight of our true enemy: Donald Trump. Netanyahu wants Trump to win. Netanyahu is a two-faced fascist and genocidal murderer.

You might disagree with me, but if we elect Harris, we can stand against this. We need more representation from the Muslim community in Congress and the Senate within the Democratic Party to ensure Harris listens to them. We must also work to get big money out of government for good.

You might not want to vote for Harris, or maybe you feel like you have no other option. But we must unite against something far worse."

1f52ej1,Israel's right to exist and the pro Palestine side,2024-08-30 18:27:27,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f52ej1/israels_right_to_exist_and_the_pro_palestine_side/,"Genuine question here, I'm a Zionist (ie, I believe Israel has a right to exist as a country and people) but I will criticize the IDF. It's a government run by people, so of course it will have issues of corruption and bad behavior. I'm also anti Putin and against the current government of China. But just cuz I dislike both governments doesn't mean Russia or China can no longer exist. I think the only country I don't want to exist technically is North Korea, but that's a thing for another day (will discuss more if asked and is relevant to convo).

One of my biggest gripes against the pro Palestine movement (who Imma just dub proPals for brevity) and its many organizations, such as the Students for Justice in Palestine to name one example, is this concept of ""Israel should not exist."" Not ""the IDF needs to change/current leaders removed,"" not ""Israel needs to remove its settlements,"" and not even ""Israel needs to share with Palestine.""

Now, this is where I find myself more confused than in disagreement, in all honesty. At first I took it at face value and assumed it was a very antisemitic remark, but aling with this confusion of relating all Zionists to being entirely pro IDF (a stance I don't get. There are communists who hated the USSR and/or China, both described themselves as communist regime, as example) as well as this denial of any concerning antisemitic co opts trying to take root in your movement. Gotta keep the bad actors out.

You also got this chant, from the river to the sea, and I and many others keep asking, what sea and what river? If it's from the Jordanian river to the Red Sea, are you implying everyone already there just coexist? Or do you want all Israelis out? If so, where would they go? And I'm not just talking about the recent migrants to Israel. I'm talking about the Ethiopian Jews, many of whom are still stuck in camps waiting for their turn, and the Palestinian Jews who have resided there for as long, if not longer than their Palestinian Arab cousins.

And while we focus on Gaza when there's also the West Bank, what's your thoughts on treating, what many governments across the world classify as a terrorist organization, as a legit government? When we receive news from Hamas sponsored sites, do you ever pause to think who this information is coming from? [Especially after they made something like this that eerily mirrors another youth centric fascist group.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow's_Pioneers) I can even provide a video that covers over this.

And don't even get me started on Al Jazeera and its branch offices. Are you going to forget that the central branch has been exposed numerous times for anti Western and antisemitic (like actual antisemitic stuff.) And yes I got sources. [Here's the Wikipedia article as a more general coverage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera_controversies_and_criticism)

And if you happen to be one of the proPals that wants a two state solution/everyone lives together, have fellow proPals pressured you to think differently? Again, genuinely curious and I'm not here to call everyone on that side antisemitic. It's just hard, especially when you see or hear things that border on stuff you know who would say.

Again, I hope to get some introspective on your stance, even if we end up not agreeing. I'd rather understand your stance and disagree with it than conflate it with falsehoods."
1f51926,Criticism of Palestinian leadership,2024-08-30 17:39:36,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f51926/criticism_of_palestinian_leadership/,"Hello,

I am trying to understand why there is not more criticism of Palestinian leadership. It's not absent, but it seems to be almost a taboo subject among Palestinian supporters. I get there are different opinions on Hamas and I'm not here to discuss their ideology per se, but Hamas seems to have failed Palestinians in multiple ways. They don't allow criticism and I've read they put down opposition violently. Suspected traitors they've beheaded without trial. There has been a large amount of money funneled to weapons, etc. rather than to the Palestinian people.

The response sometimes I hear is how Israel is worse. I understand Netanyahu and Smotrich and those hard right-wing Israelis have caused massive destruction, so many innocent Palestinian kids killed. Maybe they are worse than Hamas, but I do actually hear a lot of criticism of those guys on the Israeli side.

Also when I read about the Palestinian Authority, even most Palestinians believe they are very corrupt. With the corruption and civil war with Hamas it sounds brutal. Arafat as I understand was a dictator and ultra-wealthy. It doesn't seem he had the average Palestinian's best interest at heart.

TLDR: Why isn't there more criticism/accountability of Palestinian leadership? If Palestinians had more accountable leadership, seems like they could be in a better position."

1f4ubnj,Support for Israel among Americans has generational and partisan divides. How should Israeli policy navigate this change?,2024-08-30 12:44:13,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f4ubnj/support_for_israel_among_americans_has/,"Compilation of polling and analysis from the Chicago Council on Global Policy: https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/israels-war-gaza-partisan-racial-and-generational-views-us-role

So, while nearly six-in-10 Democrats favor exerting diplomatic pressure (19 percent) or reducing military aid to Israel (38 percent), half of Republicans (49 percent) think the U.S. should let Israel pursue whatever policy it thinks is best.
This gap between Democrats and Republicans on foreign policy ‚Äî and America‚Äôs role in the world ‚Äî is one that‚Äôs been steadily evolving over the past decade. It‚Äôs a shift that reflects a fundamental change in the Republican Party, which has largely abandoned its Reaganite influence to return to its more isolationist pre-World War II roots. And the change is now apparent at the top of the Republican ticket, with both former U.S. President Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance echoing the narrow nationalism of their predecessors from nearly a century ago.](https://www.politico.eu/article/united-states-divide-foreign-policy-democrats-republicans/)

Many Independents also feel that Israel is targeting all Palestinians (47%). The opposite pattern is evident when respondents were asked whether Israel is doing enough to protect Palestinian civilians. Almost four in 10 overall think Israel is doing enough (38% a great deal or fair amount), but this figure rises to 59 percent among Republicans.

Edit: 

Starter Questions for discussion:

Has Netanyahu‚Äôs courting of the Republican Party, and Trump in particular, affected Israel‚Äôs policy goals and standing in the world? Has this been positive or negative?

For those who feel American policy towards Israel will not change over the mid to long term, why? Is this dependent on policy changes towards Palestinians?

To those who feel Israeli democracy is in significant danger from Netanyahu, Ben-Gvir smotrich etc, what role should America have in neutralizing their ability to harm Israeli society and American-Israeli mutual interests? Are American sanctions effective policy?"

Hello, I am wondering if any of the scenes of death and destruction in Gaza are shown in the media or seen on Israeli social media. I think a large contributor to the increasing global support towards the Palestinian side comes from all the videos, photos, and documentation coming out of Gaza and being spread on social media showing Palestinians trapped in extreme distress, IDF acting poorly, mass graves, blown apart babies, the destruction of homes, hospitals, universities, infrastructure, and other cultural institutions, and widespread famine. 

Is this a case of parallel truths? Where the two sides are getting a different story?

How much of this is shown on Israeli media or social media? Do Israelis see a Palestinian perspective in media and if yes, how does that impact public opinion? How do people react? How do Israelis feel about the military operation? The death toll, blockade, bombings, etc, the potential for a ceasfire? 

I ask because from a U.S context, photos of the Haditha massacre committed  in 2005 by American marines during the Iraq War were released yesterday after being suppressed for 19 years and the brutality documented is causing renewed great controversy about the brutality of the American military. The war was already deeply unpopular and the photos if released at the time would have made a strong case for withdrawal, just like the photos from My Lai for the Vietnam War. 

Basically are Israelis seeing what the rest of the world are and how are they reacting? "

1f49sx5,How Western left-of-center public perception of the Israel-Palestine conflict became so anti-Israel,2024-08-29 18:31:14,107,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f49sx5/how_western_leftofcenter_public_perception_of_the/,"I, like a lot of people, have wondered at how suddenly it has become a dominant position in certain circles to be extremely anti-Israel. Twenty-five years ago, almost no one I knew in the West had any real opinion on Israel or the conflict unless they had a personal connection to it. Now, the vast majority of my acquaintance express strong anti-Israel sentiment (up to and including that Israel is a fundamentally evil entity and should be ‚Äúdisbanded‚Äù) and default to believing dubious claims about the conflict without any apparent awareness of their dubiousness. How did we get to the point where the default position in left-of-center circles is largely anti-Israel? Here are my thoughts. I would love to hear what people agree or disagree with, and what other developments people think should be included.

**My Arbitrary Starting Point**

Prior to Sep. 11, 2001, the Israel-Palestine conflict was a thing that was in the news, but unless you had some personal connection to it, hardly anyone in the western public knew anything about it other than that it was a conflict in the Middle East and occasionally there were flare-ups and people died, and that peace deals kept being attempted and failing. I‚Äôm going to take this as my starting point, and identify the following as major subsequent developments.

**2001: 9/11**

Then 9/11 happened. In the aftermath, there was overzealousness in the ‚Äúwar on terror‚Äù and there was rising Islamophobia in the US, including [attacks on Arabs and Muslims](https://abcnews.go.com/US/20-years-911-islamophobia-continues-haunt-muslims/story?id=79732049), and unjustified racial profiling by Western police forces. This moved Muslims in the West into the status of a victimized class that needed progressives to [stand up for them](https://www.cfr.org/article/us-muslims-and-turbulent-post-911-world). It also led to the belief that most concerns about Islamic terrorism are invented or overblown (thanks to Bush II and Blair especially for that), and that [even discussing Islamic terrorism was suspect ](https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5437&context=flr)as [relying on racist stereotypes](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/moving-target-is-homeland-still-racist/). And it led to a view of the US and the West generally as terrorizers of innocent muslims and middle-easterners. It had the effect of making being concerned about islamic terrorism basically a right-wing/conservative/anti-progressive value.

**2016: Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders**

For many of us who travel in left-leaning circles, there was a sudden moment where the number of people we knew who identified as socialists or Marxists or various permutations of similar political identities [jumped](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/29/why-are-there-suddenly-millions-of-socialists-in-america) from maybe a handful to an actual majority of our acquaintance. It was [recognizably a trend/bandwagon](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/socialism-and-young-socialists.html), rather than people individually just happening to evolve toward that politics. Capitalism became a dirty word. ‚ÄúOppressor‚Äù became a part of ordinary people‚Äôs vocabulary. Imperialist and neocon became common insults to anyone insufficiently critical of the military in general and Western influence in the larger world. Discussion of the harms of colonialism and ‚ÄúWestern imperialism‚Äù led to a surface understanding in the less educated that more Western generally means more ‚Äòbad.‚Äô Wealth makes you most likely a bad person and an oppressor, poverty makes you generally virtuous and oppressed. Marxism also has a complicated relationship and history with both anti-zionism and antisemitism.

**2018: TikTok and the YouTube algorithm**

TikTok and other social media developments fundamentally changed the way people, especially younger people, receive news and information. Ideas that can be conveyed simply and quickly carry the day. Understandings that require a lot of reading and context get sidelined. The TikTok and YouTube (and other social media) [algorithms](https://podcastreview.org/review/rabbit-hole/) are feeding people certain types of stories, leading to increased polarization and one-sided understandings of issues. The resulting increased marginalization of newspapers and professional news organizations means brief, contextless video clips and talking heads with no qualifications or professional obligations of accuracy become the main source of news and information for many people.

**2020: Black Lives Matter (BLM)**

BLM turned everyone left of center into an activist. Celebrities and even ordinary people we knew were blasted for not speaking up‚Äî[silence was complicity](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-silence-on-social-media-why-not-saying-anything-is-actually-saying-a-lot/). Not being informed or politically active was not accepted as an excuse. If you‚Äôre not speaking up against it, you‚Äôre part of the problem. [If you ""have power,"" you have an obligation to use it](https://icma.org/articles/pm-magazine/silence-complicity-can-white-america-demonstrate-black-lives-matter). There are good guys and bad guys. If you want to be considered one of the good guys, you can‚Äôt be complacent. This movement also of course led to a view of police, and eventually the military too, as fundamentally bad guys. This time period also saw a rise in [young people](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220803-gen-z-how-young-people-are-changing-activism) expressing an interest in being professional activists when they grow up, entering university programs majoring in anti-oppression and social justice, etc., creating a pool of activists in search of a cause.

**2020: COVID and lockdowns**

COVID lockdowns led to increased isolation, increased terminally online-ness, and an increase in people seeking community and forms of participation online. [People got even more of their information through online networks, and people's consumption of news and information skyrocketed](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/07/technology/coronavirus-internet-use.html).

**2021: Mainstreaming of Critical Race Theory (CRT)**

The BLM movement also mainstreamed [critical race theory](https://www.britannica.com/topic/critical-race-theory). CRT became an important topic as people tried to understand the sometimes subtle effects of racism in modern society. Suddenly everyone was talking about it‚Äîbut mostly getting it totally wrong. What people came away from it with was a belief that power structures are everything, or at least by far the most important thing. A default assumption developed that by identifying the more powerful party in a relationship or interaction, you could also identify who was in the wrong. A more powerful party is a default abuser of power. A less powerful party is by default a victim, not at fault. An example of this is that racism itself came to be redefined by many as ‚Äúprejudice + power,‚Äù such that it is literally impossible for, say, a Black person to be racist, because as a group they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have the power‚Äù to be so (yes‚Äîfor such individuals a Black person attacking an Asian person and spewing racist epithets at them is no longer an example of racism). (There is a subtle distinction between prejudice and racism that can render this definition less ridiculous sounding, but, because this is the general public we are talking about, that distinction gets lost). The [political right seized on this development as a culture war tool](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/how-a-conservative-activist-invented-the-conflict-over-critical-race-theory&ved=2ahUKEwjD5qmm5pqIAxWPhYkEHfjrICcQFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3xfGXy5HG1UH3pxofghHKN), increasing its spread and its polarization power.

**2021: Sheikh Jarrah evictions**

A [very successful online campaign](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/middle-east/how-east-jerusalem-flashpoint-sheikh-jarrah-got-its-own-hashtag-idUSKCN2CY17W/) brought the [Sheikh Jarrah evictions](https://mondoweiss.net/2021/04/it-is-a-nakba-campaign-to-save-sheikh-jarrah-builds-momentum-as-forced-displacement-looms/?utm_source=mailpoet&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=mondoweiss-wire-submissions) to mainstream attention, while doing little to provide the complicated context around them. For people primed to see a villain and a victim, and getting their news from social media video clips, this is what they saw. This brought the view of Israel as a colonial project that is literally kicking indigenous people out of their homes into the mainstream.¬†

**Ongoing: NGO and IGO increased bias**

I wrote [a post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/182urc7/ngohuman_rights_groups_and_apparent_bias/) a few months ago. [Human Rights Watch](https://www.timesofisrael.com/outgoing-human-rights-watch-senior-editor-blasts-groups-infected-work-on-israel/) and [Amnesty International](https://www.thetimes.com/article/amnesty-directors-links-to-global-network-of-islamists-m0wggtnzcgc) are the worst offenders. Both these organizations have a wide reach and strong reputation as defenders of human rights. Unfortunately over the years they have both become recognizably anti-Israel, devoting far more time to discussions of Israel's wrongdoing than the many much worse HR offenders in the world, such as North Korea or Iran. The UN bodies whose positions are taken based on politics and bloc/coalition votes also lend an air of legitimacy to what are fundamentally political statements, and their [bias](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/FA/FA06/20230622/116138/HHRG-118-FA06-Wstate-NeuerH-20230622.pdf) is also [apparent](https://www.timesofisrael.com/un-condemned-israel-more-than-all-other-countries-combined-in-2022-monitor/).

**Lead-up to 10/7**

So now we have the following dichotomy in place:

Israel:

* Western in nature and culture
* Partner of the US and the West in imperialist and neoconservative aims in the region
* Supposedly white (at least relatively)
* Powerful
* Wealthy
* Military/police state
* Colonial/non-indigenous

¬†Palestine:

* non-Western in nature and culture
* Muslim/protected victim class
* POC
* Victim of imperialism
* Impoverished
* Less powerful
* Indigenous

And with this dichotomy, we have a group of people primed to fall into simplistic good guy/bad guy views of the world, both by nuance-flattening superficial CRT understandings and TikTok/YouTube information patterns, and a generation of people who have committed themselves to social justice looking for a cause they can stand up for. So what do they conclude? Israel is an oppressor that must be stood up against. Palestine is a victim that must be stood up for. Whatever else there might be to it is secondary, and being wishy-washy about what‚Äôs right and wrong here is just a way of allowing the wrong to persist. Any ways in which Israel is a victim can be ignored, because they are more powerful (and anyway, Islamic terrorism is barely a real thing anyway and talking about probably means you are racist). Any ways in which Palestine might be at fault or responsible must be excused or explainable, because they are oppressed.¬†

For people who now are culturally required to take a position on social issues like these, but do not have a deep education (or a willingness to get one) on these issues, a simple narrative easily carries the day. It is clear which position you should hold if you want to be viewed as standing up for the right things. Taking a position like ‚Äúit‚Äôs complicated‚Äù makes you at best suspect, and at worst complicit. Antisemitism, that age-old thumb on the scale, makes it even easier for people to place a nation of Jews into the villain category and to believe the worst claims about them no matter how thin the evidence.

**10/7**

This was an interesting moment/litmus test for the left. Would they be able to maintain their simplistic support for Palestinians and condemnation of Israel in the face of such an attack? The answer was yes. Some [immediately praised the attack](https://www.adl.org/resources/blog/anti-israel-activists-celebrate-hamas-attacks-have-killed-hundreds-israelis) as an example of anti-colonial resistance. Others excused it as at least understandable. Some remained silent about it (‚Äòsilence is complicity‚Äô apparently didn‚Äôt apply in this direction) until Israel responded, at which point they felt free to now simply focus on Israel‚Äôs response and basically forget all about 10/7 or the risk of another 10/7.

**Today**

And that brings us to today. The fact that this is likely the most complex and intractable conflict in  existence, if not in history, has been lost. People think it is simple. When you point out that this is an entire field of study, with countless doctoral theses written about its complexities, you just get blank looks in response. People really do think this is easy, and that tells you definitively how little they actually know."

> The vehicle was hit at least 10 times as it approached the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) checkpoint at the Wadi Gaza Bridge after completing a mission in southern Gaza, the WFP said in a statement. 

> ‚ÄúThough this is not the first security incident to occur during the war it is the first time that a WFP vehicle has been directly shot at near a checkpoint, despite securing the necessary clearances,‚Äù the WFP said.

As a result the WFP has again suspended operations in Gaza.

Does anyone have a defence for this?

Does it indicate a wider problem with military competence, professionalism and discipline within the IDF?

Military competence is about not shooting the wrong people as much as it is about shooting the right people.

Would you support an internal IDF investigation with possible court martial?

Would you support an independent international investigation with possible criminal sanctions?

If not, can you explain why? 

Do you think there is widespread tolerance for this kind of sloppiness among the Israeli population, including the fraction that thinks aid should be stopped?"
1f49hhy,IDF exposed: Hamas falsified public opinion polls in Gaza. The truth: support for the organization is at an all-time low,2024-08-29 18:18:24,114,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f49hhy/idf_exposed_hamas_falsified_public_opinion_polls/,"Hamas 'General Security Mechanism' document revealed that the data of surveyor Khalil Shikaki (the head of the 'Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research'), who is considered the most reliable and was also relied upon in Israel - was falsified in Gaza without his knowledge, to create a false representation of support for the terrorist organization.

In the disclosed documents appears a letter signed by ""Abu Khaled"", according to which

The attached real survey results are confidential and intended for limited circulation. Please forward a copy of them to the head of the mechanism and Abu Nizar for their review.""

# not only opinion polls

A document, revealed today by the IDF, shows first of all the influence of Hamas on the internal elections in Fatah, on the internal elections in Dahlan's stream, on the ""attitudes of the leadership of the Jihad movement"" and on elements in the West Bank in order to thwart any ""contrary influence in relation to the Gaza Strip "", influence on protest activities in Europe and more.

Under the ""security media and public opinion file"", Hamas's general security mechanism details how to influence objective public opinion polls - and also conduct media campaigns in order to sow confusion and influence Hamas' opponents in Petah, protest movements and other bodies. For example, it is written that ""the leaks of intelligence officers who incited to go against Hamas in Gaza should be published, and they should be employed in response to the media materials that are published against them""; Along with ""damaging the good name of the protest movement and the parties responsible for it before it is launched, and linking them to the occupation.""

Under the ""electronic team file"", which according to the document includes more than 160 people in the Gaza Strip, it is written that Hamas has 1,115,495 subscribers on social networks, in addition to posting in eighty open groups with more than 24 million followers. The team, according to the document, deleted hundreds of publications, accounts and pages of the movement's opponents, including ""demolishing publications and platforms of the occupation"".

According to Palestinian sources, Hamas knew the true results and delivered fake results to Shakaki for more than a year. It also appears that Shakaki himself has no direct connection to the forgeries. The purpose of the polls is to glorify the public status of Hamas, deepen the rift in Fatah and glorify Sinwar.

Those around Shakaki said in response to the documents revealed by the IDF that if it was indeed a forgery - he and his team could not know if it actually happened in reality. They also said around the surveyor that his teams in Gaza do not belong politically to any faction, and that he trusts them.

Please joint me In a heartfelt prayer, this seeks divine intervention for peace in Israel and Palestine amidst ongoing conflict. They ask for healing of divisions, wisdom for leaders, strength for the suffering, and comfort for the grieving. The prayer emphasizes the need for unity, hope, and reconciliation, urging communities to build bridges of peace and calling for God's love and compassion to guide all affected by violence.

Dear brothers and sisters, Today, we gather to reflect on the profound yearning for peace in the lands of Israel and Palestine, a region steeped in history, faith, and conflict. For generations, countless lives have been affected by the strife that has divided communities and shattered hopes. Yet, amidst the turmoil, there exists an unwavering spirit of resilience and a deep desire for harmony. In the face of adversity, we must remember that peace is not merely the absence of conflict, but the presence of justice and understanding. It calls us to open our hearts to one another, to listen to the stories of our neighbors, and to seek common ground built on compassion. Each one of us has a role to play in fostering dialogue and advocating for a future where children can grow up without fear, where families can thrive, and where every individual can pursue their dreams. Let us pray for wisdom, courage, and compassion as we work together to build bridges of understanding and cultivate the seeds of peace in this sacred land. May we stand united in our commitment to a brighter future, where love triumphs over hate, and healing replaces division. Amen.

1f3cxkb,The Lebanese Diaspora,2024-08-28 15:21:04,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f3cxkb/the_lebanese_diaspora/,"There are around three times as many Lebanese people living outside of Lebanon than inside of it, a fact which has been true in one form or another throughout recorded history.

The Phoenicians (the ancient people of Lebanon, from whom most Lebanese are primarily genetically descended) formed massive diasporic communities that endured, politically intact, for almost a thousand years, maintaining close linguistic, cultural, economic and religious ties to their 'parent' cities (e.g., Tyre and Byblos) through to the Roman era. Although Phoenicia had long-since lost political independence, as had its diasporic communities, they remained flourishingly intact across the Roman Empire; the emperors of the Severan dynasty were Phoenician, and the seminal roman jurists Papinian and Ulpian were Phoenician.

Following the splitting of the Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity, the focus of the Lebanese diaspora shifted eastward, spreading their uniquely Lebanese variant of Christianity (following the teachings of Saint Maron) across modern-day Syria. Following the Arab conquest, the indigenous ethnic Lebanese community remained as the majority in Lebanon through at least the 12th century, and maintained distinct diasporic communities across the eastern Mediterranean (particularly in Cyprus, Anatolia, and the Balkans ... but also smaller communities in Italy and France).

Following the process of Arabization (which became much more pronounced following the crusades), a large portion of the indigenous Lebanese population adopted Arabic language and culture and the Islamic religion, while a minority maintained their Lbanese Christian ethnic identity and their original Aramaic language as a liturgical (and often, literary and conversational) language.

Facing persecution by the Islamic majority, and with an existing diasporic community in the Christian and non-Arabic world, these Maronites naturally had friendly relations with Christian (and later, with European) nations. As these nations expanded, overseas opportunities for Maronites increased, establishing new (and larger) diasporic communities across Europe and (to a greater extent) European colonies in the Americas in the 19th century. These diasporic communities maintained a strongly Lebanese identity, formed mutual aid associations, sending money home, provided support for independence movements, and (during the first half of the 20th century particularly) often purchased land in Lebanon and immigrated to their homeland.

Following the fall of the Ottoman Empire (which had adopted a markedly anti-Maronite position in the leadup to the first World War), the Maronite community successfully lobbied the French to carve out a 'Phoenician' territory from their broader 'Syrian' mandate, arguing that the Maronite identity was the 'Lebanese' identity, the successors to the ancient Phoenician culture, and deserving of separate self determination from the Arabs of Syria. The French agreed, establishing Lebanon as a separate state from Syria.

Now, if we step back, I want to make some points and pose some questions:

**Parallels:**

* Phoenicians / Lebanese Christians / speakers of Aramaic have not been a majority population in coastal Syria for 800 to a thousand years.
* However, they've been there the whole time, and their ethnic identity does connect continuously to the Phoenicians.
* The Syrian majority (and Arabs inside of modern-day Lebanon) did *not* support carving Lebanon out as an independent state; given the opportunity to vote, they'd have been part of Syria.
* The establishment of Lebanon was certainly due to the intervention of Europeans, who were sympathetic to the Maronite cause and to their claim to represent a uniquely 'Lebanese' ethnic identity.
* If you identify as Lebanese, there's about a 3/4 chance that you're Maronite -- but also, around a 3/4 chance that you don't live in Lebanon, and that your grandparents weren't born in Lebanon ... most likely, you live in the Americas.
* Of Lebanon's pre-independence population of \~1.2 million, around 53% were Christian -- with at least 160,000 (or 13%, overwhelmingly Christians) having immigrated within the previous 10 years -- and an additional 12.7% being members of the diasporic community counted toward each community's allocated seats in the government (83% of whom were Christian). The net result is that around 46% of the Christians making up that 53% majority were either recent immigrants, or not residents at all.

**Questions:** 

* It's often argued that Israel was only formed due to European intervention, and that it was unfair for a majority-Jewish state to be carved out of Palestine over the objections of the Arabs, who formed the majority. What makes Lebanon similar or different?
* The Maronites have lost their demographic majority in Lebanon, and subsequently their political majority; life is unequivocally worse for them now, when living in Lebanon, than it was when they maintained that majority. Should Israeli Jews consider this a parallel to what might happen to them in a 'one state' solution? Why or why not?

**Common rebuttals:**

* *The Maronite population that drove for an independent state was primarily already living in Lebanon, and had been since time immemorial, when the Lebanese state was created -- whereas a large portion of the Jews living in Palestine had immigrated (or their families had immigrated within the previous couple of generations).* My response: Palestine has had a substantial Jewish minority for 1,500 years, and its Jewish community overwhelmingly supported an independent, majority Jewish state; there was no 'immigrant vs. native' divide. Similarly, in Lebanon the native Christians welcomed additional Christian coreligionists ... and, like the Jews in Palestine, relied on them for a demographic majority in their section of the partition.
* *The Lebanese are Arabs, so it's different.* Many Maronites do identify as Arabs, and most speak Arabic -- but I'm not sure how that matters. If 'Arab' were the primary identity, why partition Lebanon from Syria in the first place?"
1f3cdm6,Israel's actions in the West Bank prove the apartheid accusation.,2024-08-28 14:59:14,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f3cdm6/israels_actions_in_the_west_bank_prove_the/,"Israel is currently conducting large-scale military operations in internationally-recognized Palestinian territory in the West Bank. The Israeli government has confirmed operations in Jenin and Tulkarem, both of which are within the territory defined as Area A according to Oslo II, where the Palestinian Authority has *de jure* authority over civil administration and security issues. The fact that Israel so regularly conducts military operations in the West Bank, which the Palestinian Authority has no effective recourse to prevent or protest, demonstrates that Israel maintains sovereignty, in practice not by right, over the West Bank; therefore, the charge of Israeli apartheid against the Palestinian people is substantiated. 

For all intents and purposes, Israel is the *de facto* sovereign of the West Bank. The most fundamental aspect of sovereignty within the current international system is the *monopoly of violence.* That polity is sovereign over an area that may inflict violence on the inhabitants of said area without fear of recourse to a higher (or stronger) authority. If I walk outside and shoot my neighbor, the police will come and arrest me. If the police come and shoot my neighbor, the officer who pulled the trigger, depending on the circumstances, might be held accountable, or they might not be. If the president declares martial law, and soldiers come and shoot my neighbor, nothing short of revolution will hold them accountable. Sovereignty in fact comes from the ultimate authority over violence.

Israel has regularly demonstrated that it maintains this ultimate authority over violence in the West Bank. Israel has already announced it has killed several people claimed by the Israeli authorities to be militants, and to have detained several more. The survivors of those killed, and those detained, have no meaningful recourse to the Israeli authorities for relief. The United Nations has documented that Israel often detains Palestinians incommunicado; subjects Palestinian detainees to mistreatment; and detains Palestinians without formal charge. [Source](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/thematic-report-detention-gaza-31jul24/) Furthermore, AP reports that Israeli military forces operating in the West Bank during the current incursion are destroying civilian infrastructure, such as roads. [Source](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-08-28-2024-41d98ed3cda2ba4a783913b06fbdc7d1) Palestinians living in the West Bank are routinely deprived of their property, liberty, and lives by Israel, without any effective recourse to a higher authority. For all intents and purposes, Israel is the *de facto* sovereign of the West Bank.

The International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid defines apartheid, among other acts, to include denying members of one racial group the right to life or liberty, or to subject them to arbitrary arrest. [Source](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.10_International%20Convention%20on%20the%20Suppression%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Apartheid.pdf) Israel is sovereign over both the territory internationally recognized as Israel, and, in fact, over territory internationally recognized as Palestine. That Israel subjects the people in these two territories to differing political, legal, and security regimes, constitutes apartheid.

Palestinian poll shows a rise in Hamas support and close to 90% wanting US-backed Abbas to resign  https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-palestinians-opinion-poll-wartime-views-a0baade915619cd070b5393844bc4514

I am not even talking about general elections. I am talking about civil war like in 2007 in Gaza where more than 160 people were killed and over 700 people were wounded, but this time in the West Bank https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gaza_(2007). 

Some might argue what if IDF manages to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, wouldnt that mean Hamas will be severely weakened ? How would a weakened Hamas confront PLO in the West Bank ? Others also suggest that Hamas could not be defeated, at least not by bullets and bombs, hence the Hamas ideology could very well still survive, evolve, morph into another organization Hamas 2.0, a different Hamas branch (West Bank) with different leaders but same fervent ideology etc‚Ä¶ in time with the financing from the Ayatollah and support by the people, it could easily refill its ranks again and rebuild its forces. But this time, to overthrow PLO, takeover West Bank and consolidate its power in the West Bank, which will be alot more lucrative than the Gaza Strip, more people, more taxes, more donations, maybe even more legitimacy if Hamas can replace PLO at the United Nations representive for the State of Palestine.

The Battle of Gaza in 2007 between Hamas and PLO only lasted 6 days lol‚Ä¶ and Hamas won the battle, hence ruled Gaza ever since. There will probably be condemnation from UN, USA, Europe of any civil war in the West Bank, the usual speech, uphold international rule of law, encourage dialogue to resolve disputes peacefully, remind the parties to protect civilians etc‚Ä¶ but rest assured nobody is sending any boots on the ground to join any civil war, nor should they‚Ä¶nobody wants to die in a foreign conflict 6,000 miles away in a foreign land. So PLO will be on its own and if history is anything to judge PLO military capabilities, maybe this civil war between Hamas and PLO will be over in a week time like it did last time ? 

Of course, after Hamas consolidated its power in the West Bank, it will most likely go after Israel yet again, with so many Israeli settlements within striking distance. This time, there wont be a labyrinth of Hamas tunnels in the West Bank, I think the geological makeup of the West Bank is different and with IDF ever watchful eye, wont be that easy to construct a labyrinth of Hamas tunnels and it takes time constructing tunnels. 

I recalled in the past when Arafat was a militant leader, he too moved alot setting up PLO/ Fatah strongholds in Jordan, Algeria, Lebanon, etc‚Ä¶ At this moment, I think its unlikely that Israel will agree to any safe passage for Hamas fighters from Gaza to move and relocate to the West Bank, but that doesnt mean there arent already existing Hamas members active in the West Bank, who could take up the mantle. 

I didnt talk about Gaza, wanted this discussion to focus on the West Bank. 

Questions :

1. Could Hamas overthrow PLO and takeover the West Bank ?

2. What would that mean for Palestine if Hamas tookover the West Bank?

3. What should Israel do if anything ? 

4. What should Palestinians and Pro-Palestinian supporters do if anything ?

5. What should Jordan and the Arab world do if anything ?

He had been working in the southern community of Kibbutz Magen when it was attacked and was abducted by Hamas in the nearby community of Mivtahim.

He was found alive inside a tunnel by Israel's elite Shayetet 13 unit. He is said to be in good health and was brought to Soroka Hospital for further checkups.

The IDF has decided not to publish details of his rescue at this time and simply describes the operation as ""complex"".

104 hostages taken on Oct 7th remain in Gaza of which 34 have been confirmed dead by the IDF.

Just wanted to make it clear that I'm inclined to believe the claim, considering it's a quote from a commander, and given the circumstance that Hamas dresses up as civilians - it is certainly possible that something like this may happen. However, it also feels odd that one would admit this? The idea that an IDF commander would willingly go on the news and publicly state this is weird. Even Hamas was smarter than this; they outright denied that civilians were targeted on October 7. Thanks"
1f2dp1d,People from Palestine understanding the Jews and sympathizing with them,2024-08-27 10:30:21,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f2dp1d/people_from_palestine_understanding_the_jews_and/,"Over the past 1.5 months I‚Äôve been watching a few YouTube and WhatsApp videos to understand all of the nuances related to the conflict in the region. Some of my (former) friends keep sharing Telegram videos about the civilian casualties in Gaza due to the counter terrorism operations conducted to eradicate Hamas throughout Palestine. Even a couple of my Israeli colleagues were forwarding views of Ilan Pappe with Gideon Levy in a large group. But no one seems to understand that at the moment, the Jews are suffering.

Since this subreddit includes a mix of Israelis and people from Palestine, I have 13 questions to gauge and understand how much Palestinians sympathize with the Jews. Preferably Palestinians from Gaza can answer these questions, but answered by others from Palestine is ok as well. Even others who are pro-Palestine can comment or answer these, these questions are also open to those who support the Jews.



These are pretty simple yes/no questions:

1. Do you condemn the heinous and barbaric terroristic h0l0c0st attempt conducted by Hamas on the military installations around Gaza and civilian communities in the envelope on Oct 7th and do so without excuses such as referring to the past events or the subsequent counter terrorism operations that ensued?

2. Do you condemn the act of taking the IDF soldiers and numerous civilians as hostages, torturing and raping them, and starving them in tunnels.

3. Are you against all the red triangles videos showcasing attacks against tanks and IDF soldiers, which is delaying the war and elimination of Hamas. Instead Hamas should be asked to lay down arms and surrender.

4. Do you condemn the terrorist attacks taking placed against IDF and the civilian Jews living in Judea and Samaria?

5. Do you perceive the Hezbollah attacks on surveillance bases negatively, including the near destruction of Kiryat Shmona, displacement of the Jews, and recent attacks on ancient Jewish cities like Acre?

6. How do you perceive Iran launching drones and missiles (99.99% shot down thankfully) especially when they could have landed in your own towns and villages and do you condemn Iran‚Äôs continued provocations and would you push for an end to their nuclear program and the dismantlement of the Khomenei regime?

7. Do you feel bad for the Jews that have left the country? Some unverified reports say that half a million have left since October 7th due to safety issues and economic reasons as well.

8. Would you accept a deradicalization programme or re-education measures imposed on your population to curb hatred of the Jews and promote peace?

9. Do you find that attempts to internationalize the issue by going to the UN is unhelpful and undermine attempts to resolve all the issues and because of that do you condemn the recent ICJ rulings about Rafah, advisory opinion on the ‚Äúoccupation‚Äù, and past rulings as well related to the wall?

In addition, related to the specific core issues, would you support the following:

10. An undivided Jerusalem as the capital for the Jews and evacuation of areas in the East so that future Jews can return to their holy lands there?

11. The Israeli annexation of Jordan valley since it is needed direly for security purposes?

12. Acknowledging the transfer of all the major significant communities such as Modiin Illit, Ariel, Gush Etzion, Yitzhar, and Kiryat Arba to the Jews?

13. Permanent Israeli control of Philadelphia and Netzarim so as to prevent Hamas or any other group from re-arming?



If the answer from Palestinians is mostly ""Yes"" to all the questions, I believe there could be a potential pathway forward to instilling hope in diplomacy for the peace process. It would also make Israelis open to constructive dialogue, show several gestures for peace, and consider some compromises. 

Otherwise, if the answer is ""No"" to these questions, then it would be pretty much crystal clear for the whole civilized world to see who is the real impediment. It is then easy to realize that IDF would have no choice but to defend the Jews and continue crushing the resistance from Palestine. The later is obviously futile for Palestine, especially because the Jewish State has far superior sophisticated weapons. And most importantly, nukes. "

[https://www.noirnews.org/p/dhs-monitoring-pro-palestinian-protests-chicago](https://www.noirnews.org/p/dhs-monitoring-pro-palestinian-protests-chicago)

Greenberg Traurig, a law firm and tenant of 77 W. Wacker Dr. on Chicago‚Äôs downtown riverfront, is representing several victims of Hamas‚Äô October 7 attack in Israel, in a lawsuit alleging that two pro-Palestinian activist groups, American Muslims for Palestine and National Students for Justice in Palestine, are propagandists for Hamas.

The lawsuit worried the head of security at 77 W. Wacker Dr. that there could be demonstrations, or even ‚Äúterrorist acts‚Äù outside of the building. So he contacted DHS, who, without asking for clarification or garnering evidence of any threat of violence or criminal activity, tasked a CPIC counterterrorism team to monitor the protests.

The Department of Homeland Security and the Chicago Police Department did not comment when asked for clarification about what kind of monitoring the CPIC team performed. It‚Äôs possible DHS and CPD directly tracked individual members of American Muslims for Palestine, National Students for Justice in Palestine and other pro-Palestinian activist groups.

‚ÄúHistorically, a significant amount of counterterrorism has been directed at monitoring political speech,‚Äù said Chip Gibbons, Policy Director at the civil liberties nonprofit Defending Rights and Dissent. ‚ÄúAttacks on Palestinian speech and Palestinian organizing has been key to driving this revival of the McCarthyite project under the label of counterterrorism.‚Äù

Whatever your views on the conflict, I believe there is an argument that this is disturbing from a civil liberties perspective, as speech and assembly are protected in the United States under the First Amendment."

I would like to ask, what are the best books about this conflict you think one should read? 

Please preface the recommendation by mentioning if you lean pro-Israeli or pro-Palestinian! Thank you 

-> 

I have been recommended some books, such as, ‚ÄúIndustry of Lies‚Äù by Ben-Dror Yemeni. (I have not read it yet).

> Israel is not free from flaws. However, this book draws a clear distinction between legitimate criticism and the industry of lies that has emerged from two unlikely sources - the media and academia - undermining their reputation as bastions of truth and knowledge. Ben-Dror Yemini presents an in-depth analysis of the many inaccurate and malicious accusations leveled against Israel and refutes them one by one in this thought-provoking and well-researched volume that invites us to rethink the causes and consequences of the Israeli-Arab conflict.

The two I have read are by Mosab Hassan Yousef, the son of a Hamas co-founder turned spy for Israel, called, ‚ÄúThe Green Prince‚Äù and his most recent ‚ÄúFrom Hamas to America.‚Äù 

I‚Äôd like one that focuses more on the facts of the matter, history, and I prefer well-rounded books. But I‚Äôm fine with reading biased books as I like knowing all perspectives, but telling me if the book leans more to one side would be useful!!

I thought the Green Prince was incredible and provided me some insight into the Palestinian mindset growing up in the West Bank, but it was less focused on the details of wars etc as Mosab is only 44.

For example, a book focuses on the founding of Israel, the six-day war, Israel withdrawing from Gaza and the founding of Hamas would be very interesting to read

1f1pplt,Uncommitted Organizers‚Äô Strategy,2024-08-26 14:33:58,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f1pplt/uncommitted_organizers_strategy/," This post is more for people who support the Pro-Palestine movement in the US.  I‚Äôm curious about how the leaders of the ‚ÄúUncommitted Movement‚Äù at the DNC last week are being perceived among supporters of Palestine, since it‚Äôs been reported that they had an opportunity to meet face to face with VP Harris, and they declined that meeting and demanded to be allowed to speak on stage instead, despite being told that wasn‚Äôt happening.  I guess I‚Äôm curious about how people are feeling about this.  [Here‚Äôs the Mother Jones article where it was reported.](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/08/dnc-sit-in-palestine-uncommitted-movement/)

This article describes the strategies used at the DNC by the uncommitted delegates, and I really don‚Äôt understand how there could be any logical explanation for their choices.  They talked smack about the Democratic Party for three and a half weeks, they openly antagonized VP Harris repeatedly at her rallies, and then they *demanded* that she provide them with stage-time at the Democratic Party Cheerleading Event, despite the fact that they were literally calling themselves ‚Äúuncommitted‚Äù (aka not voting for Democrats) and openly talking about their distain for and disappointment in the Democratic Party.  It‚Äôs genuinely inconceivable that they *would* have been allowed on stage, given that behavior.  And it should be noted that none of the other speakers were there because they demanded a speaking slot.   They were *invited* by the campaign and asked to speak in a way that aligned with the campaign‚Äôs themes of messaging which in this case was not.

The entire purpose of an event like the DNC is to build the party up and unify the message. Why didn‚Äôt the leaders of the uncommitted movement try to pivot at all, when Harris became the nominee?  When the campaign became about joy, why did they not shift their messaging to reinforce the joy and hope that Palestinians could feel, if a ceasefire/embargo were achieved?  They did literally *nothing* that would actually induce the Democratic Party to want work with them, except for threatening to withhold votes.  But given the unexpectedly small number of people who actually turned up to protest all they‚Äôre doing is showing that the Democratic Party can win without their votes, which makes them even more irrelevant in terms of political power.  No matter how loud they are on social media.

The idea that a serious activist could refuse a meeting with the future President of the United States, and instead demand 3-4 minutes on stage, seems very telling to me. These kinds of policies, like an arms embargo, are decided in the White House.  They‚Äôre not decided by the number of people who retweet a video of a speech.

It‚Äôs beyond belief to me, that anyone who truly cares about the issue they‚Äôre processing to advocate on behalf of would decline a meeting with the person who is actually going to be making those decisions after the elections.  The only person who would make a choice like that is a cynical liar who is upset about being denied their chance to go viral in front of an audience of 30 million. 

So I think the leaders of this movement are cynical frauds who are just milking the war to feather their own nests.  Based on the way they‚Äôve behaved in the past month; it‚Äôs either that or else they are literally the most incompetent activists on the entire planet.  There‚Äôs no other explanation that logically explains their choices."
1f1oyao,What were your thoughts during the first week of the war towards both sides and what are your opinions towards them now?,2024-08-26 14:01:51,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f1oyao/what_were_your_thoughts_during_the_first_week_of/,"I‚Äôm writing this as someone who lives in Sderot, one of the areas still dealing with the aftermath of October 7th. I‚Äôve been following this subreddit closely since the war began, trying to learn as much as I can through here. Now that more than 10 months have passed, I‚Äôm really curious to hear your thoughts, views, and opinions on both sides regarding the first week of the war and how those views may have evolved over the past 10-11 months.

What were your thoughts on the Palestinian people, their governing bodies, and Hamas during the first week of the war? from October 7th till the 14th? How do you feel about them now? The same goes for Israel and its performance during those time periods. Have you completely shifted your opinion towards either side? Have you learned to see things from the other side‚Äôs perspective? Or have these months only reinforced your beliefs and views?

I'd also like to ask a question that might be a bit unorthodox, what do you think Hamas and their allies did **WRONG** during the 1st week. And the reverse question for Israel and their allies. What did Israel do **RIGHT** on the first week?

Personally, the first week was a genuine nightmare for me. I've had a mental breakdown because my pet dog wasn't with me, and was actually in a very small kibbutz that was very very close to the city. I was very scared for its life. In addition, 3 armed terrorists were seen at the entrance of my house, trying to get in. I luckily wasn't there during the time but it definitely changed me and my family as a whole. Am currently getting government aid for OCD that has been strengthen to an extent by the war.  
I think that Israel did a lot of things wrong in the first week. A genuine slap in the face, Hamas got us by such a surprise that if you told me that something like this would happen a week ago I'd laugh at you. I don't necessarily hate the concept of my country existing, now more than ever. But I feel like top people in the government made a horrible mistake and need to suffer consequences.

10 months later, I am kinda ""lost"". Is THIS what life's gonna be now for the foreseeable future for both sides? Just chucking ammunition at each-other till one ""dies"" or ""surrenders""? The hostage deal isn't going anywhere. Iran and Lebanon are unrelenting. And no matter how many months we've been in Gaza it feels like we'll never get out. They always talk about ""the day after the end of the war"". But I don't see it coming any time soon. I can't fault my country for trying its best. But I feel like some things aren't going smoothly. At all...  
I can really feel some sort of empathy for the Palestinians. It is a very disgusting situation to be in and some didn't even ask for it. Situations like these make me feel relived that I don't live there, rather here. Or anywhere else for that matter..."

So, I'm going to share a summary of my understanding of some opposing viewpoints. I encourage anyone to share where you think I may be mistaken. Ultimately, though, I hope we can all see the humanity in each other, recognize that this is not easy, and that we are trying. Most of us are nowhere near the levers of power and would never in a million years harm another human unless we felt there was no other way for us to live safe, free, and/or dignified lives. Anyway, here goes:

**Those Who Identify with Israel:**

Hamas attacked on 10/7. Israel didn't want this war, and it is sad that so many innocent people are dying. However, Hamas deliberately put Israel in this position, and to solely place responsibility on Israel for the atrocities is manipulative.

  
**Those Who Identify with Palestine:**

Israel has been seizing Palestinian land for decades in ways the international community agrees are illegal, and yet no one has really done anything about it. Palestinians have tried peaceful protest (see, for example, The March of Return), yet Israel responds with violence, and things continue to get worse. Any time there is a flare-up of violence, Israel collectively punishes Palestinians and the casualty rate is vastly disproportional. Given all this and more, to say it started on 10/7 is manipulative.

I'm keeping it fairly brief so people can add their own ideas. However, I really hope that people's aim is to try and understand others, even if you don't agree. It is extremely hard to stay neutral in the face of so much violence. I realized this recently, that none of us are above the human tendency to adopt tribalism when we feel threatened. It's not that any particular viewpoint is defensible, but most are, from a certain perspective, understandable. Anyway, peace and love, however distant a dream that may seem."
1f1n2e3,Hezbollah's foiled attack on Tel Aviv was potentially disastrous...,2024-08-26 12:33:48,109,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f1n2e3/hezbollahs_foiled_attack_on_tel_aviv_was/,"""Make no mistake: Hezbollah's foiled attack on Tel Aviv was potentially disastrous... it would have been a mass casualty event. I believe this alone justifies a ground invasion of Lebanon.""
Hezbollah has a serious problem with that. Let me tell you quickly.

The ""low-intensity"" war between Hezbollah and Israel has been going on for almost 11 months now. This has played against Hezbollah, because during all this time, Israel has systematically attacked its entire logistical structure in southern Lebanon.

Israel has destroyed ANY NUMBER of bases, weapons depots and factories, barracks, and has eliminated hundreds of mid-ranking commanders (those who actually coordinate the troops on the battlefield).
Hezbollah has NEVER faced that situation.

In a war, THE FIRST THING you have to guarantee is your logistics. Your soldiers eat 3 times a day, they need water, and they need fuel to move around. And not to mention weapons and ammunition. If they don't have them, it's no use having an army of 100,000 Shiites.

Just like that, without many noticing, Israel was destroying PRECISELY THAT throughout the entire southern area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLebanon: the bases that would have guaranteed Hezbollah's logistics.
The Lebanese terrorist group is therefore in no position to wage a ground war.

Hezbollah also has no air force (or significant air defenses). Its only remaining resource for a war against Israel is its missiles.
It's no small feat, by the way.
It is estimated that it has 150,000 missiles, all of which are intended for use against Israel.

But, as I explained earlier, using them involves a problem: it requires a huge prior logistical deployment (again, the filthy logistics). And the Israeli intelligence services can detect that with relative ease.
In fact, that's what happened today.

Israel detected the movements for a massive attack, and acted in advance. Because it had located where these movements were being made, it destroyed 40 launch sites 15 minutes before Hezbollah launched its attack.

We do not know (and I do not think we will ever know) how many people died among Hezbollah troops as a result of the Israeli attack, but I do not think I am exaggerating if I imagine that it was something more or less definable at the level of a ""massacre.""

Now Hezbollah has had to resort to what it always does: rocket and drone fire against northern Israel, an attack for which Israeli defense systems are well prepared. The shots are being intercepted, and only three minor injuries are reported.

Of course, many Hezbollah rockets and drones are hitting Israel, because the defense systems do not shoot down missiles or drones that are going to fall in unpopulated territory. And a large number of communities in the area were evacuated long ago.

That is why the number of victims in Israel is minimal.
That's the difference: Israel thinks OF EVERYTHING, and prepares for the worst possible scenarios.
There has been much talk for years that Hezbollah was arming itself to the teeth.
Yes, but Israel too."

1. Do they run into the bomb shelter ? Do they even have bomb shelter ? Are they even permitted to run into a bomb shelter ? Thought they are suppose to rely 110% on Yahweh‚Äôs even for protection ? 

2. Since its Shabbat day, they are not allowed to use any electronic devices, no tv, no radio, no internet, no sms, no phone, no news, etc‚Ä¶ they wont have received any early warnings. Are there any exception Rabbi rullings ? 

3. So what exact do they do ? Do they just sit at their dinning table and pray, completely detached from the worldly matters, unconcerned as rockets falls from the sky ? Do they cower under the dinning table and pray ? 

4. There is no Iron Dome in the West Bank. Why doesnt Hezbollah target the illegal settlements in the West Bank ? Beitar Illit and Modi'in Illit are ultra orthodox jewish settlements, the largest settlements in the West Bank, illegal by international law and in the eyes of Palestinians. Nasrallah can issue a statement saying that punishment for expanding and encroaching on Palestinian land. How would the ultra orthodox jews react to an attack on Beitar Illit and Modi'in Illit ? 

5. Although he is not an ultra orthodox jews, just saying the infamous Ben Gvir also lives in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank.

1f13km6,Gaza war - blog update,2024-08-25 18:43:03,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f13km6/gaza_war_blog_update/,"I am from India and blog about current conflicts including the Gaza war. 

My latest post (link below), written today, looks at the predictions made in my previous post of 10 June and suggests what might happen next. 

I had posted that Israel will be in a position to start a ground operation against Hezbollah by the end of August. That would be the time operations in Gaza would largely be over with Hamas largely degraded and losing the ability to offer organized resistance. 

I estimate casualties for both sides -  in terms of irrecoverable losses and suggest that the exchange ratio, far from being an implausible 50:1 is a more credible 10:1. 

I argue that unlike 2006, Hezbollah is stuck in a battle of attrition it cannot win, nor can the Lebanese economy afford to continue confrontation with Israel. Iran and Hezbollah have no good choices. Hezbollah loses face by staying in place and by retreating behind the Litani river. 

I suggest it was not in Netanyahu's interest to negotiate a ceasefire agreement when he has the opportunity to resolve the Hamas ad Hezbollah threats and put a wo state solution on the backburner. Israel as done this so far by controlling escalation dominance.  

I analyze the Houthi threat and while it has resulted in a reduction of shipping through the Suez canal (which has hurt Egypt mor than Israel) the threat is overblown with only one ship sunk of the 82 vulnerable ships targeted by the Houthis, some by multiple cruise missiles. 

I believe a strong Hezbollah response will result in an Israeli ground operation to reach the Litani river to implement UN resolution 1701.

1f10wf1,"Anyone who says that the death count is ""disproportionate"" is implying that more Israelis should die",2024-08-25 16:50:39,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f10wf1/anyone_who_says_that_the_death_count_is/,"Of all the million arguments I've heard in the last year about why Israel should stop fighting back, the ""disproportionate"" argument is the most absurd and ridiculous thing I've heard in my entire life. The argument goes something like this:

""40,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, while less than 2,000 Israelis have been killed. How is that justifiable? It's unfair and disproportionate. Are Palestinian lives worth less?""

---

Israel is still under constant attack. There are hundreds of rockets being fired at Israel every single month from Palestine and Lebanon, and over 10,000 rockets have been fired at Israel from 6 different countries since 2023. The reason that the number of deaths in Israel has remained relatively low is because Israel has done an impressive job of shooting these hostile missiles down.

Israel has researched and developed multiple anti-missile systems. They have developed the Iron Dome, David's Sling, Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 anti-missile systems which are designed to track hostile rockets/missiles, and to fire an interceptor missile to shoot them down. Israel also has invested money to build bomb shelters in every single building for their people to take shelter when they come under rocket/missile bombardments. For many Israelis, this happens multiple times in a single day.

The fact that less than 2,000 Israelis have died is because Israel is **disproportionately good** at defending their civilians from foreign attacks. It's completely sick to use the ""40,000 dead Palestinians vs 2,000 dead Israelis"" statement as an argument to imply that Israelis are somehow bad people for ""having such a low amount of deaths"". 

There are so few Israeli deaths because Israeli society values their people's lives and defends their people well. **You are basically taking their biggest strength (valuing their own lives and defending their people) and twisting it into a way to paint them as evil (why are they killing so many Palestinians when so few Israelis are dying?)**

---

When anyone complains about the deaths being ""disproportionate"" without addressing the thousands of rockets/missiles that have been bombarding Israeli cities for the last year, they are essentially saying they want more Israelis to die:

>_There are too few Israeli deaths. Stop intercepting the rockets/missiles targeted at your country every week. Turn off your anti-missile systems. Let the thousands of rockets from Palestine blow up your cities. Don't run and hiding in bomb shelters. Let the thousands of rockets fired from Lebanon explode and kill your citizens. Let Yemen and Iran shoot missiles as they destroy your entire country. Only then more Israelis will die and the death count will be more proportional. I want more Israelis to die before I'm convinced that Israel is justified in their actions._"
1f0y2e1,What Palestine could have been!,2024-08-25 14:49:09,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f0y2e1/what_palestine_could_have_been/,"Oh dear Palestinians, do you need 100 years to realise and keep missing opportunities just to terrorise and attempt to drive out Jews from their homeland.

For me, this captures the whole essence of Israel: https://m.jpost.com/israel-news/article-788316. University of Haifa, wherein nearly half the students are Arab and study hand in hand with the Jews. On the contrary, do we see a single Jewish student at any university in Palestine or Lebanon or Syria or Jordan? Even in the University of Ariel, which the ‚Äúenlightened‚Äù EU seems to boycott, there are Arab students and even a mosque!

Imagine if you had accepted Trump‚Äôs Vision for Peace offer. So what if you lost a bit of land, Gaza would be a thriving industrial zone, way better than it is now. Jenin powerful plant could have been running full steam. Hundreds of thousands of Gazans would be working in Israel. Imagine how many more Palestinian students would be studying in Haifa, Tel Aviv, and the Hebrew University by now.

Imagine what Gaza would have been if you just focused on building it after the 2005 disengagement. You wouldn‚Äôt have to pay for any defence or military, you could have just focused on developing the greenhouses and other civilian infrastructure like the Japanese did and shown the world what you are capable of. Gazans would have been working in Israel and traveling to Jerusalem with ease by now.

Imagine if you had just taken the Barak offered deal in 2000. So what if it was 97% of West Bank and not 100! Palestine would have been a much more prosperous state with an airport in Gaza. University of Haifa and other ones in Israel would have so many students and faculty, considered ‚ÄúPalestinian universities‚Äù. I won't even bother getting into what Palestine could have been if the leaders just accepted the partition plan that gave them most of the fertile land.

Same goes to Lebanon, you folks have no territorial disputes with Israel and could open relations tomorrow and enjoy visiting Haifa, an hour away! Oh come on, Shebaa farms? Is that small strip of uninhabited land worth thousands of lives and a destroyed country? Half of your own politicians don‚Äôt think Shebaa farms is yours.

If Lebanon and Palestine made peace, the Levant could have been like the Schengen, a strong economic zone with people from all ethnicities coexisting and prospering. Instead, you threw it all away, the next generations shouldn‚Äôt never forgive you. 

Word of advice, dear Palestinians: The next time if Israel offers any deal, just take it, take it! Swallow your pride, take it. Lay down your arms, start working with the Jews who have always been open and continue to be in places like University of Haifa. Sit down, think of what the future can be if you stopped continuing on the path of attempted destruction of the Jews, that would help you swallow your pride. Dear Palestinians!"

**Anti-Israel Lawfare From the West?**

Are Israel's international legal challenges multiplying? 

US sanctions against Israeli citizens are now being challenged in American courts, while in Canada, the Jewish National Fund is appealing a decision to strip its charity of tax-exempt status. Meanwhile in the UK, civil servants are reportedly suspending arms export licensing for weapons sales to Israel; the government insists otherwise. 

What are the underlying facts of each story, their implications for Israel, and potential remedies? 

Join leading experts Professor Eugene Kontorovich, UK barrister Natasha Hausdorff, and Canadian litigator and foundation director Joanna Baron to discuss.

For context, my family lost everything during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, family members were killed during the initial invasion and we lost all of our land, houses, farms and everything we owned. We fled to the south and managed to get initially refuge in a barn which my family of over 20 people were assigned a single wooden table to sleep under/  to protect everyone. My whole family were displaced and and settled in the UK and Australia. To this day,  none of us have been able to go back to claim what was once ours, what my extended family had built up for generations and generations. Emotions still run deep, a lot of us still hold a strong hatred towards turkey but it remains at the resentment and anger stage, nothing more. My people don't commit terrorism against innocent occupiers in the north, we also don't fire thousands and thousands of rockets into our occupied land. We don't commit evil such as that or October the 7th and then celebrate it. 

Palestinians on the other hand seem to have a track record of committing violence against innocent Israeli civilians under the guise of ""resistance"". Not just on October the 7th where they butchered over 1000 innocent people at a festival, their constant decades long  barrage of unguided rockets into Israel has resulted in the need of the installation of the Israeli iron dome. This is not resistance, this is terrorism. If hamas or Palestinians want ""resistance"" then it should be against the IDF and the IDF alone. Killing innocent civilians like we all witnessed on October the 7th is terrorism and nothing more.

Ask yourself this, why do my people not commit evil acts against the occupied north? Why do my people not murder and butcher innocent civilians and call it ""resistance"" and then celebrate on mass in public. We have had our land occupied since 1974 yet we don't embrace terrorism as a form of revenge. What makes my people in Cyprus so peaceful compared to Palestinians who value ""resistance"" over anything else? Why do we have relative peace when we still have land that is currently occupied? Why don't we fire rockets into the occupied land in the thousands

I would like your thoughts on this. I fully believe the key difference between us is islam. Islam encourages all of the evil behaviour we are currently witnessing from the palestinian side. I have always wondered how different it would have been had me and my people grown up Muslim. I would imagine we would be seeing a more similar situation where terrorism and evil acts against the occupied north would be a daily occurrence. "
1f0fhof,"What led to the modern-day classification of Jewish people, ethnically speaking & why do Jews identify ethnically, rather than by their tribe? ",2024-08-24 21:00:15,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f0fhof/what_led_to_the_modernday_classification_of/,"I hope not to offend anybody with my questions; I am curious, because there has been so much war-fueled racial ignorance, disrespect and hatred following the social spread of information and misinformation regarding the conflict. A hatred that has affected ALL people, btw. Not only those in the middle east, but anybody with any opinion whatsoever on the conflict has been subject to this social war and hate.

1. **My question is what is the typical Jewish perspective of the non-Israeli Jews? Specifically, the Ethiopian or Egyptian ones?** I have met some \[black\] Egyptian Jews who have told me that when they go to Israel, they have problems with Israelis denying their Jewish lineage. Or, they always are asked to provide some long family history of their mother and maternal Jewish ancestry, the location of their ancestors, their family name, etc. I just want more understanding around the topic.

1. **My second question is, do modern-day Jews claim themselves to be part of a particular tribe? Are they able to trace this**? A lot of Asian and African ethno-religions identify with their tribes of over hundreds if not thousands of years. I have heard a very small number of people who identify as Jews identify with a particular tribe - they mostly identify with their ethnic name, as you had ""Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrahi..."" Do Israeli Jews have the ability to trace their lineage the way that people claim they should be able to? What about non-Israeli Jews - how do you trace your lineage?

1. **What is the typical modern-day Jew's relationship to the title of being of one of the 12 tribes as mentioned in ancient history?** Specifically regarding the cultural ignorance. I have heard a lot of people mention that most Jews in Israel are only converts, and are not true ethnic Jews. Some will bring up the lack of (perceived, bc IDK what really goes on in Israel) acceptance for non-European Jews, specifically the numerous population of Ethiopian or Egyptian Jews who have been identifying as Jewish for several hundred years.

1. **Why are Jews calling themselves by these ethnic titles, and what does that actually mean?** Is the lineage question even relevant to many Jews, or does the mother solidify all one needs to know to ""be"" a Jew?

1. **What do Palestinians think that they are (ethnically)? Do they legitimately think that they are not mixed with Jewish?** Are they aware that the Arabs forced taxes on non-converts, or otherwise killed them, making it very difficult to maintain any other culture outside of the Arabized one?

I do not wish to make this into a religious debate, but I want people who are not familiar to understand the extreme control that the Arab empire had over the whole of the Middle East and nearly all of Saharan and Northeast Africa. For nearly 800 years, (until around approx. 800 BCE), before the birth of Islam, Christianity and Judaism were the primary religions of much of North Africa. Despite the Roman Catholic authorities of Europe referring to the North African Christians and/or Jews as heretics, these Africans and Asians were able to form civilizations and grow as a people for hundreds of years, and resist the extremely violent acts of Rome. *(Please note that Rome had integrated into their laws extreme death penalties for heresy against the Roman Catholic church.* ***Rome burned entire European villages of non-Catholic Christians\*,\* throwing their children over cliffs\*****, destroying societies and burning down libraries to the extent that there is virtually NO trace of non-Catholic Christian groups of people in Europe, prior to the 1200s, no not the 1500s, there is evidence of non-Catholic Christians in Europe functioning as a society before the reformation time period.)\**

That is significant, because Rome classified the African and Asian Christians who rejected Catholicism as heretics. And despite their known punishment for heretics, these African Jews and Christians withstood Rome, and were able to thrive for hundreds of years, peacefully. Then, came Islam which integrated into Arab culture. And what Rome could not do, the Arab Empire did, and much worse. If Rome's punishment for heretics was that bad, just imagine how much worse the Arab punishment was, especially considering that so many African and Asian people now not only have no disparities (I have met some pretty resilient and passionate Kurds) against the Arabs, but they continue to uphold the Arabized standard of their own people. I would love to go into more detail, but my point is that the Arab colonization of Africa and the Middle East was worse than the Roman authorities, and it seems to have completed re-shaped the way that these people identify themselves.

**What do Palestinians (ethnically) think that they are? Why is the race of these two historically discriminated-against people groups become such a primary problem within this issue?** I imagine that the grand conversion of several Jews to Christianity following the birth of the Christian religion may have affected the way that Jewish people identify as a whole. I also heavily suspect that the forced conversions to Islam during the Arab Empire's \[what I would call\] reign of terror over much of Africa and Persia and Arabia, has also partially destroyed not only the history and the Jew's ability to identify themselves, but also their recognition of their roots. Palestinians who take blood tests show themselves to be VERY Jewish (ethnically), however Arab-colonized nations unfortunately are still dealing with the Arab version of mental colonization of their minds and identities, so they, along with many Africans only see themselves as Arab, and ethnically do not make room for the other ethnicities that they are mixed with."

This is so hypocritical! They claim to fight for humanity, yet pray for the exact opposite of it, and it just infuriates me. If you support life, you should support the innocents on BOTH SIDES. You should support PEACE, not just ""victory"" of one side and the annihilation of the other, that is literally the opposite of preaching life and humanity. And if the reason they think so is because they are against the Israeli government, then the same can be said about all the palestinians, as they are governed by Hamas who are literally a terrorist organization. And the same can also be said for  example about the Russians because of the war between Russia and Ukraine, but I don't see people calling for the death of all Russians just because of the acts their government carries.
And so it's just so hypocritical, and just proves how they are fighting for an agenda, not life and humanity. Because the innocents on BOTH SIDES are human!!! And they ALL deserve to live, in peace. So fight for that. Condemn Hamas and fight for peace!!!
You can hate the leaders, but don't hate the people just because of that.

Encampments were already generally illegal, but universities are now taking steps to more specifically target actions like replacing ""Zionist"" for ""Jew"".

For example, in [California you have the UC system and California state schools ](https://www.aol.com/news/zero-tolerance-uc-campuses-order-150541103.html)reacting accordingly:

>University of California President Michael V. Drake on Monday directed chancellors of all 10 campuses **to strictly enforce rules against encampments, protests that block pathways and masking that shields identities** amid sharp calls to stop policy violations during demonstrations such as those over the Israel-Hamas war that roiled universities in the spring. \[...\]

>Also Monday, California State University Chancellor Mildred A. Garc√≠a and 23 CSU campus leaders issued a systemwide statement about protests. **The university said campuses ""must maintain an environment where its work can be conducted without disruption.""**

>The letter linked to a [CSU website that listed ](https://www.calstate.edu/csu-system/transparency-accountability/Pages/tpm-faqs.aspx)banned activities, including ""camping, overnight demonstrations, or overnight loitering"" and ""unauthorized temporary or permanent structures, walls, barriers, barricades, furniture, or other objects."" The policy states, in part, that illegal activity includes ""vandalism, property damage, trespass, occupation of a building or facility, refusal to disperse in violation of the law"" and promoting or inciting violence or harm."" \[...\]

>State law bars wearing face coverings to conceal identity to avoid recognition while committing a crime, which will be incorporated into all campus rules. UC policy also bars masks worn to intimidate others. But masking to protect health, or worn during peaceful rallies and authorized protest gatherings, will be allowed, a UC official said.

Here is [NYU giving new guidance](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-community-standards/nyu-guidance-expectations-student-conduct.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawE0zLxleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHW1kEHNskMgdNaOtt8ZQloeNMx0sRCpmaFaZxvWVkpP2U4sgnVb1bpjnoA_aem_IJs807idgavQ2L5OABsMnw):

>Ostracism based on identity, such as refusing entry to an open event.

>Use or dissemination of tropes about protected groups.

>Actions taken against someone based on their field of study, course enrollment, or study abroad participation could provide evidence of discriminatory motive for NDAH purposes‚Äìfor example, vandalizing the office doors in a particular department tied to the study of a country or region.

>**Using code words, like ‚ÄúZionist,‚Äù does not eliminate the possibility that your speech violates the NDAH Policy.¬† For many Jewish people, Zionism is a part of their Jewish identity. ¬†Speech and conduct that would violate the NDAH if targeting Jewish or Israeli people can also violate the NDAH if directed toward Zionists. ¬†For example, excluding Zionists from an open event, calling for the death of Zionists, applying a ‚Äúno Zionist‚Äù litmus test for participation in any NYU activity, using or disseminating tropes, stereotypes, and conspiracies about Zionists (e.g., ‚ÄúZionists control the media‚Äù), demanding a person who is or is perceived to be Jewish or Israeli to state a position on Israel or Zionism, minimizing or denying the Holocaust, or invoking Holocaust imagery or symbols to harass or discriminate.** \[...\]

This is quite a shift from this past Spring when a lot of universities seemed rather permissible of encampments. Where universities had previously *negotiated* with encampments and hesitated to call the police on students, the current policy changes seem to be actively trying to prevent these encampments from popping up again.

There are a few reasons for this:

-Jews successfully winning [federal lawsuits](https://www.becketlaw.org/media/breaking-federal-court-orders-ucla-to-stop-helping-antisemitic-activists-target-jews/). Most people and organizations don't really want to take on the federal government.

-University presidents wanting to keep their job. Nobody wants to end up like Harvard, Columbia, and UPenn. These presidents often have hefty salaries, and it would be infuriating if these salaries were suddenly taken away by campus nutjobs.

-Anti-Israel encampments causing significant damage to reputation and property. Property takes time and money to repair, and degree value goes down when all employers see is students burning campuses to the ground.

-Everyone else who doesn't care about the conflict being caught in the crossfire. As much as everyone here has an opinion on the war, there are a lot of American students and professors who want to get through their jobs/studies and don't really care about the Middle East. As long as the war goes on, the anti-Israel campus jihadists will continue to be disruptive and this is simply not what students/professors signed up to do.

Stuff that I am personally ok with from these changes:

-Encampments, blocking free movement, physical intimidation, rioting, trespass, and vandalism are all against the law.  These violations should all have been reprimanded to begin with.

-Limiting use of amplified sound. Amplified sound becomes noise pollution when it actively interferes with studying and work.

Stuff that I am more ambiguous on:

-Limiting the dissemination of tropes and calls for genocide. While openly spreading harmful tropes and calling for genocide are both abhorrent, they are both technically constitutionally protected. I could really see anti-Israel folks aggressively using a ""no call for genocide"" rule against anybody who says that Hamas should be eradicated. Sometimes, saying ""Hamas shouldn't exist"" is somehow interpreted as ""war on Muslims"".

-Limiting downplay or minimization of the Holocaust. While also abhorrent and super offensive, this is also constitutionally protected. I subscribe to a ""pressure cooker"" model of free speech. If this sort of speech is suddenly not allowed, Jews will no longer be able to see that Holocaust minimization is a problem and will not be able to take proactive steps to address the problem through education and outreach. The alarming rise in Holocaust minimization should be a sign that somewhere along the way, the Holocaust was not being taught about as much.  Likewise, I could again see that anti-Israel activists use a ""no Holocaust minimization"" rule aggressively against people who dispute what happened during the Nakba, and universities giving into these anti-Israel demands for the sake of being equal.

-[Limiting the use of masks](https://reason.com/volokh/2024/08/16/are-laws-restricting-mask-wearing-in-public-constitutional/). A lot of anti-mask laws were designed to prevent the KKK from intimidating blacks, but are still subject to a ton of legal debate. It is true that anti-Israel activists and their Antifa allies are using masks with the intention to commit crimes and harass Jews in a similar fashion to how the KKK harassed blacks. However, as pointed out in the linked article, protestors can simply transition to religious coverings and suddenly universities might have a lawsuit about infringing religious freedom. These people already use COVID-19 masks outdoors and claim it is for ""health reasons"" anyway.  Anonymity as a principle can also help people espouse unpopular beliefs, and it can be difficult for officers to discern criminal intent anyway.

Well something that many moderate voice of Pro-Palestinian supporters often paint a very rossy picture of a future Palestinian state : democratic, secular, free, non-corrupt, respect human rights, etc‚Ä¶ lets just say an image of Michigan because I cant find a suitable Middle East country/city that represents that Utopian future Palestine state. Instead of expecting or forcing or hoping for Hamas or PLO to reform to be that Utopian future Palestine state that Palestinian people deserves, why not start a new political party which oozes democratic and secular values that we want to see ?

Example: when the Free Hong Kong protest started in Hong Kong 2019, some protesters advocating for democracy including young people started their own political parties and forge new alliances to challenge the political establishment. 

2. If Hamas and PLO are resisting democratic reforms ‚Ä¶. why arent the Palestinian people rising up just like in the Arab Spring to change their leadership (dictators, very corruption, non-democratic etc‚Ä¶) and elect leaders which can truly represent the Palestinian people. The authorities crackdown can be harsh, but that didnt stop the Egyptians, Tunisians, Libyans, etc‚Ä¶from rising up, making their voices hear during the Arab Spring. Yes, we can say, there has been set backs from the initial aspirations of the Arab Springs, it did change a few regimes, some changed back, things didnt change much, often just a different leader. But I think it was an awakening nonetheless. Nobody said change would be easy, at least they tried, and maybe they will try again‚Ä¶.but there isnt any loud protest against the Hamas or PLO by Palestinians or Pro-Palestinian supporters. Why not ? If the Arab people could rise up during the Arab Spring, why cant the same happen in Palestine ? 

Other example includes : Iranian people rose up to protest against the Islamic Republic during the Women, Life and Freedom protests.

3. Israel‚Äôs democracy isnt perfect, so are many other countries including the USA. Democracy are also being severely challenged around the world. However, I would like to point out when the Ukraine war started back in February 2022, the Prime Minister of Israel then was Naftalie Bennett. And after Bennett, it was briefly Yair Lapid, now the leader of opposition to Nethanyahu in the Knesset. I am saying, despite Nethanyahu‚Äôs age and what some media may be trying to protray, Nethanyahu wasnt the Prime Minister of Israel for 20 years continously, there were gaps, when other candidates from other political parties were prime minister. Even before Oct 7th, Israelis had been protesting and exercising their democratic right, more polarized and more difficult now given the current state of war.

1f01mun,Please criticise me on my viewpoints if you disagree.,2024-08-24 09:51:48,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f01mun/please_criticise_me_on_my_viewpoints_if_you/,"
I am pro Israel, but I disagree with many pro Israel viewpoints. 

Firstly, I think that it is unfair that Pro Israel people keep saying that ‚ÄúPalestinians do not want a state at all‚Äù 
‚ÄúThey only do not want to be part of a Jewish state‚Äù 
‚ÄúIf they had the opportunity to be part of an Arab state they would take it‚Äù 

If that really is the case, why did the Palestinian Leaders resist being part of Jordan. 

I also believe that although Israel may not have intentionally done so, Israel has crippled the economy of the Palestinian people.

I agree that Gaza has received billions of dollars of aid, and the Hamas leaders are really corrupt having become billionaires through usurping the aid. However, how could Gaza have ‚Äúbuilt Singapore‚Äù with the crippling blockade that Israel has placed on Gaza. I agree that Egypt has also placed Gaza on a blockade. However, no country or state can prosper without free international trade. The blockade, on Gaza makes imports to Gaza very expensive. Also Israel unfairly prevents ‚Äúanything that could potentially be used as weapons against Israel‚Äù. As a result, construction materials, and water pipes are not provided in Gaza. Gazans are economically isolated.

Gaza is not allowed to go out more than 6 miles into their sea space. THEY CANNOT EVEN ACCESS their own resources. 

I know that the blockade was placed after Hamas launched rockets against Israel, but this blockade has crippled Gaza. 

Please don‚Äôt get me started on the whole ‚ÄúOpen Air Prison‚Äù debate. Gazans have to pay shit tonnes of money for permits if they ever want to leave Gaza. They have No air space. 

The pro Israel comments on videos of Gaza before October 7th stating that Gaza is not suffering because of seeing happy people in malls and restaurants is really annoying. I agree it‚Äôs not an open air prison, and it is not a concentration camp. I think people who compare the suffering of Gazans to Jews in the holocaust are dumb, but Gaza was suffering immensely. Electricity shortages, people on food aid‚Ä¶ Israel must lift the blockade on Gaza."
1ezs3gl,"Do non-Arabs Have a ""Right to Resistance""",2024-08-24 00:14:44,139,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ezs3gl/do_nonarabs_have_a_right_to_resistance/,"This is a question for the pro-Palestinian members of this group. For the record, I don't believe in any so-called ""right of resistance"" which involves deliberately massacring innocent victims for any group. 

  
Having said that, in many Palestinian spaces, I see a lot of talk about how ""resistance"" which includes, suicide bombings, raping women, killing kids, even launching thousands of rockets at civilian areas (even at the Al-Aqsa mosque) and other such horrific, intentional actions, justified as legitimate resistance to occupation. And all this talk about how the occupied and oppressed have the right to resist against their oppressors. That is what I see being promoted and discussed.

  
So, my question to the pro-Palestinians is this an exclusively Arab right, that only applies to Arab Muslims or do others have this so-called ""right""?

For example, we see the widespread Arab occupation of African lands, for example in Libya, people who are descended from Arab and European colonialists and are NOT native Africans, are enslaving, raping, torturing and murdering MY people. My African people are being oppressed by Arab occupiers and invaders who are illegally and illegitimately occupying African land. You see the same thing in Sudan. You see Arabs occupying and oppressing and ethnically cleansing the actual owners, the natives of the land, Africans. Africans both Muslims and Christians are suffering under the oppression of these invaders, colonialists and occupiers. The group that carried out most of these crimes against humanity, the Arab Janjaweed militia, are close friends with Hamas by the way...

Let's take another example. Kurdistan. Turkey and various Arab countries are importing tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of Arab settlers to illegitimately settle in and occupy land which belongs to the Kurds. 

Those are just a few examples. I could give countless more.

So the million dollar question for the pro-Palestinains in this group, is the historical and current oppression, carried out by certain (not all or most) Arabs justify any sort of ""right of resistance."" Like should we as Africans start carrying out October 7th style attacks against random Arabs. Like Africans going into Jordan and killing over 1,000 random Jordanians simply because they are Arab and have the same ethnic background and some people who are doing things to us as present. And by the way, for the record, the oppression Africans face at the hands of Arabs is about 10X worse than anything Israel has EVER done. Or EVER been accused of doing.

If you support the Palestinian right of so-called ""resistance"" where little children are shot point blank, women are raped, people blow themselves up as suicide bombers and thousands of innocent people are massacred, do non Arab Muslims have this so-called right.

Should Africans carry out brutal terrorist attacks against random Arab people around the world, like certain Arab Muslims are carrying out against random Jews around the world? Should the fact that certain Muslims are committing crimes against certain Africans, call us as Africans to advocate the extermination of ALL Arabs around the world? Should Africans go into Dearborn Michigan and start shooting at random Arab people. LIke some random Arab family goes out of a mosque and some African starts throwing rocks at them in an attempt to injure them?

Should Kurds start attacking and even raping random Arab Muslim women? Should Kurds carry out terrorist attacks against random Turks and random Arabs?

Is all of this acceptable behavior in your book? In mine it isn't, but I am asking you the question.

Please don't respond and talk about Israel. I am asking a very specific question and I want a specific answer.

Supporting collective liberation feels more important now than ever if we want to see a better future for the people in this region. It has less to do with which side you believe is ""right"" and more to do with effective and productive work toward younger generations developing mutual understanding and trust across the deepest anger and hatred. 

If you're fighting for one side, like it or not you are fighting for both Sinwar/Hamas AND Bibi/Likud... division is exactly what they want and you are fanning the flame. So many people have lost hope that collaboration is possible... let's show them that hate is still not the only option.

On 8 June 2024, the Israeli military killed at least 276 people and injured over 698, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and Palestinian health officials, according to Hamas, several Israeli hostages were killed in the Israeli attack. The group stated in a video clip that three hostages were killed during the operation, including an American. during a hostage rescue operation in the UNRWA Nuseirat refugee camp. The operation's objective was to free 4 hostages taken during the 7 October attack on Israel.

Yes you read the title right, I rightly believe that funding for the criminal israeli regime should be put to a direct vote on the ballot. Rather than having a bunch of corrupt bought out politicians who take money from evil organizations like aipac and boeing, American citizens who have witnessed israeli war crimes even before oct 7 who have changed their mind on supporting israel should be allowed to vote on this issue.  Not only should they be allowed to vote on this issue, but they should also be allowed to vote on whether the us army should get involved in any future wars. A true democracy listens to the will of the people, not a group of corrupt politicians who are raking in bank over this war. 

2. Not only will this disprove the lie that a majority of americans support israel, but it will also get rid of the corrupt middleman aka the politicians bought out by aipac and boeing. Now I know what some of are you going to say. ""That would be disastrous for israel"", ""democracy is anti-semitic"", or we should ""help our greatest ally in the middle east"", which to you I have to ask is do you believe in the fundamental rule that started this country. ""no taxation without representation"" well this very well applies to the majority of the united states who dont want to send anymore weapons or money to israel. Taking away power from corrupt politicians is also a great thing, this not only applies to the issue of israel/palestine but also the issue of abortion, legalizing drugs, and etc.  "
1ezfrgc,Israel supporters are more pro-Palestinian than any anti-Zionist could ever be.,2024-08-23 15:33:13,99,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ezfrgc/israel_supporters_are_more_propalestinian_than/,"Hot take: Israel supporters are more pro-Palestinian than any anti-Zionist could ever be.

Contrary to popular believe, Israelis and their supporters don't actually wish any harm on Palestinians. If they felt there was a legit possibility for peace, we'd support and work towards it. We definitely don't want it at the countries expense, but we want freedom for the Palestinians together with peaceful co-existance. Since Palestinians evidently don't want it, however, this has caused indifference towards the the Palestinian cause, and the considering of the Palestine initiated violence, harm is inevitable occasionally. However, while there might be extremists, at the end of the day, this is not want we're asking for.

Anti-Zionists however, are making false promises to the Palestinians that they can achieve their maximum requests. They promise that Israel will fall, and that the Palestinians will be able to take all their land for the themselves. And yes, technically speaking, a county on earth is never permanent, but the anti-zionist narrative is that it's possible Israel will be gone within a lifetime. But it's not possible. There's absolutely no will from Israelis to dismantle the their state, Palestinians don't have the military strength, the BDS movement has no noticeable accomplishments..... and contrary to popular belief, most countries in the world and most of the world's citizens support Israel's existence (even if they don't neccesarily agree with its every action).

The bottom line Is: Palestinians aren't closer to Israel's destruction than they were previously, they're the furthest they've ever been. The previously mentioned points have only gotten more pronounced. Israel's military is the strongest it ever has been, and international acceptance has only grown with the Abraham accords. 

However, by giving this false hope to the Palestinians, anti-Zionists are essentially encouraging the Palestinians to live another 75 years as stateless people. Pro-Israelis might be asking them to compromise and accept Israel's existence. But at least they wouldn't be stateless anymore, and the bloodshed could subside. "

Another active examples of ongoing cases where people will get to walk even as we have actual rape caught on camera. 65+ percents of Israeli view these rapist in positive light, efforts to make rape a legal tactic was brought and attempted to be enshrined. These soldiers will be put in the shadows and their fate with not be addressed. Because israel doesn't hold themselves accountable to anybody. They don't even hold palestinian  accountable, they literally put them in kangaroo courts and throw the Key away and let people rot in jail and sexually assault people. 

This is a country that heroes are war criminals such as Yitzhak Rabin ordering soldiers to break palestine children arms. I can't tell you how many people I met Ben givir as an example that love Baruch Goldstein a man that literally walked in a mosque and shot whoever he saw. I've seen people who have posters of this guy in their house. It's insane and the list continues. Look at the tantura massacre not one single soldier was held accountable, infact the only person that was hurt was the professor that wrote on it.

Israel has no intention to cleaning up and holding themselves accountable, and the country is going to rot because of it. Again it's heading toward the Egypt, Iran route and doing it brazenly and unabashedly.

First I wanna start by saying thank you to
anybody who will give me a response to this question. It might seem stupid or unimportant, but it‚Äôs a question I truly want the answer to.

So clearly, I am jewish and when I went to Israel, I really enjoyed spending time with both jewish israelis and the arab israelis. I‚Äôve always been a huge advocate for peace and co-existence, and of course, my belief in it has died a lot since the October 7th massacre. I had a lot of anger towards palestinians but quickly realized that they were also suffering under Hamas. I continued to see videos of gazan civilians cursing Hamas and the leaders such as Sinwar and watching the state of how they live now breaks my heart too.

Ive been trying to find ways to support the palestinians while also not advocating for or supporting Hamas, Hezbollah, or the Houthis, but it seems that the majority of Pro Palestine movements are Pro Hamas which I disagree with heavily. 

I‚Äôve tried to find information of donation that directly goes to the civilians but there‚Äôs always some type of ‚Äúexposing‚Äù that the money isn‚Äôt really going to the civilians but is going elsewhere. I don‚Äôt want to contribute to that. 

In Israel is where I learned the most that the israelis don‚Äôt want war and that we should work to achieve co existence and peace with the ‚Äúopposite side.‚Äù I remember our tour guide making sure to let us know that the palestinian, arabs, or muslims are not our enemy and Hamas is.

I‚Äôve also been trying to find more information about the Palestinian viewpoint but it seems that a lot of it is either heavily censored or very pro hamas. A lot of the information i‚Äôm seeing isn‚Äôt even from palestinians/gazans directly. I would prefer unbias documents or information from the Israeli and Palestinian side

I guess in conclusion, does anybody have any channels, books, groups, donation links or etc? Where should I start? Any help is appreciated greatly!! Thank you so much! 

edit: didn‚Äôt think i had to say this but if you disagree with me, i am happy to hear your opinion but please do with respect and kindness! it would be really appreciated and help me hear and understand the various viewpoints people have. thanks! "
1ez1b4h,Question: Why is Egypt trying to get the removal of IDF control on the Gaza side by refusing to open the Rafah Crossing?,2024-08-23 02:12:17,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ez1b4h/question_why_is_egypt_trying_to_get_the_removal/,"The AP reported that Egypt is refusing to open the Rafah Passage for humanitarian aid if the IDF doesn‚Äôt release control of the Gaza side. In the article it states that an Egyptian official ""said Egypt told the United States and Israel that it won‚Äôt reopen the Rafah crossing into Gaza, a crucial entry point for humanitarian aid, without the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian side and from the Philadelphi corridor ‚Äî where Israel wants to prevent Hamas from replenishing its arsenal through smuggling tunnels. Israel‚Äôs defense minister says over 150 such tunnels have been destroyed.""

1. I dont understand why Egypt wants this. They also enforce the blockade which implies they are also concerned about weapons smuggling.
2. Accepting that Egypt is opposed to permanent control of Rafah because they see it as injustice, why would they not try to negotiate for removal of IDF control after the war being part of the ceasefire deal rather than removing control now in the middle of the war? They want the war to end and allowing Hamas to smuggle in weapons and I assume they would want Hamas to be in a state of desperation to force them to negotiate.
3. Why use humanitarian aid as a bargaining chip? Why cut off Gaza‚Äôs nose to spite Israel‚Äôs face? It seems like they are telling Israel, ‚Äúdo this thing you don‚Äôt want to do, or else we will stop this thing from happening that we don‚Äôt think you care about all that much‚Äù. Are they maybe trying to make Israel look bad, like they aren‚Äôt serious about humanitarian aid?

Edit: Thank you for everyone that answered. It seems most commenters agree that the motivation Egypt has to keep Israeli soldiers away from the Gaza side of the border is allowing smuggling operations to continue. That still leaves me with question #3. Why try to get Israel to remove its soldiers by threatening aid for Gaza? Why not threaten something that hurts Israel to get Israel to do something, instead of hurting Gaza?"

So, I don't want to know the likelihood of this happening. Even if it's a 0% chance to you, I'd still like to know what you guys think should happen.

The scenario is this:

Hamas, under disguise, somehow enter Israel (for example, whatever way that disgusting suicide bomber entered). In the group, they have one big time commander, eight militants, and three wounded militants.

They take a small school hostage. The school is located in a neighborhood that contains about 550 people. There are about 20 residential houses surrounding the school, as well as a convenience store. There are 75 children that are anywhere from 5-10 years old and there are eight teachers. There are 6 classrooms; one militant goes to each, the other two, the wounded, and the commander set up in the gym, which is directly in then middle of the campus and set up shop there. They take two teachers and five children with them as human shields. They barricade the doors, shoot at IDF personnel who get too close, and begin treating wounded militants. They force the teachers to keep a look out or help with medical aid. They gather intelligence (in whatever way) about Israel. Essentially, they are doing everything a terrorist organization would do.

How should the IDF or the government of Israel respond to this crisis? 

I personally feel like they should respond using robots. I feel like those are so underutilized. For example, I was watching body cam footage of police apprehending two teenagers who killed their parents. At first, they sent in a little robot with wheels. It had live audio and video capabilities, as well as weapons/stun items. Being one of the most technologically advanced militaries in the world, who are backed by one of the biggest superpowers in the entire world (the U.S.), I feel there would be a plethora of ways for them to rescue those hostages and take out the militants. 

What do you guys think?

Thanks!"
1eysd7h,"Change My Mind: I am antizionist because I am Jewish, Zionists are zionist despite their (maybe) being Jewish",2024-08-22 19:34:08,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eysd7h/change_my_mind_i_am_antizionist_because_i_am/,"I want Jews around the world to understand the authentic Jewish perspective that wholeheartedly rejects Zionism. Too many Jews struggle with their faith because they've been misled by the insidious propaganda that Israel's actions are somehow ""Jewish"".  This lie has poisoned the well of Jewish identity, creating confusion and spiritual turmoil.

Let's be clear: **The State of Israel is not Jewish.** Its existence and actions directly contradict the teachings of the Torah and the principles of our faith. 

**Here's why, from the perspective of Torah Judaism:**

* **Exile is Divinely Decreed:**  Judaism teaches that we are currently in a period of exile, divinely ordained. This exile requires us to live as guests among non-Jewish nations and to rely on G-d, not political or military might, for protection.  Zionism, at its core, rejects this fundamental Jewish principle by striving for ""self-determination"" and establishing a state through force. As such Zionism is not a Jewish ideology, rather anti-Jewish.
* **The Torah Forbids a Jewish State:**  The creation of a Jewish state in our current era is unequivocally forbidden by Jewish law. This prohibition is rooted in the ""Three Oaths"" outlined in our sacred texts, which restrict us from rebelling against the nations, forcing our way back to the Land of Israel en masse, and provoking the nations. Zionism directly violates these oaths, again making it an anti-Jewish movement.
* **""Jewish"" Was Misappropriated:** Zionism intentionally hijacked the term ""Jewish"" to serve its own secular, nationalistic agenda. It attempts to redefine Judaism as an ethnicity or nationality, stripping it of its core religious meaning. True Jewish identity is inextricably linked to our covenant with G-d and our commitment to the Torah.
* **Zionism Harms Jews:**  The Zionist enterprise has tragically brought more suffering and bloodshed upon the Jewish people. It has shattered centuries of relatively peaceful coexistence with our neighbors in the region and fueled anti-Semitism worldwide. Its militaristic approach and ongoing oppression have made Jews worldwide targets, not safer.

**The true Jewish response to anti-Semitism is not nationalism or violence, but Tshiva, Tzdukeh, and Tefila - repentance, charity, and prayer.**  We must return to G-d and our Torah, not to weapons and a false sense of security.

**My challenge to you:**  If you truly believe that Zionism aligns with Judaism, show me the sources, the teachings, the pronouncements from our greatest rabbinic authorities that support this claim.  You won't find them because they don't exist.  The Torah is clear.  

Stand up for what is truly right and just. Stand up for your Judaism. Reject the lie of Zionism.

1eyo1eh,Why are Pro Israeli people so surprised that Israel has become a pariah? ,2024-08-22 16:39:36,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eyo1eh/why_are_pro_israeli_people_so_surprised_that/,"Hi everyone,

Pakistani American Muslim here. I have been pleasantly surprised at how much the support for Palestine continues to grow. 

One thing I've noticed from pro Israelis is the sheer SHOCK at pro Palestine support from Westerners.

My question is, why is that shocking? There are many details in the Israeli/Phillastine history that many Pro Israeli people consider irrelevant. But expecting the same from other's is strange, no?

For example-

- 1967 annexation of Gaza/West Bank being illegal, regardless of who started what. Annexation of territory through war has been illegal since post WWII, regardless of who the territory belonged to. 

You may think this is stupid and people shouldn't pay so much attention to it, but you can't expect third party folks to ignore that.


- Palestine as a national identity is recent, but that has nothing to do with Palestinians have Levantine origin. Genetic studies confirm this, along with Ahskanazi Jews being mostly Euro, and Ehtiopian Jews being mostly African. Majority of the illegal settlers are indeed Ashkenazi ( I know in Israel proper it's only about 1/3rd).

Again, you might consider irrelevant. But a big portion of justification for Israel is Jews being indigenous to Judea. Seeing that many Jews aren't, and Palestinians are indigenous as well, will indeed blow that apart for most people

- ""HaMaS is A TeRRor org"" And? The Israeli army formed with 3 Zionist terror orgs
merging together. You've relied, for too long, on blanket hatred of Arabs/Muslims, as well as blanket labelling of Muslims as terrorists, to understand that people consider the Israeli army a terror org. War crimes ( before Oct7th) count as terrorism? As does illegal settlement? This opinion has existed for a long time. It's amazing that r/Israel finds it surprising.

- Gaza has been considered occupied under international law, regardless of the disbanding of settlements. Pro Israelis love to assert that the settlements ""only existed for 37 years and don't anymore"", but you can't expect others to believe that. Israel controls imports and exports into Gaza. Pro Israelis claim Egypt started the 1967 war because of blocking the straits of Tehran, which stifled Israel's economy. So which one is it? Is disrupting economy a valid reason for war or not? Most people will believe that territory will be considered occupied, regardless of the presence of settlements.

Also, those settlements were
illegal to begin with. You don't get a gold star for the bare minimum. You ( pro Israelis) may think so, but nobody else is obligated to.

- Israel, has, objectively , much more funding and support than Hamas does. The US, UK, and Canada all support Israel. Anyone who understands how Imperialism works, and that there is no country on earth that can match the Might of the US, will take this to mean that Israel has SO MUCH MORE resources than Hamas. When one side has more power, they will naturally be viewed with more scrutiny. You can't prevent that.

Those are major ones off the top of my head.

The tide had been turning against Israel for a few years now. I think it's surprising to the Pro Israel crowd because they dismissed it as a loud minority/""chronically online"" people, instead of realizing most of Younger Millenials/Gen Z / anyone w better access to Google Scholar, etc has been against Israel for a while. You didn't pay attention.

Anyway. I'm not looking to convert anyone here. Just wondering why the shock. "

Here are my MANY issues with this policy:

1. I learn by asking short questions. The sub says that in theory these can be under 1500 characters. In practice you simply cannot post without reaching the 1500 characters threshold since your post is automatically removed. It doesn‚Äôt matter what flair is used, the post gets removed. I don‚Äôt want to have to personally contact the mods every time I want to ask a question. This is silly.
2. It does not encourage fully informed, well crafted posts, as is the stated goal. What is encourages is people posting their opinionated stream of consciousness instead of getting to their point in a streamlined manner.¬†
3. Because of (2), it does not encourage discussion whatsoever. I‚Äôm generally pro-Palestine (although the distinctions are a bit arbitrary). I am on this sub because I genuinely want to be better informed about the pro-Israeli perspective and challenge my own views. This is made unbelievably difficult by having to read through five million veiled insults before someone makes a point. A pro-Israeli post from yesterday literally starts with ‚ÄúThe selective outrage is truly absurd‚Äù. That person‚Äôs opinion could have been expressed in significantly less than 1500 words. I could say the same thing about 90% of the posts on this sub.
4. Reading through long posts takes significant cognitive load. By the time I finish reading someone‚Äôs opinion or (mostly rethorical) question my patience already runs thin (especially because of point 3). How can you then expect people to engage in calm, patient, open minded discussions in the comments? It‚Äôs already an unbelievably taxing topic to discuss. Why make it worse by forcing people to read long essays before they can engage in a discussion.



And so on and so forth. Please remove the threshold.¬†

Please help me think of ways to spread this chat app.



I‚Äôve been thinking a lot lately about how the only real way to make a difference in this conflict might be through actual communication. The kind of conversation where you strip away all the labels, all the politics, and just speak as human beings. It‚Äôs not about agreeing on everything or solving the conflict overnight, but about understanding each other a little better.

There‚Äôs so much history and pain on both sides. It feels impossible sometimes to bridge that gap. But when it‚Äôs anonymous‚Äîno names, no faces, just two people talking without the usual baggage‚Äîthere‚Äôs a chance to break down some of those walls. At the end of the day, we‚Äôre all just people. We all want similar things: safety, peace, a future for our kids.

The usual methods haven‚Äôt been getting us anywhere. Negotiations, ceasefires, protests, even war, have all been tried, and yet the cycle continues. War may be a short term solution but the long term conflict will not be solved. Something different is needed. Creating empathy and understanding, even in small amounts, could be a first step toward change. Seeing the other side as human beings with real feelings and struggles could lead to something better.

That‚Äôs why I created a chat application. It‚Äôs a small platform where people from both sides can come together, maybe to debate or argue, maybe just to get to know each other, it's your choice. An anonymous chat between two people. It won‚Äôt end the conflict, but it might be a step in the right direction. If it can help even a few people see things differently, then it‚Äôs worth it.

If you‚Äôre feeling curious or just tired of the way things are, give it a try. The person on the other side may not be so different after all.

Many of you are more knowledgeable than I am on the history and geopolitics, and I'd like to make clear it's not what I'm offering here, but a biased view through the eyes of a single person.

Adding an excerpt below in order to get this post over 1500 characters so it won't get auto-deleted.

  
The room shakes, and the sound of thunder that is not thunder at all penetrates through the closed window, through the blinds and heavy curtains. ‚ÄúGood, I saved you a siren in Tel Aviv,‚Äù Eliezer says.

‚ÄúHow do you know that was in Tel Aviv?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rare for a rocket to get further north than Herzliya, and if it was further down than Tel Aviv we wouldn‚Äôt hear it.‚Äù He opens his laptop, taps it three or four times (which implies the website was already open in the background) and nods. ‚ÄúYeah, north Tel Aviv.‚Äù He turns his computer chair back to Aaron.

‚ÄúYou see?‚Äù Aaron gestures towards the computer. ‚Äú*That‚Äôs*¬†the feeling I‚Äôm trying to get at.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou and me both. Somebody from work sent me an email. ‚ÄòHi, hope you‚Äôre alright, it‚Äôs so horrible what‚Äôs happening there,‚Äô all that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, Americans don‚Äôt really know what to say in this kind of situation.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs a French Jew. He knows what‚Äôs up, experienced a couple of rocket sirens when he was here, but he doesn‚Äôt know what to do now and I don‚Äôt know how to explain to him. Every once in a while, I run to the shelter, but compared to other people I‚Äôm in zero danger. I sit here, and suddenly I hear fighter planes‚Äînot one or two but a whole squadron‚Äîand I stop what I‚Äôm doing for a second, and think: There are people that are going to die in Gaza in ten minutes. People that in ten minutes will say goodbye to their children, or parents, or loved ones, people that are going to be buried under the wreckage and know that nobody‚Äôs coming to rescue them with the chaos that‚Äôs going on. That the thing they feared most finally happened. And then I go back to playing Heroes Three, because what else can I do? How do I tell him that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw a picture,‚Äù Aaron says. ‚ÄúOf a British journalist in some war zone around here. He‚Äôs on his belly on the broken floor, pressing his helmet to his head with both hands, the fear of death in his eyes, and when you look at him you really feel like death is going to come any second. Until you look behind him, and you see two Israeli border guard officers, standing normally and looking at one of their phones, and you know what expression they have?‚Äù

‚ÄúTired boredom?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Exactly. That‚Äôs what the feeling‚Äôs like here. But how dangerous is it, really? I need to figure out whether I should fly back to exile.‚Äù

‚ÄúListen, my young friend,‚Äù Eliezer says, ignoring the fact that Aaron is two years older than him. ‚ÄúThere are three levels of risk. If you‚Äôre in Israel in ordinary times, then it‚Äôs somewhat dangerous here, the most dangerous thing being the cars‚Äîthere isn‚Äôt any country in the European Union with such high per-capita mortality on the road. It‚Äôs of course less dangerous if you‚Äôre Ashkenazi in Tel Aviv, and more if you‚Äôre an Arab in Tira. Partly because of systematic neglect, and partly because Arabic drivers, especially young ones, tend to drive faster and not put on seat belts. The second level is when there are rockets falling, like when you last visited in May. It‚Äôs a little more dangerous, but still less so than just walking around the average US city. Last time, for instance, there were two direct hits in Ramat Gan. This time, even though the bombings are much less frequent, there were two hits on houses in Tel Aviv. And there‚Äôs a third situation, where Hezbollah[^(1)](https://aaronbenelli.com/2024/08/20/know-it-alls/#98d87c65-cfa1-4cf7-a06f-824a676f45c0)¬†join in the game. In that situation, everyone who actually wants to keep living, like you, needs to get out of here.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you, Eliezer? Why aren‚Äôt you getting out of here?‚Äù

He pulls the exact same face he did when Aaron asked about using his name. ‚ÄúMe? What do I care?‚Äù And changes the subject. Aaron lets him. If ignorance is bliss, what kind of suffering is the life of a person who knows so much?

1ey9dad,"Does pro-Palestinian activism save children's lives, or does it promote sacrificing them?",2024-08-22 03:27:00,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ey9dad/does_propalestinian_activism_save_childrens_lives/,"My question is meant to be purely about the relation of cause and effect regarding the issue of the war between Israel and Hamas.

I am fully aware that even naming the war presents enough grounds for a controversy of it's own.

What I would like to learn here is whether there are more people who think in a way that focuses primarily on the outcome that can reasonably be expected, than on the morality of their activism.

I myself am clearly biased, but I'm not seeking confirmation by throwing this question out here. This is a topic where I wish someone could prove that my assessment is wrong, as none of the outcomes I project are satisfactory, and none of the options in reach seem desirable.

  
To clarify the question: I am under the impression that the world wide pro-Palestinian activism is effectively worsening the situation of innocent children in Gaza. If I was fully convinced that Israel needs to back down, whether because it has no right to exist at all, or whether it illegally claims/controls/occupies too much territory, I could still not support any form of resistance that involves the sacrifice of Gazan children, no matter how much of the blame - if not all of it - goes to Israel. Even if I hated Israel, I still couldn't support ways of fighting the state of Israel that put Palestinian children in harm's way.

Does anyone reading my question have a conclusive theory of how public support for Palestine could avoid pushing Israel further into a perceived corner, which makes the murder of children as collateral damage inevitable?

Among many others, I already explored the argument that the perception by Israel of fighting for its very existence is fake. However, real or not, founded or not, faked or not, it wouldn't change the nature of Israels reaction. This argument doesn't seem to lead into a change of reality on the ground, only in moral perspective. Therefore it would be helpful if anyone brought forward reasonable arguments based on how the reality will be affected by pro-Palestinian activism: More murder, or less?

  
Thanks!"

For a Palestine Zero-State Solution, Jews are expelled from the land to Europe. If In effect what will the reactions of Europe and the world that used to recognize Israel be? 

2. Israel withdraws from West Bank after returning the Sinai to Egypt, Surely nothing goes wrong with this right? 

3. Hamas managed to meet up in the southern West Bank, taking the port of Eilat along with them, how will Israel and the world react? 

4.Israel didn't go to Gaza soon after Oct 7th but just continues glassing it anyways, could anything change in the end? 

5.Three state solution came into affect since 1948, are anyone satisfied with this? 

6. Arab League cut ties with Israel permanently, now what? 

Look one thing is clear they're all fictional what if scenarios they didn't meant to trigger or violate any sensitive individuals I'm doing this for a thought post so pls bear with me in this one

Also may people wanted demonize Israel as much as they can so they could have a fire palestine, and sometimes they also told to ""go back to Poland"" despite the fact post war antisemitism intensify under the Soviets, and also where should they go then after Israel takes the L? Western Countries have also Palestinians in them aswell and they are could  be a lot of problems soon enough, plus how can Palestine adapt and process Israeli tech, business and even foreign trade with nations that have tied to Israel? Many of these Individuals chant these slogans but they don't know what's behind their background and purpose of it and many kept on fighting to the bitter end, to the point that even Palestine is free, they feel in their heads not enough, they demonize Israel so much to the point that they became the very thing they destroyed, what would happen if Palestine was a state huh? Should Muslim countries recognize Israel now, should Western countries recognize Palestine now, so many questions at this point to even levels of insanity, one thing is clear I hope for quick, peaceful yet promising end to the conflict, and let Individuals tear down their extreme, violet, yet half passed ideologies and thinking and I pray, hope, and believe that both sides should renocile, normalize and even accept eachothers space like actually human beings

1ey57vs,Israel is a rogue state ,2024-08-22 00:06:54,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ey57vs/israel_is_a_rogue_state/,"I am going to make some claims that challenge the preeminent viewpoints I find on this topic, here.  I, maybe like you, was firmly rooted in a belief of Israel as presented to my American eyes and ears.  Through this conflict, I have gone from viewing Israel as a country championing western values in the middle east, worthy of our tax dollars, to understanding it for what it really is:  An ethno-supremacist colony intent on subverting the region through military means and against all humanitarian convention.

It is those people who founded it, who necessarily struck the first blow.  True compassion would have been for the Europeans who committed the atrocities, to deliver them some of *their* land.  In fact, this notion was debated before settling on Israel. So, this founding principle characterizes the start of an unjustified, slow-motion ethnic cleansing.  Empirically an apartheid state that seeks to create a Jewish majority by any means - and not the democracy with Western values I was sold.

This discrimination is a necessary component of Zionism - to displace people of their lives and land based on historical readings of holy texts and ancient history.  No example of western democracy's natural and property rights available to the native arabs.  Any agnostic observer can recall the United Nations voting record, where it is essentially the United States and Israel Vs the world.  The US vote has singularly protected Israel from binding resolutions that would undo their settler-colonial actions.  The PLO and PA proved fallible, but a deep understanding of the historical record reveals recurring poison pills were inserted into peace deals, with Hamas funded by Israel to undermine said authority of the more moderate- according to Norm Finkelstein.  Maintaining this violent status quo benefits Israel alone- see Noam Chomsky.

There exists in most people in Israel, a kind of supremacy - religiously and ethnically rooted, that rationalizes their aspirations.   If you listen to any interview of the locals, they speak about Arabs in those terms.  See Abby Martin's latest youtube upload.   I listen to Israelis speak of being gifted the land by God, and of course the tale of being the Chosen People.  That it manifests as an apartheid state, should come as no surprise.  Reminder that apartheid states are considered a crime against humanity under International Law.

And so the native peoples of that land are victims of a most public and barbaric settler-colonialist front.  One whose AI and air bombing campaigns recall ""A report on The Banality of Evil"" by Hannah Arendt.  Palestinians are now enduring the most vicious attacks (vicariously) from a world superpower, put simply for existing in a land someone else wants.

Anyone in the West who dare speak out and challenge the predominate pro-Israeli narrative, is de-platformed, jailed, or labeled anti-semitic/racist.  United States citizens are now having their rights curtailed because of overt critique of a foreign government.  As a believer in the sanctity of our Constitution, this alarms me greatly. ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble..""  .  There exists a bellicose ethno-favoritism, that it has metastasized and devoured our very own constitutional principles and priorities.  One needn't look further than the riotous applause the Israeli Prime Minister received for giving a political speech filled with egregious lies.  The Hague would like to see this man, but instead we received him in the People's House.

I am not here to defend Hamas, or any violence.  I condemn all violence.  Yet, the truth matters.  The truth is that, October 7th did not happen as we were told.  Two babies died as a result of that attack, and there is no evidence of the 40 (beheadings) as was reported.  Further, the sexual crimes claimed were not proven per Israeli reporting and a United Nations investigation.  The truth is many of the people reported as killed on that day, were killed by the IDF, as reported by Israeli journalists.  The truth is that, the media at the time worked overtime to push Israeli narratives, without first investigating claims.  This proved to benefit the pro-war campaign as it serves to dehumanize Hamas.

Israel seems to believe that what it says can lay cover for what it does.  The **most moral army in the world** would never use their enemy as human shields.  Would never knowingly bomb schools, hospitals, homes, journalists, aid workers, refugee encampments.   Would not trivialize their war crimes by posting them to social media.  Would not order the assassination of its own people for political gain.  Would not torture their political prisoners.  This is no longer a defensive campaign, they are making a military point on the lives of the destitute - Israel is establishing deterrence supremacy, International Law and geneva conventions be damned.  If this war is not collective punishment, I don't know what is.

**Israel has no formal treaty with the US**.  You would be hard pressed to present a geopolitical benefit of our alliance, other than vague ""intelligence"" operations.  In fact, one could easily argue that their intelligence has goaded us into conflict, against our national interest.  Benjamin Netanyahu stood before Congress and sold us on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.   Who will atone for this misdirection?  How can we ever progress if we cannot have an honest conversation about real world outcomes of this relationship?  What is the World to think when we put the interests of one state, ahead of the entirety of it?

I am neither Jewish, nor Christian, nor Arab.  Reddit will be proud to know, I have 4 year degree in Political Science/IA and in that way could claim expertise.  I do not.

I simply claim to feel for a people historically wronged, and my country which is being led down the primrose path.

""It's right there for all to see and it feels like something out of a science fiction film. This is the wall. From the other side, from inside this place, for instance, the Aida \[West Bank\] refugee camp in the district of Bethlehem, it doesn't feel like anything other than what it is: a prison."" -Anthony Bourdain, 2013 Parts Unknown CNN"
1ey4ajx,Issues with Zionism as Settler-Colonialism,2024-08-21 23:24:14,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ey4ajx/issues_with_zionism_as_settlercolonialism/,"Israel as settler-colonialism is a favorite argument for the more intellectual pro-Palestinians for a while, and has had a surge of mainstream popularity after Oct. 7th. It's a complex, sneaky argument, that's often misunderstood. But in my opinion, as a rational way of thinking about Israel, Zionism, and the Palestinians, it doesn't offer a lot of insight. I don't think it's used honestly for that goal, but just as a pro-Palestinian buzzword. And even as a political pro-Palestinian buzzword, it has obvious flaws.


# The basic argument of Zionism as settler-colonialism 

First of all, let's separate regular ""colonialism"" from ""settler-colonialism"". Colonialists want to conquer land, to exploit their resources, and send them back to the home country - the metropole. Settler-colonialists separate from the metropole, and want to create a new, separate society in the colonized land. In fact, the argument goes, settler colonialists don't really need a metropole at all. They just need to be a group of people, who moves to another country, and not to integrate into the existing society, but to create a new one.

Colonialists need the native population. They're their labor, or even their customers, that they need to exploit, to generate wealth for the metropole. Settler-colonialists don't have that motivation, and don't need the native population. So they have an inherent motivation to ""eliminate"" them. Which, the argument goes, is inherently a motivation for expulsion and genocide. 

The clever bit of this argument, at least in its purest form, is that it can also ignore the Jewish connection to the land. Since it defines ""colonizer"" and ""indigenous"" purely as ""the people who moved into this country"" and ""the people who were already there"", it simply doesn't matter that the colonizers have deep roots in the country. And the people who were already there, it doesn't matter if they were themselves colonists. 

Finally, supporters of this argument like to engage in quote mining of Zionist founding fathers. Who did, in fact, call themselves ""colonists"". Whether it's because they wanted to appeal to the actual colonial power, because they used a similarly ""narrow"" definition of colonialism, or, in the relatively rare case of Jabotinsky, because he actually liked to compare himself to the white settlers of the Americas, associate himself with the forces of Western progress, and downplay his ""Eastern"" origin.

As a side note, the West Bank settlers, despite their name, have strong ""colonial"", rather than ""settler-colonial"" elements. Their relationship with the Palestinians is an ""eliminationist"" one, but they don't want to create a society that's separate from Israel. They're Israelis, like the Pied Noirs were French. Either way, I feel it's a separate issue, so I won't be discussing it here.

# Why I don't think it's a great objective way of thinking about Israel and the Israeli/Palestinian conflict

Removing the ancient Jewish connection to the land might do away with an annoying problem in the anti-Zionist narrative, but it also removes a key component of Zionism. Which, in turn, makes it harder to understand Zionism, and its conflict with Palestinian nationalism. 

Two specific examples that come to mind:

1\. The Temple Mount and Al Aqsa. According to the Palestinians, this is the second-most important conflict with the Zionists. There's a reason why the Oct. 7th massacre was called the ""Al Aqsa flood"", and the 2nd Intifada was called the ""Al Aqsa intifada"". This goes back all the way to 1929, and the infamous Hebron massacre, that kicked off the violent Israeli-Palestinian conflict in earnest. The motive for that, was a conspiracy theory that the Jews are going to take over Al Aqsa and destroy it. This is still a powerful driver of this conflict, to this day.

And yet, this fundamentally cannot be explained using the usual ""settler-colonial"" prism. In every other case where Group A builds something on top of Group B's holiest place, and bars them from entry, Group A are the colonialists, and Group B are the indigenous peoples. This is exactly the opposite in our case. Al Aqsa was built by a conquering empire, on top of the ancient Jewish Temple Mount. The roles are reversed.

2.\ Archeology in settler-colonial states, doesn't really serve the settler-colonial interest. Since the artifacts you're going to find, if you're going to dig in Australia or America, are going to belong to native cultures, not the ones the settler-colonialists belong to. This is not the case in Israel. Where Archeology is seen as part of the Zionist project, and used to promote the Zionist narrative. And is generally viewed negatively by the Palestinians, who try to undermine it with various excuses. Because, in a similar reversion of the roles, you'll find Jewish artifacts, with writing in the ""colonizers'"" Hebrew language, well below any Arab, let alone Muslim or Palestinian ones.

On a more general note, it's much harder to understand Israeli culture through this prism. While settler-colonial cultures often adopt some elements of native culture, to bolster their legitimacy, they ultimately want to import their origin countries' culture, which they view as superior. There's some element of that in Zionism. They did believe in Western values, progress, science, democracy, socialism. But similar processes happened (albeit less successfully) within the Arab society as well. And the Jews didn't try to create a ""New Bialystok"" or ""New Odessa"". They tried to recreate their ancient indigenous polity, at least on a symbolic level. They reformed their ancient indigenous language. They changed their own names to ancient indigenous names. As I mentioned, they obsessed with archeology, ancient holy places, the ancient origins of themselves as a people. Even Jabotinsky, who occasionally downplayed his Eastern roots, still used an indigenous name, worked to revive the indigenous Hebrew language, wrote about his deep connection to his indigenous land in other occasions. In that sense, they're closer to romantic nationalists of the time, than settler-colonists of the time. Viewing it through a settler-colonial prism isn't that useful here.

Ultimately, this view explains the basic Zionist motivation towards the Palestinians, a natural outcome of them moving to a place that was already inhabited. Possibly *some* of their approach to land (not all, because it ignores the historical and religious aspects). 

# Why I think it's a disingenuous argument 

As I said, I'm not going into the academic side here, as I'm really not an expert on this - although I'd note that vilifying Israel seems to be a major motivation of the entire field, from its modern inception in the 1990's. I'd just like to note that your average Pro-Palestinian, that uses that argument, probably isn't being very honest about it.

The main highlight of this argument, is that it can ignore the Jewish connection to the Land of Israel, while still painting them as ""settler-colonialists"". But this isn't done because it gives us incredible insight, or just because of cool new buzzwords like ""elimination of the native"". The point is to associate Israel with colonialism, all while denying settler-colonialism is a type of colonialism. The point is to create a definition of ""colonizers"" that disregards the Jewish connection to the land as irrelevant, and then to use that definition to argue the Jews don't have a connection to the land. The point is to argue that it doesn't matter that the Jews aren't really like the white colonizers of the Americas, on a factual level - and then to argue they're exactly like white colonizers of America, and white Americans should use the destruction of Israel to cleanse their collective guilt.

It seems that pro-Palestinians want to use a super-narrow definition of ""settler-colonialism"", that ignores all the baggage it usually comes with, so it will apply it to the Zionists... and then apply all of that baggage anyway. The result is pure nonsense. For example, they occasionally like to paint the Palestinians as Native Americans, possible even elves or cavemen, with their ancient forms of wisdom, intuitive connection to the land, pre-modern views of land ownership and power. And Palestine, as some kind of an Australia-like terra nullius, ravaged by the invasive Zionist civilization. Or to argue that the indigenous Canaanite language of Hebrew is ""colonial"", and the Arabic versions of the Hebrew names of the cities in Israel, from ""Askalan"" to ""Bir Seb'a"" are the original, ""correct"" ones.

Ultimately, it's a political talking point, not as a useful way to understand Israel, or its conflict with the Palestinians.

# Why I think it's not a very strong pro-Palestinian argument

And on that front, I feel it's not as useful as they might think. For a few reasons:

1\. Settler-colonies, unlike the more standard colonial countries, have one annoying trait: they're here to last. Once you've defined something as ""Settler-colonial"" rather than ""Colonial"", you've already admitted that destroying this country would be nigh impossible. The only examples that came even close, were ultimately destroyed (or significantly reformed), because of their classic, extractive colonialist features. Algeria expelled all the Pied Noirs, and created an Arab ethnostate, because the Pied Noirs were ultimately not settler-colonists - they were French colonists, who didn't succeed in developing a truly separate identity (although they tried). And at the very least, had somewhere to flee to. Apartheid South Africa couldn't expel or exterminate the Black South Africans, or have a real ""two state solution"" with them, because it needed them for their labor - a colonial relation, not a settler-colonial one. Rhodesia is even more explicitly colonial, and could barely keep on to its white population, who mostly moved there to make money, and then move out. None of that applies to Israel. None of the truly settler-colonial states were ""decolonized"" in any meaningful way. Not only did the settlers remain, they and their culture remained in power.

By calling Israel a ""settler-colony"", pro-Palestinians want to say it's therefore inherently fragile and transient. But if you think about it even a little closely, it says the exact opposite.


2\. While it's true that settler-colonialists have an inherent interest in ethnically cleansing or committing genocide against the natives, this isn't the only solution. The Maoris in New Zealand had some conflict with the Europeans, but ultimately, they were assimilated into the settler-colonial state, without a major expulsion or genocide. And indeed, they were allowed to keep some of their cultural identity as well, with the settler-colonial state's support, without jeopardizing the settler-colonial enterprise.

Some would argue that even the end of Apartheid in South Africa doesn't represent the end of the settler-colonial state, but it reaching a more stable stage. The white South Africans weren't expelled, killed, forcefully assimilated into another culture, or even lost their acquired economic privileges. And the civic nation-state that was formed, at least in theory, would be their country just as much as the black South Africans (who, incidentally, weren't all truly indigenous either).

3\. The most important target of pro-Palestinian propaganda in general, are Americans. They're Israel's sponsor, they defend it diplomatically, militarily, economically. Cutting these ties is one of the most important goals of pro-Palestinian propaganda, if not the most important one. But the problem is, Americans are settler-colonialists. And not just settler-colonialists, but the most famous example of settler-colonialism. I just don't see how you can convince the American mainstream, that settler-colonies fundamentally have no right to exist or defend themselves. That it's legitimate to do anything to settler-colonialists like themselves, including the atrocities of Oct. 7th. 

As I mentioned earlier, they try to get around this, by painting this as a symbolic cleansing of their past sins, through punishing the Jews for their current ones. That it's too late to undo America, but it's not too late to undo Israel. But that approach is both a reincarnation of traditional antisemitic views, and factually untrue. Both for settler-colonies in general (see #1), and Israel in particular. They're at least 50 years too late.

4\. If we follow this narrow definition, that ignores the historical and religious connection to the land, the hardline Palestinian nationalist movement is ultimately settler-colonial as well. On a basic level, it wants millions of Palestinians who never set foot in Israel, to immigrate to Israel. It doesn't want to immigrate there to participate in the Zionist project, but to destroy the existing Jewish society there, and replace it with an Arab one. And its relation with the Israelis who already live in Israel, is very much a settler-colonial ""logic of elimination"". They're of no use to the Palestinians, and it's much better that they'd go away, some way or another.

So yes, it's a great ""placard strategy"". ""Settler-colonialist""! Certainly something that every left-leaning, justice-loving Westerner should oppose, right? But if you think a little about it, the ""settler-colonial"" argument means Israel is strong and is unlikely to be destroyed. That it's enough that the Israelis just feel a little guilty about being settler-colonialists as Americans do, and maybe give the Palestinians the same concessions the Americans gave the Native Americans. That the binational democratic solution, that Westerners might accent, might be a victory of settler-colonialism and Zionism, not its demise. And that the price they have to pay for this, is to denounce one of the most fundamental goals of the hardline Palestinian nationalist movement. The very people who're insist on describing Israel as ""settler-colonialist"" to begin with. I don't think it's that great of a deal."
1exznws,"Ami Ayalon, former head of Shin Bet calling for resistance and fight against occupation in Palestine",2024-08-21 20:10:51,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1exznws/ami_ayalon_former_head_of_shin_bet_calling_for/,"To preface, during the last few weeks, some important events have taken place in the media landscape of this war:

- Al Jazeera has been shut down in the Holy Land for its propaganda.

- Al Mayadeen declared a terrorist organization, so anyone in Palestine broadcasting for it, beware.

- Meta shuts down The Cradle which has been spewing lies.

- Notorious comedian Bassem Youssef taken off X, I even wonder why USA gave him citizenship.

- Richard Medhurst rightfully arrested at Heathrow for promoting terrorism.

Some say these are dark days for free speech, but I celebrate these steps and think the above few examples is crucial to safeguard the Jews from being slandered.



Another vile anti-semite is Mehdi Hasan, who is also a charismatic speaker and a passionate debater. Although I'm glad that he was thrown off MSNBC, he still has a channel called ""Zeteo"" (waiting for it to be taken down) on YouTube. He has also been producing a new film about IDF soldiers exposing themselves through genocidal statements and actions on TikTok and Telegram.



Anyway, I understand why these anti-semites portray the war in this way, but I don't get why Jews like the former Shin Bet head Ami Ayalon go on his platform and give him legitimacy. This interview was quite difficult to watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU. 

Ami says that he was born in Palestine he would fight and resist the occupation. What occupation? There is no occupation, Judea and Samaria is the homeland of Jews. I can't believe he hasn't learnt basic facts while serving as the head of Shin Bet or the ex-commander of the Navy. And what does he mean by ""resistance""? Terrorism? This is truly crazy to hear him suppor terrorism from Palestine.



At least towards the second half of the interview, Ami saves face, grows a spine and defends the war and some of the difficult operations the IDF has been conducting. Nevertheless, Mehdi is obsessed with pressing him about torture that the IDF and security forces have been conducting against detainees from Palestine. There isn't much evidence of it, and unlike the other barbaric armies in the middle-east like Assad's, IDF is way more civilized, moral, and doesn't really carry out much torture. 



Overall, interested to hear what everyone here thinks, but I am quite disappointing to see some of the Jews like Ami Ayalon go on such anti-semitic platforms. I hope when he returns home, he is interrogated by the Shin Bet ;)"
1exzn8a,Calmly explain the mental gymnastics req‚Äôd to navigate Iran > Hamas > Invade Israel > ‚Äòüáµüá∏ Genocide‚Äô?,2024-08-21 20:10:02,109,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1exzn8a/calmly_explain_the_mental_gymnastics_reqd_to/,"Set aside the spectacle, slogans, & sensationalism.  The current crisis in the Middle East is tragic & pulls at the heart strings of our very humanity.  In the ‚ÄòWest,‚Äô decades of identity politics, dumbing down the public, and a generation of people who are willfully ignorant have all contributed to a general public detached from reality, affixed to their phones, and all-too-ready to express outrage over anything & everything.  

Against that backdrop, we have an Iranian-funded proxy militia who invaded another sovereign country & started a war. For clarity, it‚Äôs worth noting that Iran‚Äôs goal is, ‚Äúdeath to Israel,‚Äù and ‚Äúdeath to America.‚Äù 
**Genocide** - *the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group* (src: Oxford Dictionary). 

‚ÄúDeath to Israel,‚Äù ‚ÄúFrom the River to the Sea,‚Äù - these are rallying cries for *genocide*.  They‚Äôve  repeatedly demonized the Jews. Example are too numerous to list, here are a few:
1. President Ahmadinejad‚Äôs threats to ‚Äúwipe Israel off the map,‚Äù prompted letters to the UN Security Council, US Sec of State & Int‚Äôl Criminal Court, re:  violation of Convention on **Genocide**.
2. Supreme Leader Khamenei - at ‚ÄúJerusalem Day‚Äù gathering 2012, called for unity ‚Äúto remove the Zionist black stain from human society.‚Äù - **Genocide**
3. Prior to that, Khamenei took inspiration from Hitler, stating there is ‚Äújustification to kill all the Jews and annihilate Israel, and Iran must take the helm."" - Direct quote, inciting **Genocide**
4. Mid-2010‚Äôs, senior Iranian officials classified Jews as nonhuman/ subhuman: ""bloodthirsty barbarians,"" ""filthy bacteria,"" ""wild beasts,"" ""cattle,"" ""cancer,"" ""filthiest criminals,"" ""a blot,"" ""a stain,"" ""wild dogs"" - Direct quotes - **racist**, **xenophobic**, **dehumanizing**
5. Pezeshkian, 2024, inaugurated with chants of ‚ÄúDeath to Israel‚Äù & ‚ÄúDeath to America‚Äù (src: Reuters) - **Genocide**

With a well established agenda of destroying Israel, destroying America, and eradicating the Jews - **Genocide** - Iran is too weak & disliked by their own regional neighbors to take direct action, they can‚Äôt survive the reprisal. So they fund regional militia groups that allow them to pursue their goals of **Genocide**, in particular:
1. Hamas (Palestine)
2. Islamic Jihad (Palestine)
3. Hezbollah (Lebanon)
4. Houthis (Yemen)
5. Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq (Iraq)
6. Kata'ib Hezbollah (Iraq)
7. Harakat al-Nujaba (Syria/ Iraq)

Iran has their Al-Quds branch coordinating the militias and reporting/taking direct orders from Khamenei. All of this is a campaign to carry out their goal of **Genocide**, while insulating Iranian territory from the conventional cost of blood at the expense of other countries‚Äô citizens, to whom they claim to be allies.  One terrorist state running multiple foreign terrorist regimes. 

Palestinians have demonstrated solidarity with Hamas, allowing Hamas to effectively rule them & do whatever they decide to. In March, support for Hamas among Palestinians had *grown*. In June, Palestinian support for Hamas had increased even further. (Src: Ramallah-based non-profit Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research). 

According to the Palestinian polls in June, ‚Äú*only seven percent of Gazans blamed Hamas for their suffering. Seventy-one percent of all Palestinians supported Hamas‚Äôs decision to attack Israel on October 7 ‚Äî up 14 points among Gazans and down 11 points among West Bank Palestinians compared to three months ago. Fifty-nine percent of all Palestinians thought Hamas should rule Gaza, and 70 percent were satisfied with the role Hamas has played during the war.*‚Äù

That‚Äôs reality. Millions of displaced people who were in support of Hamas, a terrorist organization funded by **Genocidal** Iran, coordinated by terrorists in IRGC & run by Al-Quds specialists under the direct blessing of Khamenei, have galvanized every day since the Oct 7, 2023 massacre inside Israel.  Hamas has approx. 40,000 fighters. Palestine has a population of over 5.5 million (src: World Population Review; and, U.N.).  Gaza has a population of approx. 2.23 million, the West Bank has approx. 3.2 million. 

If 5.5 Million people are content to be ruled by 40,000 terrorists, celebrate their acts of violence, yet deny any personal responsibility, align themselves with the world‚Äôs epicenter of hate, in service of their **Genocidal** agenda, and that terrorist regime starts a war by invading a sovereign country, killing thousands, raping men, women & children __*on video*__, what right does that group have to claim anyone aside from themselves is attempting **Genocide**?  And how is it that anyone, much less homosexual white people from America & Western Countries, can call any targeted form of conventional retaliation, ‚Äò*Genocide*‚Äô with a straight face? 

I‚Äôm sorry but did starting a war become *inconvenient*?  Not inconvenient enough to do anything about their leadership, regime, allies, plan forward. Just enough to pretend a few thousand deaths, while horrible, are somehow **Genocide** the likes of which exceed the *proven* Holocaust that they so ardently deny? 

Relative to their population, Israel endured 20x 9/11‚Äôs simultaneously - if the 9/11 victims had all been raped & tortured on video before being marched into the Twin Towers for execution.  So my questions for anyone who‚Äôs studied world history is at what point does a people need to be accountable for the way in which they‚Äôve decided to live? At what point are a people who have, even after an atrocity, expressed support for their leaders part of the terror machine?  At what point is a civil war better than a world war?  How does it fall upon the countries who are being targeted & victimized by Iran, Hamas & their so-called ‚ÄúAxis of Resistance‚Äù to supply humanitarian aid, prolonging the suffering & dragging out the eventual outcome?  Why is there a moral equivocation between terrorists invading another country, raping & killing for sport, destroying all they can, then crying about the *consequences*?  Gays got rights in America within the last 20 years‚Ä¶ maybe some of the LGTBQ-aggrieved should go to Gaza and protest in solidarity, see how well that works out? 

If a Nazi didn‚Äôt personally run a gas chamber, but loaded the Gypsys, Jews, Handicapped & Homosexuals onto the trains, are they exculpated from their role in the ensuing torture & death machines?  Should the allies have celebrated the virtuous Nazi‚Äôs who did everything but open the Zyklon B or operate an oven? 

Palestinians invaded another country, raped, murdered en mass, and memorialized the moment on film.  Palestinians continue to support the regime that did this. Palestinians continue to provide the perpetrators safe harbor. Palestinians, and Iranians, *planned* on exploiting Western liberals - the same people that they‚Äôd kill in an instant, if given the chance.  The strategy behind this attack *was the ensuing international dissent* that has emerged in the aftermath. 

The vast majority of the human race believes it‚Äôs unacceptable to do what Hamas did, but politically the first concern is patronizing the vocal minority who have no skin in the game or who have direct connections to the perpetrators, all of which have now recast themselves as the ‚Äòvictims‚Äô - of their own actions. 

Most of all, can someone explain how *conventional* retaliation from a terrorized country toward their invaders qualifies as *Genocide*?   Call it war. Call it a humanitarian crises.  I‚Äôve not heard one voice call for the extinction of the Muslim peoples calling for the extinction of the Jews.  Liberals won‚Äôt like this, but sometimes you reap what you sow in this life.  I don‚Äôt say this in a heartless manner, or in giving Israel a ‚Äúfree-pass.‚Äù  However, America lecturing anyone on how to respond to anything militarily is, in itself, a sad satirical irony.  If I‚Äôm middle class, but I identify as a billionaire, should AmEx issue me a Black Card?  It‚Äôs clear as day we‚Äôre headed for a catastrophe, because people who have lived through or witnessed a ‚Äògenocide,‚Äô they don‚Äôt use the word so lightly.  Now that we‚Äôre out of WW2 survivors, seems history is destined to repeat itself.  

So please, explain to me how terrorists in Iran openly promulgating **Genocide** against the Jews & Americans for decades have somehow orchestrated the ‚Äòactual‚Äô **Genocide** of their own militants at the hands of their preferred victims? 
While you‚Äôre at it, please explain why Western tax dollars are flying out the treasury doors to provide food/water/medicine for the displaced, and in turn the displaced are using the charity not to chart a different course but instead to *increase* their support for Hamas, spending borrowed time like it‚Äôs counterfeit at the expense of our economic & civil unrest.  

Parting thought: If those who start wars are permitted to endure war, doesn‚Äôt that establish the boundaries of acceptable behavior in a global order?  Should we keep treating the most sinister offenders to a reprieve on the consequences until things literally go nuclear?  Why haven‚Äôt i heard anyone exhorting Palestinians to get Palestine, their home, under control?  This entire conflict was engineered to be nothing more than a horrifying outburst giving way to the manipulation of common sense which would divide & castrate the international community.  

Thank you. "
1exzbgr,"If Hamas were to be dismantled, what does Israel hope will happen in the aftermath?",2024-08-21 19:56:46,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1exzbgr/if_hamas_were_to_be_dismantled_what_does_israel/,"One thing I am confused about is that Netanyahu is focused on dismantling Hamas entirely from all of Gaza. This is understandable. However, does Israel believe that the next government formulated in Gaza will be peace-loving and ready to sit down and drink tea with Israelis? Considering the amount of civilian deaths and life under occupation, I don‚Äôt see this happening.

Let‚Äôs say for argument sake, Palestinians form a government that is sick of being militarized and rejects the ideology of Hamas and goal of Israel‚Äôs destruction. Would the IDF entertain stopping its naval blockade of Gaza? Would they allow freedom of movement for Palestinians? Would they vacate the Philadelphi corridor and allow the exchange of trade with Egypt? Would they stop settlers from forcibly annexing land in the West Bank? 

I‚Äôm an American observer, and in my opinion if Israel destroys Hamas and seeks behavior change, Israel must be willing to change its behaviors as well.  Israel must understand that Palestinians need to feel as though their Israeli neighbors (currently occupiers) want them to succeed as a peaceful state and have the freedom to be autonomous without ANY Israeli control. The pathway to peace is not occupation and the current treatment of Palestinians. This will only breed hatred and more violence, whether that is Hamas or whoever takes Hamas‚Äô place. What does Israel expect?

If Israel were to lay out conditions that must be met in order to be good neighbors with Gaza and the West Bank, what would those conditions be? "
1exup2q,Why Can't We Be Friends?,2024-08-21 16:52:36,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1exup2q/why_cant_we_be_friends/,"One of the things I have noticed about the debate going on in regards to the morality of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict is the division and rifting there is going on in our home countries as a result.

While this debate is most relevant to the people who live in Israel and Palestine, we are spending quite a lot of energy debating this across the globe. Largely I'm noticing these turn into protests, and have on both sides become aggressive and hostile; even violent.

The question is why? Why are we so fueled with so much hatred for one another we're more or less going to war with each other over a conflict happening in the middle east, not the USA, Canada, Britain, India, South Africa and etc?

We've been stuck in this cycle for some time. Vaccinate, don't vaccinate, black lives matter, police lives matter, shoot Harambee, don't shoot Harambee; and it perpetuates to extremes that are effecting lives of people who are just trying to get through their day in peace.

Not everyone is offered this privilege to live in such peace with conflict on their front door. Whether it be being pummeled by rockets from Hamas or under fire from the IDF, holding on by a thread with support from allies in the Ukraine against a humongous super power like Russia. This is something I indeed recognize.

Why can't we come together peacefully to discuss these matters? Isn't it possible that going at each other's throats is only adding fuel to the fire of the conflict rather than encouraging sides to consider peace? Shouldn't we be role models to the world in our respective countries to encourage a resolution for Israel and Palestine, rather than just beating each other up because we haven't agreed on anything since 2012?

Perhaps I'm naive for thinking we can get along but I live in Canada and I'm seeing how a fairly peaceful and agreeable society has become hostile, intolerant and even racist. Whether that be with a rise in anti-islamic or anti-semitic sentiments, it's getting us no where here and no where there. This isn't doing anything but killing ourselves. Neither of this things is good.

So can we be ambassadors of peace by discussing things rationally between one another? Or are we doomed to be fueled by hatred and have to kill each other over this whole the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and laugh at us for killing ourselves off so they can maintain the status quo? Personally I'm just tired seeing us be so ugly to each other and attack each other over matters of opinion like it's a crusade. I think we can do better. So when will we start doing better? If we're such an elevated and enlightened society why don't we start acting like it?"
1exu3ru,Being a Zionist and Pro-Palestinian are not mutually exclusive ideas?,2024-08-21 16:29:06,130,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1exu3ru/being_a_zionist_and_propalestinian_are_not/,"I think there has been a bit of a false binary in the Israel-Palestinian discussion; the idea that you are either pro Zionist or pro-Palestinian.  I feel like this binary comes from a bit of a misunderstanding of what Zionism means.

Zionism is just the belief that Jews should have a state in the holy land, no more no less. While the idea of Zionism is against Palestinians having all of the holy land, it does not conflict with a Palestinian state existing in general

Zionists like me can even be very pro-Palestinian. I believe in a two-state solution with all the West Bank settlements being abandoned, and I want Gaza to be fully rebuilt after the war.

Zionism just wants a Jewish state to exist, it does not preclude anyone from fiercely criticizing the Israeli government. For example, Biden is a self-proclaimed Zionist, as are many Democrats, and yet they are also very critical of how Israel has handled the war and has often urged restraint.

While, yes, some Zionists are very anti-Palestinian, but that does not mean the movement as a whole is. Wanting a two-state solution that benefits both sides has been the position of most Western governments for decades, so it's a fairly common belief among these governments.

Neither the Jews nor the Palestinians are going anywhere as they both think of the land they own as theirs, and both are correct as they are both descendants of the ancient Jews. Abet, the Palestinians assimilated into Islamic Arabic culture and intermarried a bit more with the Arabs.

I don't see why recognizing that both sides have a calm to the same land and that both sides deserve peace and independence is considered to be betraying each side."
1exgeym,Who is providing the private sector aid COGAT says is now the Majority Source of Aid To Gaza?,2024-08-21 04:17:34,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1exgeym/who_is_providing_the_private_sector_aid_cogat/,"So, my first look at all this came from the Washington Post article about the shortage of food in Gaza: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2024/gaza-aid-truck-sea-airdrop/

The other day I realized the source of that data is the OCHA (https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-14-august-2024).  However, I only noticed and realized today that they haven't been able to track private sector trucks going into Gaza since the Rafah crossing was closed.  They say that they can't observe private sector cargo at the Kerem Shalom crossing, and as a result they stopped reporting private sector trucks.  My first question I guess is why can't they observe them at the Kerem Shalom crossing?  I know there's major major military control over a major part of the Israeli side of the border crossing, but is there some ambiguity in watching the trucks from an unrestricted region entering the restricted region?  Is there a safety issue (perhaps threats from protestors trying to stop the aid from going in)?

Also today, I decided to check up on the Ukraine offensive in Russia and I came upon that same source that also had a video discussing how 2 Columbia professors were claiming that their analysis of COGAT data (https://gaza-aid-data.gov.il/main/; https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/0841ef22-d1f5-43b1-acc1-97a054c9129d/page/UpluD) showed that enough food was entering Gaza, the earliest time they report this analysis being April 30th (https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/04/30/famine_in_gaza_its_food_supply_chain_may_be_broken_150856.html).  They say 250 trucks a day with 20 tons of food a day is sufficient to get every Gazan as many kgs of food as an average North American eats.  The OCHA says 500 trucks including fuel trucks entered Gaza every day before October 7th.  They also say in an earlier April 5th article (https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/04/05/the_data_show_israel_is_not_causing_a_gazan_famine_150751.html) that since 75% of the Greenhouses survived based off of February FAO-UNOSAT data (As of April 23rd, that's down to 66%, and most of the surviving ones as of that late April date were in Rafah and Khan Younis, and some in Deir Al-Balah
https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/37aab9ef-f6fe-403a-9ca4-275021af1fa0/content.  I have to wonder how many are still left now...), that it's sufficiently provides Gazans with enough fruits and vegetables on top of whatever trucks of food Israel was allowing into Gaza as of April 5th and April 30th.  I'm not sure how it's safe to do anything in Gaza, much less work in a Greenhouse (as evidenced by the loss of 15% of the remaining February greenhouses by April 23rd) or on whatever farm land is left (65% of cropland has been destroyed (https://unosat.org/static/unosat_filesystem/3905/FAO-PAL-009_UNOSAT_A3_Gaza_Strip_Agricultural_DA_July2017-2024.pdf), and even if it were safe, how that was supposed to provide you with a constant supply of fruits and vegetables (https://www.anera.org/stories/palestinian-greenhouse-farmers-cucumbers-eggplants-gaza/ for a list of crops)... I'm not sure all those can be arranged to flower and fruit all year around and can be sustained without daily attention).  

Oh and 60-70% of dairy producing livestock have been killed and 70% of the fishing fleet have been destroyed according to OCHA snapshot I linked to earlier which cites data from the sources I provided as well as https://fscluster.org/state-of-palestine , which says it was co-led by WFP and FAO, both UN organizations.


So, after those two articles were published, in early May, Israel took over the Rafah crossing and closed it, and opened up the Kerem Shalom crossing.  Up until then the COGAT data seemed to roughly match the OCHA data (https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1dhwjbl/according_to_official_israeli_source_the_un_is/), but as soon as OCHA stopped being able to monitor the private sector trucks with the opening of the Kerem Shalom crossing, the distribution of the source of the aid trucks began to change drastically. 

Whereas the majority of the trucks were from humanitarian aid organizations before May, starting in May, trucks labeled ""private sector"" increasingly brought in a larger portion of the aid, to the point where they've become the majority source of aid by July according to COGAT.  And as I stated earlier, OCHA can't track ""private sector"" trucks anymore, since the Rafah crossing was closed and the Kerem Shalom crossing was opened in early May.  In May, about 43% of humanitarian aid was classified as ""private sector,"" where as in April it was less than 5%.  In June, it went up to about 49%, and in July, it went up to 73%.  And when you look at the the data tables, Private Sector doesn't include WCK, or apparently aid from specific countries.  I thought it was maybe USAID, which I don't see in the first few pages of rows in the COGAT data, but then  I decided to download the data, and go back to June when aid came through the maritime route I did find USAID listed as its own thing there.

I think one of the reasons the aid trucks from humanitarian organizations has decreased is that the road from the Kerem Shalom crossing to the main Salah Ad Din Road hasn't been secure, especially since the Rafah offensive, where as the road directly meets the Rafah crossing, and when most of the Gazans were there, they were able to distribute the aid quickly.  See: https://www.npr.org/2024/07/15/nx-s1-5035998/gaza-israel-food-aid-piling-up-not-reaching-those-in-need  Additionally, the government (Hamas) police officers who used to escort the aid trucks kept getting targeted by Israel as being Hamas, so I think that source of security stopped.  You can see from (https://fscluster.org/state-of-palestine) that the number of Gazans reached in a month plummetted in June.

At the NPR link, it looks like they're unloading the trucks and putting them in other perhaps ""private sector"" trucks that go back and forth through Gaza...?  But then, what's the source of that aid?  We know the aid provided by the humanitarian aid organization sources has been going down since the Rafah invasion started.  USAID is listed separately at least by the maritime route.  Other countries also are listed separately.  So that's main question.  Who is private sector in the COGAT data?  You guys seem to be following this stuff pretty closely, so I figured maybe you guys might know.  That's why I'm posting it here.

But to touch on the Columbia analysis, since it prompted me to look into this more closely to see if I'd been misled or mistaken, the two professors in their article talked about Israel ramping up to 400 trucks of food every day in their articles.  But the COGAT data says that 4828 truck loads of food entered Gaza in April by the land route (4828/30 = 156 trucks per day).  Then in May, it was 5164 trucks by land and 124 trucks by Sea ((5164+124)/31 = 171 trucks per day).  In June, they had 4029 trucks by land and 307 trucks by sea ((4336/30 = 144 trucks per day), and in July, they had 4629 trucks by land, none reported by sea (4629/31 = 149 trucks per day).   So that's a far cry from the 250 those professors said was adequate, right?

They calculated the 250 trucks from saying that a truck carries 20 metric tons of food and that 250 trucks, led to 5000 metric tons of food, which was enough to be over the 2.3 KG/person Americans consume for each person in Gaza.  Even if I go by monthly weight of food that went into Gaza, the best month listed under COGAT, May, they said 117,091 metric tons of food went into Gaza, which is 3777 metric tons of food, quite a bit less than the 5000 metric tons of food they say Gaza needs.  And if you see that this has been ongoing for 10 months now, you can understand how nearly 500,000 Palestinians are projected to be in Phase 5 catastrophic levels of acute food shortage in September (based on June 25th projections), and nearly 750,000 will be in Phase 4 Emergency levels of Food insecurity (https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1157065/?iso3=PSE).  At the end of June, the IPC estimated that ~343,000 were already in Phase 5, and that 642,864 were in Phase 4.  This infographic seems to have more discussion of the model and the discussion that went into it and what sort of data went into it since they don't have physical access into Gaza (https://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_Gaza_Strip_Acute_Food_Insecurity_MaySept2024_Special_Snapshot.pdf), and if you want the full blown detailed work, see: 
https://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_Famine_Review_Committee_Report_Gaza_June2024.pdf

And I mention the IPC because in the same podcast, the guy mentioned a reported correction to the March projections and estimates from the organization, which predicted that in the worst case scenario, a famine would occur, stating that the amount of food coming in was increasing instead of decreasing (but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore) in that March to June period: https://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/documents/IPC_Famine_Review_Committee_Report_FEWS_NET_Gaza_4June2024.pdf

They say in that June 4th report: 

> From March through April 2024, several key aggravating and mitigating factors for food security changed, including in the Governorates of Gaza and North Gaza. The FRC concurs with FEWS NET on the direction of many of these changes, though for several key issues is unable to concur with FEWS NET‚Äôs conclusions on the magnitude of change that occurred by the end of April 2024. To address major gaps in publicly accessible evidence, including direct and indirect evidence for food consumption and livelihood change, nutritional status, and mortality, FEWS NET relied on multiple layers of assumptions and inference, beginning with food availability and access in northern Gaza and continuing through nutritional status and mortality. While the use of assumptions and inference is standard practice in IPC generally, the limitations of the available body of evidence and the extent of its convergence for northern Gaza in April leads to a very high level of uncertainty regarding the current food security and nutritional status of the population.


So they tried to adjust the modeling, and they still came out with the projections that I listed above.

Yet, these two professors on a podcast released on July 31st, months after the Rafah offensive, still say that enough food is going into Gaza, even after the Rafah offensive: https://honestreporting.ca/podcasts/how-the-data-from-the-ground-debunks-the-gaza-famine-lie-a-fireside-chat-with-columbia-university-professors-awi-federgruen-and-ran-kivetz/"
1exd4ha,Why does Hamas wants to negotiate a deal with Nethanyahu ?,2024-08-21 01:33:58,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1exd4ha/why_does_hamas_wants_to_negotiate_a_deal_with/,"I dont get it‚Ä¶something isnt adding up. Hear me out https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/20/hamas-biden-israel-gaza-blinken/

1. If Hamas is winning (however you want to define it ‚Ä¶.still surviving, still striking back at Israel albeit not a big retaliation even after their leader was killed‚Ä¶) why would Hamas wants to negotiate a deal if Hamas is winning ? If Hamas is winning, shouldnt it do the exact opposite and not want any deal. 

2. If Hamas really didnt care about the ordinary people of Gaza as has been widely reported in the media, more reason not to negotiate a deal with Nethanyahu. Why even bother ? Shouldnt Hamas has a stockpile of food, ammunitions to last them ? Yahya Sinwar is not going to starve. 

3. Hamas should already know what exactly Nethanyahu wants in all these secret negotiations they had. Why is Hamas even surprised that Nethanyahu is making and will make demands which may not be easy for Hamas to agree on or demands which may be disadvantageous to Hamas ? Is that so surprising ? In any negotiation, the one with the bigger negotiating power often dictates the term‚Ä¶. take it or leave it ? But why is Hamas coming to the negotiating table each time ? What does Hamas expect to get from a deal?

4. I cant imagine any party really pressuring Hamas to negotiate with Nethanyahu. USA pressuring Hamas ? What is US going to do if Hamas refuse to play along and go to the negotiating table ? Nothing. Iran pressuring Hamas ? Iran probably is encouraging Hamas to cause more havoc in the region. I cant imagine Iran telling Hamas‚Ä¶.hey you created this mess without our express permission, its your responsibility to sort out your own mess. Dont drag us (Iran) into your mess‚Ä¶ go make up with Nethanyahu or else‚Ä¶. Qatar pressuring Hamas (maybe),‚Ä¶even so‚Ä¶the Hamas leaders really in charge is in Gaza not in Doha ? Not like Qatar can kick out Yahya Sinwar ? Maybe freeze their assets/ money ? Might anger Hamas‚Ä¶. 

If nobody is really pressuring Hamas, does it mean Hamas really want a deal with Nethanyahu ? But why ? Are they losing ?

5. Hamas should already know that USA is no honest deal broker and is an ally to Israel. Why are they, Hamas even complaining about something that is already known. 

6. Call it whatever you want‚Ä¶.if Nethanyahu has the bargaining power and dictates the terms of any deal and if Hamas agrees to the deal. Is it a peace deal or a Hamas surrender deal ? Its all the same, just different name. Dont get me wrong, a peace deal is definitely good news for everyone especially the Gazan civilians, hostage family, etc‚Ä¶

7. As for Nethanyahu sending Israel delegation to negotiate each time‚Ä¶. I think that‚Äôs pressure from USA, her allies and Israeli protesters‚Ä¶. Nethanyahu wants to be ‚Äúseen‚Äù trying to negotiate a deal to appease US, ‚Äúdoing something‚Äù trying to negotiate the release of hostages to appease Israel public, ‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs a bit of a charade i think. I think Nethanyahu is under pressure to negotiate. But if he think Israel is winning this war, he will double down and go all in, and wants Sinwar dead.

1exbxin,What does your heart say?,2024-08-21 00:37:12,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1exbxin/what_does_your_heart_say/,"As a father of two sometimes it's really difficult to consume and bear witness to the vile atrocities of the IDF. But if you take away the fact that as Muslim And as someone who has been through persecution and their own home country I tend to side with the resistance, I always wonder what people on the other side feel when they see images of dead children. 

13 to 15,000 dead children and we bear witness to daily slaughter. Imagine it's hard for me because most of those kids look like my kids (just sleeping and covered in blood) 

But as a Zionist when you see an image of a mother holding her child unable to breathe, Or if the father whose newborns were killed with their mother (a doctor) in a targeted strike, are the countless motionless children being flung around from ambulance to hospital doors. What is your heart say? What do you feel?


I don't care if it was an airstrike that killed all the leaders of Hamas but also happened to kill 40 children. What do you feel when you see the 40 dead children? 

What do you feel when you see the videos of kids under the age of six crawling out through the rubble screaming from help? 

It just blows my mind that it doesn't phase people in this group. Are the alternate reality is your closing your eyes to it. 

I guess two pronged question, 1) If you do see those images what do you feel? Indifference, contempt, justice?
2) how much of the murder in death do you actually observe? Of the tens of thousands of civilians murdered by the IDF how many deaths have you born witness to? These are being funded by the US and perpetrated with agreement of the Israeli populace I imagine you must feel a responsibility?

Personally I have a really difficult time looking away because then I feel I'm not even bearing witness. And when I look at them I don't understand what I can do. All I can do is listen to good people like Katie Halper, Gabor Mate, and countless other Jews who stand against Zionism and use their platform. But it doesn't feel enough. I pray that one day when the war is over I can go help rebuild and take care of the children that have been made orphans by this murderous terrorist onslaught by the IDF and the far right Zionists regime.

1ex737m,"For LGBTQ supporters of Palestine, what will get you to change your mind and support Israel instead?",2024-08-20 21:08:10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ex737m/for_lgbtq_supporters_of_palestine_what_will_get/,"I know you've heard the Queers for Palestine is like Chickens for KFC joke a billion times, but there's a good point to it.

Most Palestinians are not supportive of your right to exist whereas Israel is. Gay marriage may not be legal in either country, but at least Israel still recognizes gay marriages done abroad. It's a weird law, I know, but hopefully one day Israel will cut the middle man and fully legalize gay marriage in their country. Trans rights are also superior in Israel as opposed to Palestine which has none and will treat you worse than poorly just as if you were a cisgender gay person.

If you're supportive of Israel's right to exist and defend itself but believe Palestine should as well, just understand that most Palestinians are not on board with you on that either. They want a one-state solution where Israel is completely eliminated, at least that's what Hamas' charter opens with: ""Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it just as it obliterated others before it."" If your goal is a two-state solution, you have to eliminate Hamas and other parties that want the other side gone.

If your reason for supporting Palestine is to stand with oppressed peoples, I get why you may be sympathetic to that, but if Palestine wins, more oppression will happen (especially to LGBT people). If you want the least oppression, consider supporting Israel where LGBT citizens' lives aren't perfect, but better than their Palestinian counterparts.

If your reason is you're against colonialism and imperialism, Israel is not a colonial state. The Jews have a historical right to live in that part of the world and at least the UN recognizes that. Due to years of oppression from all parts of the world, the Jews deserve a safe haven from antisemitism.

If your criticism of Israel is that they're ""pinkwashing"", understand that Israel's support of LGBT rights is genuine and you should acknowledge it. LGBT rights are advancing in Israel and Tel Aviv has one of the biggest pride events in the world attracting around 200,000+ attendees annually."

But the thing that they undeliberately or most likely deliberately fail to mention is that the majority of the children who are INTENTIONALLY killed(in war there are very sad cases of innocent children killed on either side but on this conflict far more on the Palestinian side sadly and i condemn it in every way) are in almost every case, if not every case either terrorists/hamas militants, it is crazy that i have to say this but sadly this is true as hamas is very infamous of recruiting teens and in many cases children as well to perform their attacks, for obvious reasons(children are very easily swayed, in most cases dont ask for money and when they are killed there would be 10X a harder reaction from the international community), many of these children stab, throw molotovs directly at police, mob attack and sometimes even shoot themselves(especially teens).  
Here is just 1 example of a very sad case in which these children were either sent by a group or performed it themselves, maybe unaware that most police and IDF soldiers have stab proof vests and have all the right in the world to defend themselves just like any other police in any other nation would.

Now i do not claim that there arent cases in which there is indiscriminate or intentional killings and these have to be condemnded and punished by the full force of the law obviously, but i made this post to inform that the far majority of children who are INTENTIONALLY killed are killed in self defense, information which is really lacking by the pro palestinian and even pro israeli side.

May we pray for peace and better times Amen no human should EVER be killed no matter what ""side"" they are on.

\*\*EDIT: Seeing as \*\*i cant comment\*\*(dont ask me questions i cant respond...), i wanted to clarify that i ALWAYS condemn the innocent killing of children on either side, and as i stated in my post any soldier/police officer who acts in such a despicable way has to be punished by the full force of the law, but many of you commented things which had nothing to do with the post such as saying that i condemn the killings of babies while this entire post was about how under informed the world is on the cause of MANY(NOT ALL) of these killings are, like i said most of the teens/kids who are killed are because of terror attacks they commited/tried to commit, but some of you posted about the bombings of children which i stated again and again that i condemn and every one of these crimes has to be investigated and punished...

1ex2xm1,What is a reliable source?,2024-08-20 18:21:34,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ex2xm1/what_is_a_reliable_source/,"If we are to exclude the sources that Zionists have already told me are not reliable, then we can't rely on United Nations, Al Jazeera and any other Arabic and/or MENA journal, and most international NGOs whatsoever. If we do the same with sources anti-Zionists have already told me are not reliable, then we can't rely on Western media at all (be it American news, European news, Australian news). Also, most of independent journalists and journals aren't reliable depending on who you're talking to, may they be Zionists or anti-Zionists.

Having said that, all we have left are Israeli news. According to most Zionists I've talked to, not all Israeli news are to be trusted, Haaretz and sometimes Maariv as example. While most anti-Zionists I've talked to dismissed sources like Yedioth and Hayom.

I'm obviously more inclined to trust sources anti-Zionists says are reliable sources, because, to be honest, the Zionist argument when it comes to sources always seems to be ""the only sources we trust are the non-antisemitic sources but any source that is not aligned with our view is anti-Semitic, therefore, the only sources to be trusted are the openly Zionists sources or, at least, the Zionist-friendly or the pro-current-israeli-government sources"".

When it comes to the number of deaths in Gaza, for example, the only reliable source (according to Zionists I've talked to) is the Israeli government. The Gaza government (Hamas) is not reliable, as well as independent sources or international sources (unless they agree with the Israeli government estimatives).

So, after all, what exactly and objectively is a reliable source?"

I really don't get it, why do these European countries like Spain, Ireland, Norway and Slovenia choose to backstab the Jews and recognize Palestine while the Jews are in the middle of such a difficult time defending themselves in the trenches of Rafah and the communities in the hills of Judea & Samaria when a genocide was attempted on them on Oct 7th? Almost half of the EU members now recognize Palestine.



It's good to see these anti-semitic countries now facing consequences for their actions and further steps have been taken to freeze much of the aid donated to the PA. Why is Israel supposed to send aid to them and to Hamas in Gaza? It doesn't make much sense to me.



I wish there could be similar consequences imposed on the other 145 countries that have chosen to recognize the State of Palestine. This should also hopefully discourage other future ones from recognizing Palestine as well, there were reports that Malta, Japan, South Korea plan to do so in the future, but now they know what will happen to them for doing so.

Israel has occupied the territories in the interest of it own safety.

However, the requirements of creating a modern state have not been met by the Palestinians.

To have a modern state accepted by the whole world,  WB and Gaza united can make a declaration of  independence. However for it to stick,  they would have to do the following:

1. Expel Terrorists from its government ranks.
2. Disband militias and organizations funded and controlled by IRI.
3. Establish equal civil rights for all the citizens of the region regardless of Ethnicity, Race or Religion.
4. Form a proper democratic government, elected by all of the people.
5. Destroy the tunnels used for terror and smuggling.

I lol'd as I read this list I just wrote. It is comical because 4 of 5 these items should be a given standard for civilized society in the 21st century, and the 5th shouldn't ever have come up.

Instead of being a part of the world, Palestinians choose to use violence to expel the Jews; it's in the Hamas charter and according to polls, a majority of Palestinians support Hamas and its terror campaign. They import the Iranian war machine. They would never allow the existence of Jews in their state. Gangsters and thugs run the show and rig elections so they can siphon funds to enrich themselves; I'm looking at you Arafat & Abbas, not to mention the Hamas goons in Turkey and Qatar.

The Pro-Palestinians always claim that this a resistance to an occupation and blockade. Sure, Israel has control of the area but only because it has to. If left to their own devices Hamas would create a giant war machine to kill Jews. That is racist you say?

Well, Israel gave them a shot. In 2005,  IDF left Gaza and took all the Jews with them. Jews have been in Gaza continuously for literally thousands of years. Gazan elected Hamas as their leadership and started firing rockets at Israeli citizens. Israel had to create the blockade because Hamas was importing weapons en masse. Israel didn't prevent food, medicine from coming in. Israel let Gazans into Israel to work or visit hospitals for treatment of their diseases. In return for their autonomy, Gazans created a hornets nest with a maze of tunnels to inflict terror on Israel. On Oct. 7, Hamas invaded Israel with 15th century style tactics of murdering, raping, burning and kidnapping Israeli citizens. Resistance? Gimme an f'in break

What about Right of Return? Who wants to return? How many Palestinians were actually expelled from Israel and want to return now? If you count the descendants its 10 million refugees. In reality, there are only tens of thousands of actual refugees. 90%+ of the Palestinians were born in Arab controlled regions after 1948. What are they returning to? Most Palestinians were refugees from other Arab countries before that.  (Ironically, they want the right to return to Israel but want to expel Jews and ethnically cleanse them from the West Bank). 

Every Muslim country has ethnically cleansed away 99% of their Jewish population in the past 50 years. These are the refugees. Believe me, I am one, a Jew that can never return to the country that my family has lived in for thousands of years.

But, but, but, Netanyahu wants this war for his own corrupt control of the government. The Right Wing is trying to take all of J&S and expel all the Palestinians to maintain a Jewish Majority. Or the next baloney political theory. All of these argument fail because the Palestinians cannot negotiate in good faith. Until then, it doesn't make a difference what Bibi and Right Nut Jobs say. They are just playing politics for their own agendas knowing they have no control of the solution. 

For real, how can Israel negotiate peace with a society that is actively threatening their lives? They teach hate and antisemitism in children's classrooms. They indiscriminately fire rockets at civilians. They send their son's into populated areas wearing a vest made of explosions. He is a Martyr, Glory to Allah (PA starts sending checks to the mothers). 

If Palestinians threw down their weapons and entered into a peace treaty, Israel will be the first to invest billions of dollars in rebuilding the government; infrastructure, and industry. Israel has always provided benefits to and enriched its allies, including its Arab allies. (They would love to spend the billions to rebuild instead of the tens of billions to restock Iron Dome)

I encourage the Pro-Palestinian views of this. How is it Israel's fault that the Palestinian cannot declare independence? Why can't Palestinians just do the 5 basic tenets listed above? Why haven't they done even one of them? Why is acceptable to have a government that is the puppet of Islamic Regime? Iran will make Martyrs of every Palestinian citizen before a drop of Iranian blood falls. 

Why is this acceptable to you the Palestinians?

1ew6y54,We're Headed Towards a Long-Term Israeli Occupation of Gaza,2024-08-19 16:57:28,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ew6y54/were_headed_towards_a_longterm_israeli_occupation/,"Expressing my thoughts here because I think it'll be interesting to see the replies. But I think we're headed towards an expensive, costly, permanent Israeli occupation of Gaza for at least the next 5-10 years. And I think world leaders and the Israeli public are deluding themselves if they think that can be averted. My logical process.

**1. There won't be a ceasefire** - Netanyahu has made it clear he won't accept any sort of deal that Hamas would also accept and vice versa. Leaving out who's more culpable, I think a ceasefire just isn't coming. The US will never meaningfully pressure Netanyahu to settle, and Egypt and Qatar feel burned after they pressured Hamas and Netanyahu made new demands and killed the lead negotiator. A ceasefire isn't coming.

**2. ""Total victory"" is not possible** - Israel doesn't have the capability to achieve a ""total victory"" where Hamas is destroyed, Palestinian Islamic Jihad is banished, and Israel brings their boys home. CNN forensic analysis has indicated that Hamas is degraded, but still very much functional as a guerilla force and its losses have been partially replenished by thousands of new recruits from Gazans who hate Israel. Israel will not destroy Hamas and then destroy whatever succeeds it if they managed to.

**3. Nobody is occupying Gaza for Israel** - Israel's stated solution to the above is that a multinational force should back local officials in Gaza in setting up a new government. They have continued to insist on this even as Arab countries have stated flatly that they will not occupy nor rebuild Gaza unless it leads to a two-state solution. And since Israel has made it official that they will never, ever accept a Palestinian state, that means that no multinational force is coming. The same goes for the UN, and not even a Trump administration would deploy American troops to die in Gaza.

**4. Nobody is paying to rebuild Gaza** - See above. Absent Israel committing to a permanent solution, the same entities that won't send troops to Gaza won't pay for reconstruction. America and the UN aren't footing that bill, nor will Israel. Humanitarian agencies will continue to bring food into Gaza, but they'll be feeding massive refugee camps without clean water, safe food, or basic medical care.

Which leads to what I think the ""end"" of the war will look like - a new, long-term Israeli occupation of the ruins of Gaza fighting a never-ending Hamas or post-Hamas insurgency in the midst of a desperate, hungry population that hates them and refuses to cooperate in any meaningful way. At least until Israel's economic and human losses mount to the point that Israel is forced by its public to head to the table.

Think I'm wrong? What about what I said is wrong? I'm interested to hear other perspectives, but I don't see any out except a brutal, bloody occupation of Gaza's smoldering ruins until ordinary Israelis just can't take the deaths and the economic cost anymore."
1ew5cxr,Unraveling the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Historical Insights from Scholar Mordechai Kedar,2024-08-19 15:54:22,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ew5cxr/unraveling_the_israelipalestinian_conflict/,"For those seeking a better understanding of the conflict, I'd highly recommend lectures by Dr. Mordechai Kedar, an Israeli scholar of Arab culture. I've seen some of his interviews posted here, but his longer lectures are worth a watch. 

[Palestinians and Israel - Dr. Mordechai\_kedar - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7Tr1-AjpXI)

This one from 2011 does a good job breaking down the many historical and religious factors that should be considered when discussing and debating the current conflict. 

He succinctly tells the story of the land of Israel based on widely accepted, long documented history. He reminds us of important pieces such as, the origins of the Palestinian peoplehood (20th century), the fact that Israel is mentioned many times in the Quran but ""Palestine"" or ""Palestinian"" is not, the reason for today's borders in ""Al-Sham or ShƒÅm*""* (Greater Syria region), that Islam is at its core an imperialistic religion, and so forth. 

I'm genuinely interested in hearing perspectives from all sides of the debate. Particularly around the idea of refugees and the disparity between how Jews have handled being exiled and how Palestinians have handled their refugee status. He says, ""The biggest success of Zionism is not bringing the Jews out of exile, but rather the biggest success of Zionism is to take the exile out of the Jews."" (42:50)

I often think, there's no way this history can be questioned, right? But one just needs to take a cursory look at sites like ""WelcometoPalestine.com"" or Al Jazeera articles to see another version of ancient history, one where ""Palestine"" basically always existed, where Palestinians are cleverly tied to the ancient Philistines, and where Jewish history of the land is made to sound like a subplot. 

Without context like this lecture provides, any critique of the Middle East's situation can be misguided. While facts should be the foundation, they're too often overlooked or distorted to fit different narratives.

1ew0oh3,Clear which side of political spectrum in USA supports the Jews and the side supporting Palestine,2024-08-19 12:37:57,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ew0oh3/clear_which_side_of_political_spectrum_in_usa/,"I've been following American politics for the past 10 months now since the Oct 7th Hamas attempted genocide began and I noticed something very clear: conservatives in the USA support the Jews while the left-leaning folks support Palestine and are very anti-semitic. Jews and Israelis should clearly support Donald Trump to become the president again soon.



For example, in his recent rally, Trump denounced anti-semitism and has promised to fight for Israel. He also has a very clear track record favoring the Jews: officially making Jerusalem the eternal capital of Jewish people and recognizing Golan Heights as belonging to Israel. This time when he becomes president I'm sure he will recognize Judea and Samaria as a Jewish homeland and hopefully Gaza as well. Similarly, other influencers amongst the conservatives such as Pastor Hagee and many Evangelicals wholeheartedly support the Jews and even consider them as chosen people. I also listened a lot to Steven Crowder and Matt Walsh who see things clearly in the middle-east.



Meanwhile on the left, we have Bernie Sanders who recently called Netanyahu a ""war criminal"". Imagine calling the head of the only tiny Jewish state in the world a war criminal, this is slanderous anti-semitism coming from him. We all know about the ""squad"" and their twisted views, they clearly haven't been to Israel or have no connection with the Holy Land. Similarly, I have heard some interviews of Jill Stein and she also hates Israel as well as constantly spews anti-semitic rhetoric. Amongst influencers, I came across some folks like Sam Seder, Katie Halper, and Matt Lieb and man do they hate Jews and reek of anti-semitism. I really think some laws should be created in the USA to prosecute these traitors and anti-semites and hopefully Trump will take care of it this time.



Overall, hopefully Trump becomes president and this would surely make the Jews more safe in Israel and everywhere else!"
1ew0d77,"Actual Pro Hamas wonders why everyone is being called ""Pro Hamas""",2024-08-19 12:22:35,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ew0d77/actual_pro_hamas_wonders_why_everyone_is_being/,"I've seen Israeli's unironically call the ""Ceasefire now"" crowd ""pro Hamas"".  It confuses me so much.  Like the same people who are constantly telling me not to support Hamas, that Hamas is bad, etc. are also themselves being called ""Pro Hamas"".  
Where does this idea come from?

The idea that anyone who doesn't support Israel is ""Pro Hamas"".  Actually, Ben Shapiro said Jews who stand against the settlements are Pro Hamas.

I guess the Idea is that anyone who doesn't like something Israel does is automatically pro-Hamas.  It confuses me why they would mislabel people, who clearly and vocally dislike Hamas, as ""pro-Hamas"".  
The ""purpose"" I could see is trying to associate them with the actions on October 7th, but I minority of Hamas is associated with that.  If anyone (other than Hamas) is to blame for those attacks wouldn't it be the Israelis?  
The thing is, if you are going to associate someone incorrectly with a group, why Hamas?  
Hamas is a moderate, pro-2 state solution political group in Gaza.  Why associate someone with that, when you can pick from a  variety of mentally insane groups, like ""ISIS"", ""Al Qaeda"", ""The Azovs"" , the IKA , or like any other group that actually wants to destroy Israel.  
Like I don't understand why people chose the group that has sent more ceasefire and peace deal requests than any other group associated with the conflict.

The choice of ""Hamas"" aside, isn't it really weird to call everyone ""pro-anything"" that they are against.  
It reminds me of dictatorships like the USSR and China, everyone against the government is either a ww2GermanPerson or a supporter of imperialist Japan.

Like it feels weird to try to shut down any criticism in this way.  Something I could expect from Pakistan, or Iran, both of them are ""Democratic"" but shut down criticism in a way that makes them de facto dictatorships, by accusing anyone against the government of being with the Taliban, or in Iran's case Israel.  
Is Israel going down that same path?  
I am sure no Israeli (or at least 99%) don't want that to happen, so I think yall should all collectively refrain from calling someone ""pro Hamas"" as while it itself seems innocent, its the beginning of a dangerous path to the collapse of the only defacto democracy in the middle east.

Also if you are wondering, yes in name, Iran is a democracy.  It has a Judicial branch that serves for life just like the Unite states, but in theory they have separation of powers just like the U.S .  
Just in practice its a masked dictatorship."
1ew0b6o,The 4th Geneva Convention prohibition on transferring civilian populations to occupied territories.,2024-08-19 12:19:54,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ew0b6o/the_4th_geneva_convention_prohibition_on/,"Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states: 

‚ÄúThe Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.‚Äù It also prohibits the ‚Äúindividual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory.‚Äù

This prohibition came to be after the horrors of WWII.  Germany occupied Poland and then sent its Jews, by trains, in cattle cars, to concentration camps and death camps.  

That Article 49 is being used now against Israel is twisted.  Nothing in Article 49 prevents indigenous people from voluntarily moving into disputed territory that their military occupies.  

Article 49 is also meant to prevent a situation where Russia occupies parts of Ukraine, and forcibly moves masses of ethnic Russians to that area.

‚ÄúForcible transfer‚Äù is prohibited. Article 49 was never intended to prevent civilians from voluntary moving to their desired city, be it for ideological, religious or financial reasons.  

Weaponizing Article 49 against Jews and Israel is a cruel distortion.  An international agreement meant to protect Jews is being used to harm them.

It‚Äôs also disingenuous to use Article 49 to claim that Jews who live in the eastern part of united Jerusalem are violating international law.  That land is not occupied, it was annexed and citizenship was offered to all residents, although many Arabs chose to be permanent residents rather than citizens.  The Old City of Jerusalem is the holiest place in the world to Jews and.  Jews lived there continuously for 3,000 years until 1949 when they were expelled by Jordan.  The Jews returned in 1967.  To say that one 18 year period of time means that Jews can never live there again is absurd and no ‚Äòinternational law‚Äô can change that.  "
1evz81e,Any credible estimate of Hamas losses ?,2024-08-19 11:20:58,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1evz81e/any_credible_estimate_of_hamas_losses/,"I am from India and blog about the Gaza war. I am apolitical and use data to analyze the conflict. I focus more on combat operations than politics.  
  
I'm looking for info on the losses Hamas is believed to have suffered.   
I use Israel's official data for IDF casualties, cross referenced with media reports.  
They have matched and I have commented in my blog on a possible mismatch.   
I believe Israeli figures on IDF casualties to be credible, because its is difficult to   
hide losses, in a small country with a free press. The casualties are also consistent with the extent each unit has been in combat. I have not seen different casualty figures from any source. 

I am having trouble getting figures for Hamas fighters.  
If I consider the IDF estimate of dead Hamas and use a ratio of 1 dead to 2 wounded and unable to fight anymore, the figure will be higher than the pre war estimate of  
the strength of all armed groups in Gaza. I have also not come across data on how many suspected Hamas were captured in Gaza.  
I have commented on Gaza's civilian casualties in my blog.

I would appreciate any info you can provide, with the source.  
My view is that Hamas's ability to offer a serious armed resistance inside Gaza   
has largely ended - I base this on the fact that the IDF lost only 3 men in Gaza   
since July 7, despite pushing into the last remaining Gaza strongholds and my estimate of Hamas casualties - I believe they have lost the majority of the force  
they had before Oct 7.

1evs9gw,"Do Palestinians and Pro-Palestine want a two state solution ? If yes, why reject UN resolution 181 ?",2024-08-19 03:41:26,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1evs9gw/do_palestinians_and_propalestine_want_a_two_state/,"United Nations Resolution 181, resolution passed by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in 1947 that called for the partition of British Mandate for Palestine into Arab and Jewish states. Despite the passing of the UN Resolution 181, it was rejected by Palestinian Arabs and Arab nations. 

Arab nations (Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Jordan (Transjordan), Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, etc‚Ä¶) started the 1948 Arab-Israel war by invading territory in the former British Mandate for Palestine immediately following the announcement of the independence of the state of Israel on May 14, 1948. 

My questions

1. If the Palestinians and pro-Palestine supporters wanted a two state solution, why did they reject UN resolution 181 and started the 1948 Arab-Israel war ? If only Palestinians and pro-Palestine supporters had accepted UN resolution 181, there would have been no war and a sovereign nation called Palestine would has been long established back in 1948, 76 years ago.

2. At its very core the UN resolution 181 : United Nations Partition Plan for British Mandate for Palestine is very similar to any two state solution, the map or borders may differ with each version, but at the end of the day, UN resolution 181 and two state solution aims to create two sovereign states, one Jewish (Israel) and one Arab (Palestine). Is the UN resolution 181 similar to other proposed two state solution throughout the years ?

3. If the UN resolution 181 is similar (not exactly identical, but similar) to a two state solution which has already been rejected by the Palestinians and pro-Palestine supporters 76 years ago which started a war, and now some Palestinians, some pro-Palestinians, many governments and non-government organizations are yet again calling for a similar two state solution. What has changed since 76 years ago ? Why do Palestinians and pro-Palestine supporters now want a two state solution which they had rejected 76 years ago ? "
1evhkmy,Settler violence is extremely over-reported compared to Palestinian violence,2024-08-18 19:25:59,160,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1evhkmy/settler_violence_is_extremely_overreported/,"Important note: Every death is bad. Is a huge tragedy. This post deals with comparison between the sides so it might read a bit detached. The intention is not to minimize the tragedy.

A few days ago, some settlers vandalized a Palestinian village and murdered a Palestinian. An action which is obviously extremely bad and was widely condemned by most Israelis, made front page news in most Israeli media and was even criticized heavily by the right-wing current Israeli government.

This incident was widely reported all over the world. Made front page stories in the international media, was directly addressed by multiple governments of the US and in Europe. Some even threatened to sanction Israelis over this. Fair enough.

Today, yet another Palestinian ""Innocent civilian"" murdered an Israeli. He used a hammer to critically injure him, and shortly after he died.

Where are the governments of the world? What sanctions are threatened on the Palestinians? Their billions in yearly aid are secure despite this?

For those who closely follow the conflict, this is nothing new. Settler violence, while obviously terrible and as I said constantly condemned by most Israelis, is making first page news in the world while Palestinian violence is hardly reported, if at all.

#Let's take 2023 for example, before October 7

According to Israeli sources, [38 people in Israel were murdered by Palestinian terrorists.](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%99_%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%93_%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%95%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%98%D7%97%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%91-2023). Hebrew source but feel free to use Chrome's translation extention.

Yet according to Betselem themselves, an extreme left wing organization with huge bias against Israel, [10 Palestinians died](https://statistics.btselem.org/en/all-fatalities/by-date-of-incident?pogeaSensor=%5B%22a14a397%22%5D&dateSensor=%221672534800000%2C1696625999000%22&section=overall&tab=overview) due to violence from Israeli civilians. Already almost 4 times more deadly violence by the Palestinians.

But this is not all, because Btselem is extremely dishonest, and if you actually click to view [the individual cases](https://statistics.btselem.org/en/all-fatalities/by-date-of-incident/pal-by-israel-civ/all?pogeaSensor=%5B%22a14a397%22%5D&dateSensor=%221672534800000,1696625999000%22&section=overall&tab=overview), you find out many of these were terrorists as well.

#For example some quotes:

>""Abu Baker was an Islamic Jihad military wing operative.""

-1

>""Additional information: Fatally shot by an Israeli civilian after running over and then stabbing passersby. ""

-2

>""Fatally shot by an Israeli civilian after he and another Hamas military wing operative shot and wounded the settlement security guard, and then fired at Israeli civilians,""

-3

>""Hebron District, live ammunition. Additional information: Fatally shot by an Israeli settler after entering the settlement‚Äôs limits and, according to the military, approaching settlers holding a knife.""

So even if you don't believe the knife part, he was trespassing into an Israeli fenced town... I'll ignore that one though I really shouldn't.

>Fatally shot by an Israeli settler after, according to the military, he entered the settlement armed with knives and explosive devices.

Another one justified if true, but I know ""Anti-Zionists"" only believe reputable orgs such as the ""Gaza minister of health"" and not the IDF, so let's ignore that one as well.

>Shot in the head by a settler while throwing stones with other young men at settlers

Good shot. Rocks kill. And if you don't acknowledge that, I hope you will experience rocks thrown at you, especially while driving on an open road, as the Palestinians love doing every single day (Thousands of yearly instances not even reported by any media). -4

>Fatally shot by an Israeli settler near the outpost of Mitzpe Eshtamoa, while attacking another settler with a knife and, according to the media, moderately wounding him.

-5.

#To sum it up:

Even after I grant extreme charitability to the Israeli hating mobs, and use their own loved sources, we see that during 2023, before October 7, Israeli civilian violence amounted to **Only about 5 Palestinian deaths if not less** versus the Palestinian staggering 38 number.

Over 7 times deadlier violence by the Palestinian side, the side the international media hardly talks about."

post 7.10 for the first time most of the general public in israel has started to hate gazans, and i mean real hate, hate as akin to sects in iraq level of hatred. post 7.10 with such atrocities as gangraping and burning alive a teen infront of her holocaust surviver grandama, filming on a guy phone how he was castrated, penis shoved into his mouth and burned alive, then sent to all his whatsapp groups from his own phone. the marching of the bibas mom and babies. or the shani luck stripped raped body paraded like trophy infront of a cheering horde and spat upon. most israeli do not see gazans as humans anymore.   
this is not a ""lack of knowledge"" on whats going on in gaza. at this point if you showed most israelis vids of gazan babies dying in agony, most wont care the slightest. 

gazans both tasted a glimpse of ""right of return"" at 7.10, got a feeling israel destruction is possible throuh arms, and truly feel they are victims of genocide.

post war israeli society hatred will be further escalate after the 7.10 caught alive trials, testimoinies of all the most deranged 7.10 atrocities, 7.10 national memorial day with museums that are mandated to all students, and evantual leak online of the most extreme autrocities videos.

gaza with hamas in power will return to periodic wars, the hatred of the war will be extreme to the limit, they will have a narrative of the brave warrior from 7.10 that will destroy israel for good next time. will have the 7.10 autrocites as national symbol. add to it mostl likley extreme forever poverty as israel will never allow any worker visas / hospitals visits / using of sea and airports / stopping of all israeli water / power / checkpoints / cell towers.

there is no happy ending, either one day gaza will manage to storm israel and genocide all,  
or there will be another 7.10 and with how radicilized israeli society will be to another 7.10 there will be legit physical revenge genocide as akin to assad style warfare that will end with 100k's dead and physical deportaion. or israel will do to gaza an azeri style slow deportation-emmigration by extreme misery, this are all the options. there will never be stop of hostlities till one of this outcomes.

1ev5rf8,Gaza Department of Education model to fill the void of an educationally powerless Hamas and UNRWA,2024-08-18 10:05:25,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ev5rf8/gaza_department_of_education_model_to_fill_the/,"The tragedy in Gaza ‚Äãis ‚Äãmostly ‚Äãthe result of what happens when an isolated population is taught what UNRWA and others did for history and science.

In 1948 the UN partitioned (Western mechanism) states including the Gaza area. On paper the territory is equal in statehood to Israel. Should only have to on paper declare Gaza independence, as the other did by naming theirs Israel.

‚ÄãOther than being at a historically diabolical level of misteaching, it's a common ordinary ‚Äãstate Department of Education issue‚Äã, in what is already enough of a state territory to expect the people have a functional one in Gaza.‚Äã

We need to fill the void of Hamas and UNRWA education‚Äã, with something. Easy option is a Gaza DOE ‚Äãwith online teaching standards and books, to review and comment on. Ends the isolation ‚Äãfrom the world that made it possible to get away with education fraud for that long.

‚ÄãWhere statehood is really the goal it's fair to get a Gaza Department of Education online fast

And after saying the last sentence, I just did at r/GazaDOE

Description reads:

>The tragedy in Gaza ‚Äãis what happens when an isolated population is quietly taught what UNRWA and others did for history and science. During rebuilding a Gaza Department Of Education fills the void by providing teaching standards and materials to review and comment on. This subreddit is a start in that direction.

I started off with 8 (this far) of the most vital useful posts, to show what I am thinking.

All posts have to be approved before being online. I don't want to mess it up with things out of place in a website for a fully transparent Department of Education anywhere. For now what I have been finding for turning Gaza into a functional state will have to do.

For Gazans it's just the name of the newest education bosses, which keeps changing anyway.  And they can comment too on topics. It's their Department of Education, not Israel's they have their own.

For Israel this meets their deradicalization needs. The IDF ‚Äãcan in turn help where they can inside Gaza, to make sure the UNRWA and Hamas have zero control over the classrooms. Acting in place of a responsible Gaza Department of Education took control away from people who deserve better for their and our tax money to the UN.  It's not something taken away or singles out Gazans, it's our helping put together a ""Department"" we take for granted in much of the ""free"" world. The actual truth of the history should be shocking enough to through Gaza have influence back to all academia concerned.

For what it's worth there is now a model Gaza Department of Education subreddit with what must be included in Gaza Public Schools. This one I control, with an Iron fist, on behalf of ethical teachers who must in their best interest meet the educational needs of students, not politicians.  It's now easy for me to explain what I wanted to present to teachers, to empower them to help Gaza by knowing about and being able to add detail to. Be in control of.

I wrote the UN Watch about our need to do that on our own because UNRWA never will, and needs to put 100% into delivering aid, with 0% involvement in the education curriculum of Gaza schools. The new sub is what was needed to host what I had in mind, without UN Watch having to.  A planned-in Gaza Department of Education will achieve the objective of rendering UNRWA educationally powerless, without compromising the educational needs of the people.

For now the Reddit example shows what is necessary to understand to get free from WW2 influences where it's not just Gaza, Germany was worse.  After the allies made sure German educators got their history and science right, Germany became a prosperous nation that does not have to live dirt poor through wars anymore. Be thankful it's over. The expected outcome for Gaza where it's treated like the UN intended, a state, or at least has a Department of Education!"

1ev2vyk,Why is it such a big deal if Jews prayed at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem ?,2024-08-18 06:40:08,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ev2vyk/why_is_it_such_a_big_deal_if_jews_prayed_at_the/,"Recently I read in the newspapers that an infamous Israeli minister / politician prayed at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. His actions drew international condemnation and angered Palestinians.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg58yj57jdeo

My questions

1. Why cant there be religious freedom ? Why does it matter where one choose to pray ? The Temple Mount is also a holy site to the Jews, why cant Jews pray there if they want to ?

2. From what I read, I think he just prayed at the Temple Mount or The Dome of the Rock (out in the open, in the compound). My understanding is that the mosque Al-Qibli is at the corner of the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. 

https://stock.adobe.com/images/the-site-plan-of-al-aqsa-mosque-on-the-wall-of-the-temple-mount-in-the-old-city-in-jerusalem-israel/333916051

3. To those advocating for a two state solution, which are many people, including many governments, so which side gets Jerusalem ? Who is allowed to pray and where in your two state solution ? What religious freedoms are guaranteed under your two state solution ?

4. Something quite trival such as praying can cause such an uproar, what hope is there for any long term peace in this land ? Cant they even learn to share ?

5. Maybe this Israeli minister is not being well liked, contraversy seems to follow him everywhere he goes. But what about ordinary people who may just want to visit or pray or see the Temple Rock, will you also condemn their actions? What justification will you give to prevent others from praying at their holy sites ?"

The Americans rarely did this with Amin Gemayel in Lebanon, and they have been weak in doing it with both Israelis and Palestinians. Now that the United States has opened a dialogue with the PLO, the Palestinians have to be told straight out to get rid of the notion that the Israelis are just modern-day Crusaders who will one day gather up their shields and swords and ride off into the sunset or that the Americans are going to squeeze the Israelis on the Palestinians' behalf. The Israelis are not just passing through; they are home. But Israelis have to be told the same about the Palestinians; that they are inextricably tied to their land and at home in Palestine in the very deepest sense, to. Israeli fantasies about transferring Palestinians to Jordan or getting them to acquiesce in a permanent Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, or getting them to drop the PLO as their representatives are just that‚Äîfantasies.

America, in effect, has to say to both Israelis and Palestinians, ""You are two people with nothing in common‚Äînot language, not history, not culture, and not religion. I am not asking you to love each other. I don‚Äôt expect you to love each other. The sooner you live apart, the better off you will both be. But the only way you can hope to live apart and at peace is by first coming together to produce a settlement that guarantees Israelis their security and Palestinians their right to self-determination in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Nothing short of that will ever bring peace.

1eusr9i,What do you think is the most likely long term ceasefire will look like?,2024-08-17 21:38:33,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eusr9i/what_do_you_think_is_the_most_likely_long_term/,"So eventually this war is going to reach a long term ceasefire. So I've been thinking about the reality on the ground of Gaza for some time and several things have become apparent.

1) Hamas does not have the military means to expel Israel's army from Gaza. The weapon supply has been cut off entirely now that Israel has taken the border with Egypt. A large scale assault isn't possible due to Israel's ability to destroy any large force above the ground from the air. They can take pot shots at the Israeli army but that's it.

2) The US is not going to withdraw military support from Israel. Israel is one of theost important allies the US has in the entire region. Regardless of who is President no one is going to throw an ally under the busnto protect an Iranian proxy group. The politics may make them pay lip service to the civilian deaths but at the end of the day geopolitics clearly point to nothing changing in regards to the US/Israel relationship. (Outside of Israel going nuts and dropping a nuke on Gaza or something.)

3) No one is going to be coming to Hamas' rescue. Hezbollah and Iran are very clearly not interested in a war with Israel in order to help Hamas. So as addressed in point one Israel will be free to prosecute this war for as long as it wants without any substantial threat from the other players in the region.

So with the above points being fairly realistic takes on the situation on the ground. What is a a realistic long term ceasefire deal? I think it's pretty clear that Israel will never give up their control of the border Gaza had with Egypt. With the proven massive supply tunnels linking Egypt and Gaza Israel allow that again. Essentially everything that goes to Gaza will have to be screened by Israel personally. This will mean that Israel will have to take a substantial amount of territory to make the new border militarily sound. Most likely at minimum 2-3 miles wide.

The border between Gaza and Israel will be fortified and will probably cut into Gaza's territory by flattening an area of land. Essentially making it a no mans land that will have a shoot on sight rule.

Finally I think the last thing that will happen is territory to the north of Gaza will be taken for settlement purposes. The right wing of Israel will demand it as a prerequisite for their continued support. I don't know how large the territory will end up being but it will be significant. Possibly one or two square miles of territory that will be surrounded with heavy fortifications.

So what does everyone else think? Is this realistic?"
1euqwq0,Settler rampage and pogroms in the village of Jit,2024-08-17 20:16:24,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1euqwq0/settler_rampage_and_pogroms_in_the_village_of_jit/,"Pro-Israelis here in the forum, how do you ever justify this? And why do we not hear as much talk about Israeli settler violence and terrorism as much as about Hamas!



This is absolutely insane what happened in the village of Jit: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dT7uffzvKI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dT7uffzvKI) Yet again for 4 decades now settlers in the West Bank have been going on a rampage committing pogroms against innocent Palestinian villagers who are just trying to go about their own lives.



Very often we find so many documented instances of settler thugs:

- Setting fires to Palestinian homes

- Burning down olive groves all the time

- Poisoning wells of Palestinians

- Blocking roads and throwing stones on Palestinian vehicles

- Killing animals belonging to Palestinians 

And the list goes on.



Just recently the ICJ clearly ruled that Israel is now illegally occupying Palestine and should not only withdraw its army and all the settlements from there, but should also compensate Palestinians for all the losses they have had. I completely agree with the ICJ ruling. It is time for Palestinians just to be able to live in peace and have a decent life rather than have to undergo all the terrors from the IDF and Israeli settlers backed by genocidal maniacs like Ben-Gvir and Smotrich. Most of the world agrees and recognizes Palestine as a state. Our hearts are with the Palestinians in such a difficult time now and hopefully they will be left alone to live in peace."

1eujyhj,Iran and Hezbollah chicken out? ,2024-08-17 15:10:15,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eujyhj/iran_and_hezbollah_chicken_out/,"Several weeks ago, Israel took out several high ranking members of Hamas and Hezbollah, most notably Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and Fuad Shukr.

Since then, there's been a lot of speculation that Iran and Hezbollah would retaliate like they did back in April when Israel took out several Iranian generals in Syria. Given the April attack was of comparable size relative to the initial Russian missile barrage on Ukraine, there was and continues to be concern that Iran will fire a lot of ordinance.

Most commentators seemed to predict that Tisha B'av would be the day that Iran fired missiles, but that day quietly came and went. Iran striking on Tisha B'av would have lined up with the previous pattern of how these terrorist groups would seek to disturb Jewish holidays.

To me, it increasingly looks like it was all thankfully saber rattling. There are a potential few reasons for this:

-Israel had displayed an impressive show of force throughout July and early August. Their intelligence is so good that Israel knows Hezbollah better than Hezbollah knows Hezbollah, and this creates paranoia among terrorist groups.

-Biden saying ""[Don't](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-814166)"" again actually worked! We're saved!

-Iran finally listened to international law, and agreed that retaliating for Ismail Haniyeh would not have been legal in any way.

-There is some secret communication in diplomatic back channels that was able to discourage a response.

-Iran hesitating to piss off Arab countries who don't want Iranian missiles in their airspace.

-Maybe Iran is planning the attack, and is taking more time to do so.

The best situation that I could think is comparable to the one facing Israel now would be the Cuban Missile Crisis. In that case, neither the Soviet Union or US wanted a full blown war and a similar calculus seems to be taking place between Israel and Iran in terms of avoiding a regional war.

EDIT: As of 8/24 (This post was published on 8/16), Hezbollah has now retaliated. "
1eug23s,What are your Israel/Palestine solutions/blueprints for peace?,2024-08-17 12:03:01,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eug23s/what_are_your_israelpalestine_solutionsblueprints/,"What are your Israel/Palestine solutions? It seems impossible for peace sometimes but we should still think about a plan. I'll share my opinion, which might be thought of as a bit ""controversial"". Firstly, I believe that the most important factor is a huge deradicalisation of Palestinians, similar to the denazification of Germany after ww2. If it's been done before I think it can be done again. From here we go down two possible routes, a) a 2 state solution and b) a 1 state solution. I'll start with a), For this to happen Hamas must be totally defeated, and there is one governing power over both Gaza and Judea and Samaria, which should not be the PA (Palestinian Authority) which sucks for a multitude of reasons including: it isn't democratic, unpopular, has rejected multiple peace offers, full of corruption, issues stipends to terrorists, teaches violence against jews in schools and have clashes with Israeli forces in times before. Next, Israel stops occupation and expansion into Judea and Samaria, then the new governing body of the areas of Gaza and Judea and Samaria becomes recognised as a state by Israel. From here they work on relations. And now to b), my idea for a 1 state solution, would be Israel fully annexing both Gaza and being split into both Arab/Palestinian provinces and Jewish provinces, but this wouldn't be forced/mandatory, but rather a suggestion due to cultural differences and possibly still large amounts of antisemitism in lots of Palestinians. Think of it like you think of chinatowns. Once again it isn't force, Jews would be able to live in Palestinian provinces and Palestinians would be able to live in Jewish provinces. Since the 1 state is Israel, to make it more fair, the government must be at least 25% Palestinian, these leaders would be elected through elections in Palestinian provinces, and I guess Israeli politicians elected through elections in Jewish provinces. I think this would be an effective way to represent both groups equally and fairly. But who cares about my ideas, what are your ideas?"
1eufra5,How the Gell-Mann Amnesia Effect Influences Progressive American Jews,2024-08-17 11:45:37,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eufra5/how_the_gellmann_amnesia_effect_influences/,"You get home from a long day at work and decide to catch up on some political commentary that you haven't had a chance to watch before bed. You open ""Last Week Tonight"" with John Oliver and are immediately inundated with a historically illiterate rant about the Israel Palestinian conflict filled with lies and topped off with a dash of Holocaust inversion:

>A phrase that gets brought up a lot with regard to Israel is ‚Äònever again,‚Äô an anti-genocide slogan often invoked in memory of the Holocaust. And it‚Äôs always been open to two interpretations: There‚Äôs the one that means this must never again happen to the Jewish people and the one that means this must never happen again to any people anywhere. And in the West Bank, as in Gaza right now, it‚Äôs pretty clear which one the Israeli government has favored.

Somehow you manage to get through the video without destroying your screen and the next episode in your queue starts playing. This time it is John Oliver talking about American domestic policy which naturally includes attacks on Republicans and Trump. As you watch you completely forget about your reaction to the previous video and trust everything that is being presented to you by the same person who unabashedly lied to your face minutes before.

That is the [Gell-Mann Amnesia Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton#Gell-Mann_amnesia_effect).

Obviously, most of us don't get our news from late night ""comedians"" but this effect similarly applies to newspapers and the mainstream media.

For example, CNN who purports to be the ""Most Trusted Name In News"" hired [Abdel Qader Sabbah](https://honestreporting.com/exposed-the-hamas-links-of-cnn-journalist-abdel-qader-al-sabbah/) as a freelance journalist who it used in its reporting on the conflict for 9 months. Sabbah was close to senior Hamas terrorists, praised terrorists, and even created propaganda videos on behalf of Hamas.

In addition, CNN uncritically accepts claims by the Hamas run Health Ministry and Gaza Media Office while prefacing any claims made by Israel as being made ""without providing evidence"".

https://preview.redd.it/8funwzqoo7jd1.png?width=1529&format=png&auto=webp&s=26a9bfb654b69bd32d4101503c375452d421802b

For some reason this clear bias is forgotten the moment CNN starts reporting on domestic issues.

The Washington Post is no different. After [interviewing the parents](https://honestreporting.com/washington-post-shames-israeli-hostages-parents-online-in-print/) of Omer Neutra who is currently held hostage in Gaza, they posted the following on X:

>‚ÄúOmer Neutra has been missing since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. When the Neutras speak publicly, they don‚Äôt talk about the ferocity of Israel‚Äôs counterattack, which has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians and left nearly 90,000 injured, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Swaths of the territory have been pulverized and international experts have warned of looming famine.‚Äù

For whatever reason the outlet did not want to use the words ""taken hostage"" and felt the need to criticize his parents for talking about their son and not the people in Gaza (in addition to blindly accepting claims by Hamas just as CNN does).

This is of course [does not include](https://x.com/HonestReporting/status/1809355503358595572) their accusations of famine even after the IPC backtracked its report, claiming Iran's missile attack was a sign of ""de-escalation"", and claiming Israel rather than Egypt was preventing food from entering Gaza through Rafah.

Despite this, progressive American Jews are more than happy to trust them when they talk about the election.

Next we have CBS who hired Marwan al-Ghoul as a news producer. Marwan was an official speaker at a PFLP event which commemorated a prominent member of the terror group who also happened to be his relative. In addition to having ties with the Hamas Government Media Office he also celebrated the Oct 7th massacre on social media:

Like CNN and WaPo, CBS is still considered to be credible when reporting on domestic issues despite its irresponsible hiring practices:

[Negatively framed report by CBS on a Trump policy that is exactly the same as a policy advocated for by Kamala.](https://preview.redd.it/b0c7x68vo7jd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=879b652ea1fea3342813c4aa2e7b2802b1a87547)

The New York Times of course has a similar [anti-Israel bias](https://www.facebook.com/HonestReporting/posts/pfbid02sc4JxdZXUjSmcub7h6T5usKY6c9guKaqxB1sfuZoUVPHM9SfoHi51sA3nABxVv8nl). Between October 7th and May 7th the outlet published 3,848 pieces on the Israel-Hamas war. Of the top 1,398 pieces, 46.2% solely expressed empathy for the Palestinians while 10.5% solely expressed empathy for Israelis. Out of 647 articles that were exclusively empathetic to the Palestinians only 2 were critical of Hamas while 33 were critical of both Hamas and Israel and 479 were exclusively critical of Israel.

Out of 50 articles about the hostages, only 28 were critical of Hamas while 11 were critical of Israel. Additionally, 72 op-eds harshly critical of Israel were published while only 23 critical of Hamas were.

Despite this the New York Times is considered to be trustworthy source by progressive Jews when reporting on domestic politics despite their blatant anti-Israel bias.

Naturally I could go on about [The Guardian](https://honestreporting.com/us-academic-skews-stats-in-the-guardian-to-compare-gaza-to-worst-recent-genocides/), [BBC](https://x.com/HonestReporting/status/1775526815156543642), [AP](https://honestreporting.com/the-good-doctor-aps-trusted-source-was-a-hamas-aligned-ally-of-ismail-haniyeh/), [Wall Street Journal](https://honestreporting.com/exposed-wall-street-journal-contributor-shared-terrorist-propaganda-fake-news-on-oct-7/), and [others](https://honestreporting.com/israel-at-war-the-media-battlefield-briefing-25/) but I think those of us who follow the conflict are more than aware of the bias all the media companies hold.

Despite all the blatant lies from the mainstream media and various personalities when it comes to the Israel Palestinian conflict I do not understand why they are still accepted as legitimate sources when it comes to domestic issues. While I'm not saying that people should start watching Fox News, American Jews have been inundated with the narrative that Republicans are evil and that Trump is literally Hitler from the same companies that lie to them about Israel and are directly responsible for the increase of anti-Semitism around the world. This also explains how after Oct 7th many American Jews were completely blindsided by how anti-Semitic the left was due to the media ignoring and whitewashing the problem for years (not to mention hiring anti-Semites from American universities and Gaza).

To sum this up, it seems like the same media that is lying to you about Israel is trying to convince you to vote for a candidate who's strategy will be the likely appeasement of Hamas supporters and anti-Zionists rather than the steadfast support of Israel and American Jews in the face of one of the worst anti-Semitic propaganda campaigns in history.

If you think my assessment is wrong I'd love to hear from progressive American Jews as to why the media can be trusted when it comes to domestic politics in light of their irresponsible reporting on Israel which (in my opinion) doesn't even meet basic journalistic ethics and standards."
1ets2ci,The Pro-Palestinian view of Hamas is paradoxical and hypocritical ,2024-08-16 15:40:29,178,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ets2ci/the_propalestinian_view_of_hamas_is_paradoxical/,"One thing I still fail to grasp about many Pro-Palestinian advocates I see online and on Telegram, and even in person from students I've met at college, is the somewhat paradoxical view through which Hamas is seen.

They are, at the same time, resistance fighters and also a group who bears zero responsibility for the ongoing conflict. These points of view are at odds with each other, but seem to coexist.

On the one hand, many pro-palestinians claim there's a genocide going on, Gaza is being destroyed, with some even parroting the made up figure that over 186,000 civillians have been killed. From this vantage point, the war in Gaza is one of the worst tragedies in the world. From this point of view, I understand with their desire to have it end ASAP.

And yet on the other, no one on the Pro-Palestinian side seems to have an issue with the fact that Hamas is actively keeping this war going, sacrificing thousands of civillians in the process, just so that it can force Israel to release scores of terrorists from prison. 

And no one seems to find this odd. Hamas isn't fighting for food or shelter or medicine for its people. It's fighting to release prisoners, many of whom are convicted terrorists. And even when Israel offers back, say, 100 prisoners for 1 hostage, Hamas will come back and say ""we want 125!."" They play negotiation games as Gaza burns, and no one blinks an eye.

Israel has made it clear that the entire war can end once Hamas hands back the hostages and surrenders.

 But Hamas, instead, is more than happy to keep the war going just for the illusion of victory where it can say it forced Israel into handing back hundreds of prisoners. This is essentially what Hamas is after, and their negotiating positions say as much.

People who label Hamas as resistance fighters seem to have no problem with the Hamas strategy of prolonging the war via bizarre negotiation tactics, but then will complain about Israel's war efforts to release civillian hostages who have been kidnapped (including the elderly and infants).

The lack of any voice on the Pro-Palestinian side demanding Hamas release the hostages and end the war is quite glarring, in my opinion. I've been to several pro-palestinian rallies at 2 universities in the Pacific northwest and, if anything, found that support for Hamas and the resistance is the main message and the rule as opposed to the exception.

If this was truly a genocide as they claim, why then, are they seemingly supporting a group that a) started this whole thing and b) is prolonging it as long as possible?

1etjvg6,Statistical Manipulation and the scale of destruction in Gaza.,2024-08-16 08:53:34,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1etjvg6/statistical_manipulation_and_the_scale_of/,"On this sub I often see statistical manipulation to come to the conclusion that the war in Gaza is not as destructive as it seems and that it is overblown by the media.  For example one comment I received is :

""Israel has dropped 70,000 tonnes of ordnance. They‚Äôve killed less than 40,000 people. A significant number of those people killed are Hamas militants. It‚Äôs still less than one person killed per tonne of ordnance.""

This comment is based on several misunderstandings, one the true death toll is as experts point out without a doubt higher as the people under rubble are counted as missing as opposed to dead, furthermore due to Israel focus on destroying infrastructre and Hospitals the methodology used previously that provided a certain sense of accuracy is no longer possible to guarantee. Add on top of that we don't know how many civilians the IDF chose to bury in the ground. And it also doesn't count he indirect death caused by starvation and the destruction of the healthcare system.

I will illustrate the destructive pace of this conflict by using the estimated figures of Lancet, which estimates that roundabout 186.000 people have been killed during the 10 short months of this conflict. Rounded up, this is 2% of the population in Gaza

The Ukraine war which has been raging on for 10 years has killed 0.8% of the population.

The Darfur conflict in Sudan killed 6-7% of the population **but that started in 2003. 21 years.**

The Syrian civil war killed 2.3% of the population in 13 years.

As you can see by cross referencing the time it too to get at this percentage of people killed during the conflicts, that the Gaza war is unprecedented in its destructiveness and scale and has the potential if this rate continues to be the most destructive war since WW2.

Am I correct in saying this, please pull me up where im wrong.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Edit: 16/08/2024

It has come to my attention that this article in the Lancet that I'm using in my statistic is not peer reviewed. Yet I will persist in using them as they are the most accurate that we have with the data that we have available and to say it is not peer reviewed does not imply that it has been rigorously reviewed by those writing the correspondence. I accept that I cannot use as a fact on the grounds, nonetheless it does retain value in illustrating what potential scenario will unfold due to the Israeli onslaught on Gaza.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Edit 16/08/2024

16:37

It has come to my attention that not taking into account Population density in a urban conflict like this would also serve to statically mislead. So I did some more research and this is what I found:

Ukraine:  
With \~0.8% of the population killed, the conflict in Ukraine is highly destructive, particularly in terms of territorial impact and infrastructure damage, but the effect is less concentrated compared to Gaza or Syria. \~75 people per square kilometer

Syrian Civil War:  
Syria had a moderately high population density (\~118 people per square kilometer). Approximately 2.3% to 2.7% of the pre-conflict population has been killed. the most destructive in terms of both the high percentage of the population killed and the significant impact on a moderately dense population, combined with the overall societal destruction.

Darfur conflict:

Low (\~21 people per square kilometer). extremely destructive due to the very high percentage of the population killed, despite its lower population density. Approximately 6.7% have been killed

Gaza Conflict:  
Approximately 1.9%. dead. Gaza is one of the most densely populated areas in the world (\~5,500 people per square kilometer). Highly destructive, particularly due to its extreme population density, which exacerbates the impact of the conflict. Add to that it was only 10 months that this has happened in, this pace still puts it on course to be the most destructive since WW2 if it continues under current conditions. Currently it is the most destructive in concentrated impact."

Add to that the fact that during the Babylonian exile, not all Jewish people were exiled. It was mainly the educated and elite. It seems likely that the Romans would‚Äôve done something similar by expelling/enslaving the Judean (Jewish) elite and leaving the Jewish peasants to work the land. These would‚Äôve been mostly uneducated and illiterate Jewish people. Even the early Zionists suspected that the people living there were descended from Jewish people a long time ago. 

Also, a lot of them look Jewish in my opinion. 

Listening to Palestinians talk about their history, it sounds like most of them don‚Äôt know much of anything tbh. They can‚Äôt think of any famous Palestinians except for Arafat (born in Egypt) or Jesus (who was Jewish). Or they talk about Canaanites even though Judaism comes from Bronze Age Canaanite religion. They act like history skipped from the Canaanites to Islam and there was nothing in between. It seems like their main argument is ‚ÄúWe live on this land, and it is ours,‚Äù which okay, fair enough, but don‚Äôt kill your neighbors. 

I think that Jewish people would live in one state with Palestinians in a heartbeat if they could guarantee they wouldn‚Äôt be killed or treated like second class citizens. Listening to most Palestinians talk about Jewish people, it sounds like they‚Äôre describing a cartoon villain. They don‚Äôt see Jewish people as regular human beings. It‚Äôs impossible to live with people who hate you that much, and to risk not only your life but the lives of your children. 

Is it possible that they could let go of their Islamist indoctrination to embrace a shared past and a shared future? 

I keep imagining a camera rolling back through the centuries of separation to the time when we were all one people living in Judea. Now perhaps we are all still the same people, divided by thousands of years, fighting for the same land that we both love.  I‚Äôm not Israeli, but it makes me cry to think about what could have been. 

I see this ending one of two ways: reconciliation or ethnic cleansing. 

Is there hope for reconciliation? "
1et90q9,A Parable,2024-08-15 22:52:00,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1et90q9/a_parable/,"Two brothers quarrel on the day of their father's funeral. They each expected to be the sole inheritor of his land and houses, and are enraged to hear that it has been divided between them.

Each remembers past grievances and insults the other has given him, and the argument quickly comes to blows, and then escalates to a life or death struggle. Both men have drawn their knives, intent to kill their brother. They are cut in many places, but one brother proves to be stronger. He tackles his brother to the ground, and with one hand he catches hold of his brother's knife-hand; with the other, he presses his own knife to his brother's throat, ready to kill him.

Through the fight, several onlookers have stood by, occasionally shouting advice to one or the other brother.

*""You should kill your brother,""* one of them says to the stronger brother. *""If you let go of his hand, he will kill you and take your inheritance.""*

""Will you do that?"" The stronger brother asks. ""Yes,"" the other brother replies. ""You have stolen what is rightfully mine.""

*""You should give him your half of the inheritance,""* another onlooker suggests to the stronger brother. *""Then you can let him go, and he'll have no reason to kill you.""*

""Will you do that?"" The weaker brother asks. ""No,"" his brother replies. ""It's all I have, and who is holding a knife to whose throat around here anyway?""

*""Well,""* says a fourth onlooker, *""Then you should take your knife away from your brother's throat, and let go of his hand. Once you've done that, he will see that you've done the right thing, and decide not to kill you with his knife.""*

""Will you do that?"" The weaker brother asks. ""No,"" his brother replies. ""I don't trust you, you did just say you're going to kill me. But if you put your knife down and agree to split the inheritance, then I will take my knife away from your throat and I will let go of your hand.""

*""Your brother has a knife to your throat,""* a fifth onlooker points out to the weaker brother. *""Now is not the time to agree to anything! If you wait, he'll get tired. He can't hold you down forever, but if you give up the knife you'll never get the upper hand.""*

The two brothers stay like that for a day, and then another day. Until one kills the other or they agree to put their knives down, that's exactly how they'll stay.

**Now let me ask you a question:** do you agree with any of these onlookers? is there something you would suggest that would be more helpful? If you were the stronger brother, what would *you* do? If you were the weaker brother, what would you do? **What would you** ***actually*** **do?**

These are honest questions, I'm not being rhetorical -- to me, this is a good window into what this situation actually feels like, and I hope it can get people to think about ""the other side"" as actual human beings with understandable motivations."
1et28w6,Hamas Is Not The Most Powerful Palestinian Group,2024-08-15 18:16:22,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1et28w6/hamas_is_not_the_most_powerful_palestinian_group/,"It seems the only Palestinian group anyone pays attention to is Hamas. Yet, they have clear opposition from a significantly more powerful group within Palestine that is almost never mentioned, except perhaps occasionally in passing: Fatah.

If there is ever to be peace, or even a path to peace recognized, it will hinge on understanding the difference between these two groups:


**Hamas**:
- Rules Gaza (5% of Palestine's land, 1/3 of its people)
- Seeks war with Israel to destroy Israel and create a single Palestinian state

**Fatah**:
- Rules West Bank (95% of Palestine's land, 2/3 of its people)
- Seeks peace with Israel to create a two state solution where Israel and Palestine can coexist


That's the basic difference. It's stark. Fatah is allied with Israel and the US. They fought a civil war against Hamas and pushed them out of West Bank, which is the vast majority of Palestine, but lost Gaza to them. Gaza is a small part of Palestine, separated from West Bank by about 40km of Israeli territory at the nearest point.

Fatah cooperates with Israel to govern West Bank, which is much more prosperous than Gaza and is peaceful towards Israel. They do not fire rockets at Israel, or oppose Israel with armed forces. Their forces coordinate security with Israel, and make about half of the counterterrorist arrests in West Bank.

Fatah seeks a two state solution, where both Israel and Palestine can exist in peace and sovereignty together. Unfortunately, Netanyahu and the Israeli right wing such as Smotrich and Ben Gvir oppose a two state solution, so they refuse to engage Fatah in a peace process.

Netanyahu wants all of West Bank to eventually become part of Israel, which requires Israel to slowly colonize West Bank with settlers until this is possible while retaining an Israeli majority there. This is the tension that exists between Israel and Fatah currently.

There are however, other groups in Israeli politics as well, who seek a two state solution in alliance with Fatah. In order for peace to exist between Israel and Palestine, these Israeli groups such as Meretz, Yesh Atid and Labor must replace Netanyahu in power. That is the path to peace.


EDIT 2: By far the most popular point of discussion remains the Martyrs Fund. People seem to hold onto the Martyrs Fund as their reasoning for not offering a peace process. So, if you're opposed to engaging talks for a two state solution with Fatah, that's likely the primary reason.

It's very similar to the way many Palestinians use Israel supporting settlers moving into West Bank as proof that peace with Israel is impossible. I would also argue that is not the impediment to peace they suggest, just as I do not believe the Martyrs Fund is the impediment many Israelis suggest.

In both cases, these conditions existed during the Olso Accords. They are just convenient scapegoats, which would be resolved through a two state solution. That's the whole point of the peace process. To resolve such issues. They are not reasons to avoid a peace process, but reasons to engage in one.

EDIT: I've received complaints regarding the ""Martyr's Fund"" which Fatah contributes to. This is a fund which provides compensation to victims of the war from their perspective. I don't find it at all a persuasive argument for choosing war over peace and a two state solution.

If we're being pragmatic, the Martyr's Fund is essentially the same as what every country does. They pay compensation to victims of the war. Israel also does this. I understand it is controversial, but this should not be an insurmountable obstacle to peace. More importantly, if there were a two state solution reached it would be completely moot.

1et0kod,Will Palestine ever get its own state?,2024-08-15 17:08:40,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1et0kod/will_palestine_ever_get_its_own_state/,"I don‚Äôt know much about this conflict, so I guess this is more of a question for the sub. Will Palestine ever get its own state?

I keep hearing that Israel has been willing to negotiate over the last 75 years but Palestine wants all of the land. I can understand why they want all of the land. The Nakba was such a tragic event for many Arabs, and I understand why Arafat , coined the idea of Palestine.

It was always a European term that the Arabs rejected. The Mandate of Palestine contained Jews and Arabs before 1948. The Arabs living in Gaza considered themselves to be Egyptian. The Arabs living in the West Bank considered themselves to be Jordanian. The Arabs living in Golan considered themselves to be Syrian or Lebanese.

Regardless of the term, many of these Arabs were displaced from their home when the UN project of Israel was formed to give Jews their own state. I understand the Jewish claim to the land as well. The Jews lived in Israel before Islam was even an idea, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Arabs were displaced 75 years ago and have had their lives uprooted and ruined.

So we have:

‚Ä¢Jews were there first in ancient times and currently have the power over the land.

And

‚Ä¢Arabs were there before the current Israelis, and they were clearly there first (in modern times) compared to common day Israelis.

So how do we solve the problem? Can these 2 groups share the land? Can they live there together? Should Palestinians be condemned for attacking Israel? Or has Knesset been so unreasonable that Palestinians only option is to attack and hope for the best in the aftermath?

If Israel is willing to put a deal on the table that gives Palestine its own state, will Palestinians be willing to allow Israel to exist in their own minds? Who is to blame for all this? 

Ok, well these are my questions for the more educated folks in the sub? I just hope that one day these 2 groups will stop hating each other and can live side by side. It would be such a dream to see Israel as a thriving economy full of tech innovation and thought leadership living peacefully next to Palestine, a country full of good, nonviolent people with oil accessibility and other offerings to the world. It would be great to see them treat each other as allies and as cousins rather than as mortal enemies.

The Arab world + The West have got to find cooperation. Israel is modeled more like the West and could be a great partner for the 2 groups. If this partnership is ever achieved, then I believe the world will see more stability, more cooperative economic prosperity, and more overall kindness. 

Maybe I‚Äôm just a foolish optimist, but I sincerely hope that these 2 groups can get along."

Hello! I am a host of a political YouTube channel, and am looking to hold a debate/discussion on zoom with the header of this post as the prompt. I would be taking the pro Palestinian/yes it‚Äôs a genocide stance and am looking for someone willing to defend israel. We will do opening and closing statements and an open floor dialogue in between the two. I believe there is no justified nor historically accurate defense of Israel‚Äôs action and am ready to prove it. Ideally, we would schedule 3-5 days out, though I am willing to work with any willing participant on their availability. If you are able respond to this, we can dm and I can get you my email where we can more formally discuss arranging this and what requirements/specifics you would want. It will be very formal, hopefully not a shouting match, and I believe a good educational tool for anyone as to why Israel is definitely committing genocide and other war crimes against the Palestinians which is something no action could ever justify. Thanks for reading and I hope to hear back from plenty of you, don‚Äôt feel hesitant if someone else responds I am willing to do multiple people we can schedule individually to make sure everyone gets their voice heard. For reference as well, my channel has 12,000 subscribers and has amassed almost 4 million views in one year of existence, so it would be able to reach a decent audience as well. Cheers, and free Palestine! I am open to hearing differences in format, we can have sub prompts to engage with as well if you would like to talk more historically, am very flexible and all around just eager to be able to sit down and discuss this issue at length.

1esr80a,Why is every pro Palestine in love with Poland ,2024-08-15 09:54:25,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1esr80a/why_is_every_pro_palestine_in_love_with_poland/,"It is one of the most bizarre expressions probably because Benjamin Netanyahu is a Polish Jew. But they continuously say, go back to Poland and even now on Instagram someone keeps repeating like an idiot that I should go to Poland while saying I am from Turkey. 

These pro Palestinians have little knowledge about the origins of Israel and the ethical status of Jews. All they know is what everyone says to them and no one should try to deny because I was one of them too. I was also a sheep who believed everyone's words and hated Israel but with know knowledge I have ended up as a Noahide who sees Israel as his third homeland

Israelis bought land from Palestinians. Moving to another country is not a colony or occupation. There are many Turks in Europe now. Indians in Arab countries. Are they also occupiers no. 

Israel is an independent country. If it was a colony then someone else would be in power. Indeed, colony is a country that is under another country's control. 

Israelis are not Polish. 45% to 51% of Israelis are Mizrahi Jews kicked out of Arab countries. Iraq, for example, was a fan of H*tler. And like sheeps they ran after him. So if you hate Israel but not Jews. Why are these Mizrahi Jews not allowed to return home and had to flee? But don't forget. Zehava Ben is a more proud Moroccan than a European Moroccan 

Israeli society is largely based on Mizrahi Jewish culture. No one also denies that shoarma or falafel is Arab. But if you think every Jew is Polish what are you also going to understand about Mizrahi. Mizrahi Jews have their own falafel and shoarma. 

They claim to be anti-Zionist but actually they are anti Semitic. Literally someone says ""those are God's chosen people"" and underneath it ""I am anti Zionist not anti Semite"". Or they say under a Jewish video from America ""that house was promised to you 2000 years ago"". You literally mock the Torah. You don't even realise it. But we are talking about people who think every Jew is Polish.

Something else irritates me. Is that they also act smart and know the Jewish people and faith best. Everyone tries to make me believe that Jews will not accept me as a Jew. Apparently, the Torah would say that anyone who is not a Jew is not a human. There are 24 books. 5 Torah. 8 nevim. 11 ketuvim. None of them talks about anything like that. Torah begins with the creation of the world. Continues until Moses dies. Nevim means prophets. In the book of Job, he is also complaining. Ketuvim means writings and Psalms is a book given to David and it can be sung. Eicha and kohelet are books that mourn and lament. So who is telling you this nonsense too. Muslims have never managed to make all Muslims into one ""ummah"" people. That's probably why you hate Jews. Even now as Noahide, I get a lot of support from Jews. The warmth I get from Israelis and Jews I never felt when I was a Muslim

And oh. To make it completely. There were 38 countries that had a Jewish population above 10,000. Only Arab countries kicked out Jews"
1esogp8,Pro Palestinian and Pro Israeli viewpoint/Query,2024-08-15 06:44:39,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1esogp8/pro_palestinian_and_pro_israeli_viewpointquery/,"Hello everyone, 

I am a British Indian Hindu. 

I stand for the people of Palestine and I am also pro Israel. I am very much interested in this conflict and I have been following this conflict. 

I want to share my (very long) viewpoint and know all of your opinions on my viewpoint so that I can be more informed about this conflict. I also have a few queries that I would like to be answered.

I believe that Jews have a right to a state on their holy land. I acknowledge that Jews have had a continuous presence on the land for thousands of years and are indigenous to the land. I also acknowledge the fact that Jews never wanted to leave their land and yearn to make Aliyah. 

However, I also want to maintain that although the Jews may be indigenous to the Land, and were unfairly displaced for thousands of years, the Arabs (the so-called Palestinians) also have rights to that land, given that many of them have also lived in that land for centuries. There is evidence that there was a presence of Arabs on the land even before Islam, and even before the birth of Christ. 

I acknowledge that Jews constantly returned to the Holy Land, and I also acknowledge that by the 1800s Jerusalem was Jewish in majority. I acknowledge that the League of Nations was under a binding agreement to return the land to the Jews? 

Were the so called Zionist massacres such as Tantura and Deri Yaseen real? What is the evidence that they did not occur?

What is the truth behind the Nakhba? I agree that Israel has 2 million Arabs who are equal citizens and have full rights, and thrive in Israeli Society. I also acknowledge that there is evidence Zionists wanted to create a state together with the Arabs in 1948, especially in Israel‚Äôs constitution at the time which explicitly mentions this I think?

However, just because Zionists in 1948 after the Arab Israeli war wanted to create a Jewish state with the Arabs and later gave Arabs equal citizenship, it would have still been in their best interests to expel many Arabs to get a Jewish majority, to maintain the Jewish character or the state of Israel!?

Pro Palestinians‚Äô state that Israel‚Äôs claim  that Arabs fled because of blood libels against zionists of rape and murder/ instructions from Arab leaders only applied to approximately 200,000/750,000 Arabs that left, the rest were blatantly expelled from their homes that were later occupied but those who stayed in Israel. What sources show the truth?

Im going to make another post asking my other questions about the conflict."
1esmirl,Hoping for a deal,2024-08-15 04:43:00,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1esmirl/hoping_for_a_deal/,"I‚Äôm exhausted after 10 months of this war with so many casualties on both sides. I‚Äôm hopeful that a hostage for ceasefire deal, as many Israelis including hostage families have protested for, will happen in Doha.

For context if anyone cares for it, I‚Äôm an American Jew with familial ties to Israel. I was obviously disgusted by Hamas‚Äô actions on Oct. 7 as some of my family and friends had their towns invaded. And still, there are many hostages still in Gaza being held against their will by terrorists who don‚Äôt care about their lives or the lives of those they‚Äôre supposed to govern as they hide behind them.

I‚Äôve also been disgusted by the site of civilians being killed in Gaza, including children, along with the destruction of homes, hospitals, mosques and more.

I understand Hamas is hiding in many of these places among the civilians and have retaliated by sending bombs into Israeli civilian locations.

But Bibi and the Israeli government aren‚Äôt absolved either in my mind. Bibi was warned before Oct. 7 but did nothing, and I can only assume this is because he benefits from the perpetual conflict as does Hamas.

On both sides, people are seeing their neighbors die and are responding by being more radicalized, supporting governments that don‚Äôt care for peace, only the status quo.

With that said, I hope the Doha talks will result in peace. But even if this does happen, I fear this will be a Band-Aid fix while our kids on either side grow up hating each other.

If you‚Äôve made it this far, thanks for listening to me on my soap box. Stay safe everyone."
1eslydj,Investigation Alleges Israeli Use of Human Shields,2024-08-15 04:10:01,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eslydj/investigation_alleges_israeli_use_of_human_shields/,"A [Haaretz investigation](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-08-13/ty-article-magazine/.premium/idf-uses-gazan-civilians-as-human-shields-to-inspect-potentially-booby-trapped-tunnels/00000191-4c84-d7fd-a7f5-7db6b99e0000) (without paywall [here](https://archive.is/OIALF)) alleges that Israeli forces have been using human shields in Gaza, in the form of forcing Palestinians to check tunnels and buildings for booby traps. The article links to another article [here](https://archive.is/yERCA) that references Al Jazeera footage showing Israeli forces doing this:

>>""In the video, soldiers are seen attaching body cameras to handcuffed detainees and even dressing them in uniforms and protective vests before sending them into destroyed buildings and even the entrances of tunnels, in order to guarantee that the areas have not been rigged with explosives, before the soldiers enter.""

...

>>""In one of the videos, a detainee was heard calling into a tunnel, in Arabic, saying that the IDF controls the area, in what appears to be an attempt to persuade anyone hiding inside to turn themselves in.""

Haaretz spoke to soldiers in their own investigation and say:

>>""""Our lives are more important than their lives,"" soldiers were told. The thinking is that it's better for the Israeli soldiers to remain alive and for the shawishim to be the ones blown up by an explosive device.
>>This description is one of many obtained by Haaretz, some from combat soldiers, others from commanders. The picture that emerges: In recent months, Israeli soldiers have used human shields in this way all over Gaza; even the chief of staff's office knows.""

For context:

>>""The soldiers call each of them a shawish, an obscure Arabic word of Turkish origin meaning sergeant""

The investigation doesn't try to precisely quantify the scale of it (which I expect would be possible), so it's not completely obvious whether this has happened hundreds of times or in just a handful of cases one of which happened to be filmed. But the investigation suggests it was (and perhaps still is) commonplace:

>>""Soldiers choose Gazans for the missions and bring them to the brigades and battalions operating in the Strip. ""There is pride in it,"" said a source who took part in some of the ""locating"" work.
>>""The senior ranks know about it,"" the source said. The army has played innocent despite footage shown on Al Jazeera about two months ago. Israeli soldiers can be seen dressing Palestinian detainees in uniforms and flak jackets, putting cameras on them and sending them into badly damaged houses and tunnel entrances with their hands bound by plastic ties.""

Of course, this isn't the first time Israel have been accused of doing this. There was the disputed incident a few months back where they strapped a wounded guy to the front of a car and the IDF said they was ""against protocol"". There have also been several previous allegations of its use in this conflict, as well as in the West Bank since the conflict began, including a [UN report claiming to have verified](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/11/un-report-violations-against-children-gaza-west-bank-israel) five separate instances of the IDF using Palestinians as human shields since Oct 7th.

Interestingly, and perhaps for some surprisingly, this practice was only actually [outlawed in Israel in 2005](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/07/israel), when the Israeli Supreme Court ruled it was against Israeli law. The IDF at the time appealed on the grounds that they considered it a valuable tactic but didn't overturn the ruling. Since then there have been [sporadic allegations](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/un-report-accuses-israeli-forces-of-using-palestinian-children-as-human-shields-abusing-children-in-custody/) of its continuing use, but the Israeli legal system has made at least some attempt to clamp down on it, one example being a case in 2010 where two IDF staff sergeants were demoted and [given suspended prison sentences](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/21/israeli-soldiers-human-shield-avoid-jail) for forcing a 9-year-old Palestinian to open bags they suspected contained explosives.

Quick caveat - the IDF distinguished the use of human shields from a specific practice they called the ""neighbour procedure"", whereby they would send a Palestinian ""volunteer"" into buildings with suspected militants to try to convince them to go outside to be arrested. This was specifically mentioned as also being banned by the Supreme Court, but according to B'tSelem the practice has continued and allegations are very rarely investigated.

In summary - Israel have by various accounts used human shields in this conflict. The extent isn't well known, but it's been caught on video, alleged by the UN, and alleged by whistleblowers within Israel as reported in Israeli media.

What do people think of the practice? What are people's suspicions of the extent, as to whether it was/is widespread or a rare exception? Do people think it's likely that Israel will investigate thoroughly, prosecute and ultimately convict any offenders caught having done it? Are leadership likely to have encouraged it, known about it, attempted to stop it, or been unaware because it was done in secret, deniably, or on a small enough scale to go under the radar? Can any of these alleged incidents be disproven, or perhaps argued to have been in compliance with Israeli or international law? 

Should the morality of the practice be judged in the deontological sense of ""crossing a line"", a utilitarian sense of the IDF believing themselves to be acting to save the most Israeli lives as possible in a conflict they didn't start, or a consequentialist sense of only being something to condemn if it can be shown to have lead to Palestinian deaths or injury? If it had caused the latter, could we expect this information to ever be made public?

Of course Hamas also use human shields, so that may well be a valid point to bring up in any discussion, though it's a slightly different type. They're typically alleged (convincingly, to be clear) to place civilians in buildings or to locate their assets in buildings with civilians as a way to discourage attacks whereas the IDF are alleged to move around with civilians in front of them, or to force civilians to investigate for traps or negotiate with militants. We don't seem to have much detail on the frequency of either side doing it, but by all means compare if you have a way of doing so, let's not try to isolate the IDF's transgressions or wave away talk of Hamas' crimes as whataboutery in this case.

1esaxpm,Voice of pro-palestinian jews,2024-08-14 19:52:17,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1esaxpm/voice_of_propalestinian_jews/,"Why are Pro Palestinian Jews silenced, unrepresented and even arrested for their views and actions in the west? There‚Äôs a sizeable chunk of Jews in the west who support Palestinians, speak loudly in favor of them and protest against Israel. Why are they awfully ignored and shunned by the western political and liberal establishment? Granted their views do not represent that of most Jews or Israelis, but this hasn‚Äôt stopped other minorities within minorities from getting airtime. 

Conservative black people in the US receive massive airtime, especially from the right. Candance owens has spent years dunking on her people, the most conservative Supreme Court justice in the US is black, a black conservative senator was considered for VP nomination by Trump, I could go on. These individuals do not represent most of their race and ethnicity politically. But they go far within the western establishment despite and even because of this. Same can be said for conservative LGBT persons and even Muslims. Why doesn‚Äôt this happen with Jews? Why are only pro Israeli Jews considered legitimate voices in this situation? Never mind that many of these Jewish voices are not insane people who say stuff like Israel should not exist or Israelis should go back to Poland. Yet they‚Äôre never acknowledged as Jewish. 

Is there a hereditary system within Judaism that has made many of such people less Jewish? Is it because they‚Äôre mostly non-practicing, which would be odd as I assume most Jews aren‚Äôt orthodox/practicing? Or is it about degree of affiliation with Israel? What has made these voices so unpalatable to the mainstream of the Israel-Palestine conversation? Their treatment in Germany especially has been very bizarre to watch. What explains this? Is it simply out of deference to Israel and its lobby groups that these Jewish voices get zero respect? 

This reminds me of how the west coddled Islam and shunned its Muslim critics until Trump and right wing parties in Europe changed the conversation. And it‚Äôs odd because we‚Äôre made to believe disagreement and debate is embraced as Jewish culture. The conversation within Israel seems to paint a totally different picture, many articles I‚Äôve read on Haaretz and the Times of Israel will never be printed in western newspapers even if written by Jewish people. So is this all in service of this particular Israeli government?  "

Thankfully, those 9 soldiers were arrested. However, it is increasingly worrying how there are people in positions of authority that are defending their disgusting actions - and I'm concerned whether torture is widespread across other parts of Israel against Palestinians.

Radicalisation has taken place on both sides, since the war erupted, we should try to limit this as much as we can.

What do you guys think?"
1erz7g3,Tragic Intersection of Faith and Politics,2024-08-14 11:30:43,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1erz7g3/tragic_intersection_of_faith_and_politics/,"This is a deeply tragic conflict. Both sides are at fault, and both sides have committed inexcusable actions. While there are people on both sides who genuinely desire peace, they are unfortunately led by leaders who either cannot or will not find common ground. Over the years, one side may have been more at fault at different times. What makes the situation even worse is that both sides are largely motivated by books that, for all we know, are fictitious.

People have been killing each other over religion for centuries, and it's heartbreaking to see this still happening in the 21st century. The scariest part is that all this trauma and strife only strengthens the beliefs of those involved. It‚Äôs terrifying to think that if people realized that fiction might be the cause of so much death and suffering, it would be incredibly tragic to cope with that reality.

I'm isolated from this conflict, and I acknowledge that my views are naive. But I think the main driver of the conflict is leadership on both sides, as a result, that territory should go under the control of a custodian with a good track record (UN is the first thing that comes into my mind but they dont have a good track record) until the population there is ready to form some joint, non-secular government. Right now tensions are very high, but over time if the environment is right then old wounds can heal, and hopefully, people will start to look ahead insted of backward at the past.  

My overall view is that the separation of church and state is crucial.  Religion can be a good thing, and people should be free to practice it without harassment, but it should be kept personal and private. "
1erxz4l,The ceasefire ,2024-08-14 10:18:04,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1erxz4l/the_ceasefire/,"Why was there a deal last November but there hasn‚Äôt been one ever since?  

What changed? Did either or both parties somehow become more convinced that the war did more good than the ceasefire? Or were there hostages whose lives were prioritized and made a deal necessary?

It seems bizarre that something so doable at the beginning of the war became extremely difficult for months and months later on. 

What changed exactly? I feel both sides, especially israel, were incentivized to avoid a deal. Israel saw how much western support it had for an extended and brutal war and decided the hostages were a small price to pay to keep the war going. Israel realized the hostages were a perfectly legitimate cover to maintain the goal of eradicating Hamas. Without the hostages still with Hamas, the war would become very questionable. 

I personally do not believe Israel is unable to retrieve its hostages today if it wanted. It has extensive military capabilities and information to get them out, with western support. It is able to kill anyone it wants anywhere in the region. How is it impossible for it locate and rescue its hostages in an area it has controlled for decades and even more so in the last 10 months?   

Israel has simply decided that hostages should pay the ultimate price for its bigger goals in the region.  I wonder how all this makes the families of the hostages feel. They must feel like second class citizens after the first batch of hostages were released long ago. Why has a ceasefire become so undoable after the first one?

1erxkei,Israeli Army Uses Palestinian Civilians to Inspect Potentially Booby-trapped Tunnels in Gaza,2024-08-14 09:52:17,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1erxkei/israeli_army_uses_palestinian_civilians_to/,"[Article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/report-idf-sending-gazan-civilians-to-check-tunnels-homes-it-fears-might-be-booby-trapped/)

As often with Israel, every accusation is a confession.
Haaretz received testimonies from soldiers of different units, stationed in different parts of Gaza, on the use of Gazans prisoners to inspect potentially booby-trapped tunnels.
That is a actual, real, human shield.

There has been Al-Jazeera footage since several months showing this, but it failed to gain traction.

The prisoners are blindfolded, handcuffed and made to wear a camera.
They‚Äôre then sent into the houses or tunnels to map it out for soldiers.

According to the soldiers, the chain of command is aware of what is happening.
It‚Äôs hardly a new tactic, it was used during Operation Defensive Shield in the West Bank.
It was called the ¬´¬†neighbor procedure¬†¬ª.
Israel‚Äôs High Court of Justice recognized those facts to be true and issued an injunction forbidding it.

This will not surprise any pro-Palestinians, we knew for decades that Israelis consider Palestinian life to be worthless or at the very least less worthy than theirs.

One good thing to be taken from this is that some soldiers do not agree with those tactics at all.
They tried to push back from their commanders orders and when it didn‚Äôt work, i guess they went to the press.


I wish this news to foster a discussion on the topic of human shields.
Sending a human to potentionally detonate explosives before you is using a human shield.



Please, be constructive.
Comments questioning Haaretz integrity are useless.
If you think this reporting is disingenuous, provide information proving it.

Edited: mention of Hamas because that‚Äôs not the subject."
1erstvw,"This NPR debate shows why I, a lifelong liberal, have such an excruciating headache these days",2024-08-14 04:42:15,164,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1erstvw/this_npr_debate_shows_why_i_a_lifelong_liberal/,"Friday's episode of ""Open to Debate"" featured Cenk Uygur of ""The Young Turks"" and Mosab Hassan Yousef (ex-Palestinian militant, former Israeli spy, and son of Hamas co-founder) debating the question ""CAN ISRAEL MAKE PEACE WITH HAMAS?""

It went as pleasantly as one might expect. (Re ""Turks,"" I used to be a fan. Re Yousef, I think his voice and experience are absolutely vital to understanding this conflict but he really needs to chill.)

Anyway: Starting around 50 minutes in is a segment that illustrates perfectly what I see as my fellow liberal/progressives' essential misinterpretation of this conflict (and, frankly, all issues related to Islamism, AKA political Islam). 

>MODERATOR DONVAN READS A SUBMITTED QUESTION ADDRESSED TO UYGUR: ""Given that Hamas remains deeply and violently committed to the fundamental Palestinian ethos of *'No sovereign state for the Jewish people in ANY part of the land,'* what exactly makes you think there is room for a negotiated agreement assuming that Israel's own red line is to maintain and protect its very existence as a sovereign state?"" 

>UYGER (WHO STARTED ROLLING HIS EYES FROM THE FIRST WORDS OF THE QUESTION) RESPONDS:  Yeah, this is the same argument (the Israelis) always make: (The Palestinians) are evil! **uNiQuElY eViL!!** We kill way more than them, we've occupied them for 57 years, we've oppressed them for 57 years, but **THEY'RE uNiQuElY eViL!!** ... And by the way, let's acknowledge the HUGE amount of racism in (the idea that) the Muslims and the Arabs and the Palestinians are unique savages, naturally violent. That's racist, antisemitic, bigoted, and absurd. 

‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

Of course hating a whole race of people because they happen to be Black or brown or Asian or otherwise ""different from us"" based on appearance and stereotypes is racist by definition. And that sucks. 

But the question had nothing to do with race whatsoever. The question had to do with the expressly articulated political agenda of Hamas, and the openly avowed religious ideology of Islamist groups. 

Hamas is not a race. Islam is not a race. Political aims and religious ideologies aren't people; they are ideas that can and must be open to criticism, especially when they aren't from the past but are **still in play.**

The very fact that criticizing the religious ideology of Islam is legally prohibited in most Islamic countries ‚Äî and that Islamic penalties for apostasy and blasphemy in Islam range from lashing to imprisonment to death **TODAY, IN 2024** ‚Äî ought to infuriate every ""liberal"" and ""progressive"" on the planet. 

But it doesn't. Instead, anyone who refers to Islamic laws' rejection of most basic human rights ‚Äî even when the person talking is a former Muslim from an Islamic country! ‚Äî is condemned as a racist, a bigot, or an Islamophobe. 

Meanwhile, the POINT of the question ‚Äî Israel's concern about Palestinians not because they're brown (which most Israelis are too) but because their leaders, Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, supporters in the Islamic Republic etc, continue to promise to wipe out all the region's Jews¬π so they can create a region-wide Islamic caliphate governed by Shar'ia Law in which women, children, LGBTQ, moderate Muslims, Jews, Christians, Druze and secular people will have few if any rights whatsoever¬≤ ‚Äî is never addressed.

Not even to affirm that yes, Israel (like every country) wishes not to be obliterated, but (*insert some pro-Palestinian argument here*). This point is never, ever addressed in any way by so-called liberals and progressives, who are apparently unconcerned about the survival of the region's only liberal Democracy *(imperfect as it may be)* ‚Äî a country that's religiously and ethnically diverse, more secular in many ways than the United States, and a refuge for non-Islamist women, children, LGBTQ, Jews, Christians, Druze, and even Arab and Muslim people who simply wish to live in peace with their neighbors. 

Now THAT'S ""racist, antisemitic, bigoted, and absurd.""

My understanding is that Arabs in Gaza and Judea/Samaria were not interested in statehood until it was for ""tactical reasons"" (Zuheir Muhsein, 1979) in the fight against israel. 

From 1948 to 1967, Jordan and Egypt controlled those areas and they were never even recognized by the UN.  

So Gaza and Judea/Samaria are still stateless regions, right? (And it would not be a violation of international law for Israel to absorb them, I think, even though so many legal scholars say otherwise.)

1ern1rz,The demographic history of historic Palestine,2024-08-13 23:59:51,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ern1rz/the_demographic_history_of_historic_palestine/,"So the story goes the Jews were expelled from Palestine after the Bar Kohba revolt in 135ce all the way to the outer edges of the Roman terrroritory, only to rectify that historic injustice by coming back home to Palestine.

Only one problem. The Jews were not all displaced from historic Palestine. The romans killed alot of jews during the revolt, made Jerusalem of limits and took captives. Despite all that Jewish life continued in the Galilee region. The foundational text of rabbinic Judaism was formed in  particular in the town of Tzippori during this period.

Then the Byzantine age came about and along came the restrictions, bouts of persecution. Yet the Jewish community persisted, particularly in the Galilee region.

Then the early Islamic age came about and Jerusalem was no longer off limit, Jewish communities grew and yes some conversions happened all the way till the 1900 however, the Jews did not en masse convert to islam

Tiberias remained an important center for Jewish learning and they maintained religious and cultural practises

Then the Crusaders came and Jewish communities were decimated massacring them in Jerusalem and other cities. Some fled to other parts of the Islamic world

Despite the violence, Jewish life remained. in areas not under alot of control of the crusaders, particularly in the north of historic Palestine.

Then the Muslims came back, Jerusalem was once again a place where Jews could live, not to mention that Hebron, Tiberias and Safed were able to rebuild and thrive

Then came the Ottoman empire and here is where I'll stop. A glaring question has come about due to me meandering throughout history like this, Where do the Palestinian Muslims come from? and how the Heck did they come to outnumber the Jews in Historic Palestine at the moment of the Balfour declaration?

Back to the early Islamic period where some Arab tribes decided to migrate and settle in historic Palestine, however they were too insignificant to make up the difference in demographics we see during the  Balfour declaration. So then where do they come from? En masse large scale conversions to Islam. But if it wasn't the Jews whom converted en masse who did?

Meet the Samaritans, whom en masse converted to Islam. They are an ethnoreligious group originating from the ancient Israelites

Meet the canaanites whom came to Palestine during the Bronze and early Iron Age whom also converted to Islam en masse

Meet the Philistines who were likely Aegean in origin, part of the see people who migrated to Palestine in the 12th century BC, whom also converted to Islam en masse

Meet the Amorites, a semitic speaking people who migrated to the levant during the early Bronze age whom also converted to Islam en masse

Meet the Hittites, an indo-european people whom had their heyday around 1600 BCE, whom also converted en masse to Islam

Coupled with other factors like, for example the agricultural lifestyle of the Muslims which led to a higher birthrate whereas the Jews tended to congregate in urban areas leading to a lower birthrate, have caused the Muslim population to significantly outnumber the Jewish population of Palestine.

Correct me where I'm wrong and help me fill in some blanks.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

EDIT 05:09 14/08/2024

I regretfully have to strike the samaritans of the list, they didn't convert en masse to Islam

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

EDIT 14/08/2024  
11:10

It came to my attention that the way I framed this might be seen as ahistorical without taking into account the regions historical, demographic and cultural shifts¬†that have caused these ancient people cultures to be diffused in the cultures surrounding them. So whom had a genetic link to the Palestinian Muslims you see today in the period slightly before the Bar Kohba revolt

At the time in the area, there were roman Garrisons and settlers, Greek and Hellenistic people, Nabateans and Arabs and of course the majority which were the Jews. 

Meet the Phoenicians, the descendant of the ancient Canaanites, lived along the coastal region of modern day Lebanon and Northern Israel

Meet the Arameans, A semitic people who lived in modern day Syria and northen Israel.

Meet the Nabateans, an Arab people who esstablished a kingdom in the Negev region

Meet the Syro-Phoenicians and other Hellenized populations. Of mixed heritage both Greek and Semitic. The lived in coastal cities and urban centers

Meet the Arab tribes whom had somewhat of a presence in the Negev and Jordan regions"
1eresis,What are some good resources or books regarding Jordan and Egypts control of the West Bank and Gaza?,2024-08-13 18:06:44,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eresis/what_are_some_good_resources_or_books_regarding/,"Obviously today we see a lot about Israel settlements in the West Bank and control of it as well as the relationship between Israel and Gaza and what‚Äôs happening in Gaza now. But both territories were controlled by Egypt and Jordan for over 20 years before Israel and I think that‚Äôs a significant ammount of time that‚Äôs just not really talked about. How did Palestinians perceive in both areas perceive  Jordan and Egypt ? How were they perceived on a global scale and by other Islamic countries and ? And how does that compare to Israel now? Did they have settlements?How did both states govern the areas?

What affects cultural and political did the time controlling those areas impact them.I know more of  Jordan than Egypt and that Jordan has a large Palestinian population and many who are citizens but still would like to learn more. Events like black September are known to me but that seemed less in the West Bank than more focused on internally in Jordan. Did Jordan have a plan to originally annex the territories. How many Palestinians became citizens . What were some issues that came up specifically regarding Palestinians and Egypt or Jordan. There‚Äôs obviously events that happened due to their dealings with Israel of course but how were relations between the Palestinians  and those states directly . Jordan has more connections with Palestinians so I‚Äôd assume their rule had less protest .  Regarding Egypt how was Gaza viewed by Egyptians ? It didn‚Äôt seem like it was as important to them politically afterwards. Were there groups fighting across to Egypt proper ? How did groups like  the PLO view Egyptian rule. Jordan annexed the West Bank while Egypt just occupied Gaza what were some differences between those two processes. Where there pushes for a Palestinian state at the time to such a high degree like now. Jordan has a large Palestinian population so I would assume that many chose Jordanian citizenship and seemingly seemed fine with Gaza being part of Jordan. Or was that massive population of citizenship after Jordan lost the West Bank or were they not as big of a percentage as I thought .It would‚Äôve seemed to have  been easier to establish a Palestinian state during that time as it was Egypt and Jordan Muslim countries controlling the territories instead of Israel. And both Egypt and Jordan were part of the Muslim coalition against Israel in 1948. I can‚Äôt really see a reason for either to not establish a Palestinian state at the time instead choosing to occupy or annex the territories besides just politics and power and resource reasons? Did Palestinians see that as a betrayal ?How were relations between Palestinians and those countries over that time. And most importantly what were some major comparisons and differences between then and Israel in the West Bank now.

I guess I got off topic with all those questions but yeah what are some good resources for those areas and time periods?"
1erdakn,Anyone else here disgusted by Ben Gvir?,2024-08-13 17:06:29,131,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1erdakn/anyone_else_here_disgusted_by_ben_gvir/,"I don't need to repeat where I stand on this conflict, my comment history speaks for itself.

Israel is in a battle against murderous extremists

What I don't understand however is where they got this guy from, and why they didn't toss him out when there was a national unity government.

Ben Gvir is ostensibly the ""National Security Minister"" which begs the question of why he wasn't immediately the first to go after Oct. 7th. If that is just a title, then surely he must fulfill some major role in government that's something else?

Perpetually whining in government to try and keep Netanyahu from making anything that looks like a concession, he furthermore seems to be little more than a protest element for the far right, with loud, vocal stunts that undermine Israel's position on the international stage at any opportunity.

But now, today, 13th August 2024, Tisha B'av 5784, with Israel possibly on the verge of being attacked by Iran and the next stage of deadly escalation in front of everyone... surely today would be a day for national reflection?

NO.

***Visiting Temple Mount, Ben Gvir again says his policy is to allow Jewish prayer there***

*National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir repeats his message that his policy is to allow Jewish prayer at the Temple Mount, which goes against the unwritten status quo governing the site.*

*‚ÄúWe are on Tisha B‚ÄôAv, the Temple Mount, coming to mark the destruction of the Temple,‚Äù he says in a filmed message released by his far-right Otzma Yehudit party. ‚ÄúBut it needs to be said with sincerity: there is very significant progress here in the governance, in the sovereignty. As I have said, our policy is to enable prayer.‚Äù*

*Jews are heard loudly praying next to him, and footage shows Jews prostrating in his presence.*

-Times of Israel

Reflection? Forget it. Arsonism on a scale never before seen in an already tense atmosphere. His stunt swiftly invited condemnations from most of the Arab countries, then European countries, then the US.

But even that can sometimes be lived with. He furthermore invited the condemnation from all of the religious parties. Why?

For the simple reason that what he's done, and is doing is against mainstream Judaism, that holds the Temple Mount to be sacred ground that Jews are not supposed to set foot on (without the proper purification rituals that we don't have any more, furthermore the exact position of the ""Holy of Holies"" is not known). I have no clue what Judaism these people are claiming to follow, but it's some political aberration more than it is anything religious. It goes against the position of every recognised posek and the position of the Israeli Rabbinate, as well as mainstream Orthodox Judaism as a whole, hence the reaction from the religious parties today.

You don't strengthen Judaism or the Jewish people by trampling on the Torah in some bid to provoke people, even if they are Israel's enemies anyway.

Whereas inflaming further conflict today is already bad enough with Israel's enemies on this day, actually causing further division among the Jewish and Israeli people, essentially by trampling on Judaism itself, is just disgusting.

This guy needs to go, the sooner the better."
1er32sl,This conflict has made me deeply aware of the world.,2024-08-13 09:01:22,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1er32sl/this_conflict_has_made_me_deeply_aware_of_the/,"This conflict has made me deeply aware of the nature of the world in a way that I wasn‚Äôt. I used to be someone who had a lot of faith and trust in the west. I considered myself liberal and eschewed leftist ideological belief that the west is evil. 

When Russia invaded Ukraine, I argued with lots of friends who felt Russia was justified. I argued nothing could justify any of what Putin was doing. I listened to Putin‚Äôs deranged rhetoric about Ukraine and saw him for what he was, a revanchist nationalist dictator. 

As a gay person, my political journey began with atheism and calling out Islamic terrorism. This made me pro Israel and I saw the entire situation as Israel fighting Islamic terror.  I fell out with many in the atheist club when Trump was elected and many atheists either supported or made excuses for him and his policies. It seemed at odds with what I thought we stood for. We were supposed to be fighting Islamic terrorism and extremism, not Muslims, amongst other issues. 

My break from being pro Israel came when I started listening to Israeli leaders. Netanyahu made a UN speech where he defended Israel using the Bible, alluding to Israel‚Äôs right to the whole place. This was surprising to me. Israel was supposed to be the secular alternative? What was the difference between this belief and that of Hamas? On further reading I realized Israel had its own extremists, both political and religious. I read the human rights reports, the apartheid and the occupation conversations. The Israeli and liberal view is that these are out of necessity, but they‚Äôre pretty brutal and dehumanizing on the population. That cannot be necessity. 

October 7 happened and I knew this was going to get bad. But i did not expect it would be this bad. The images and videos out of Gaza. The countless videos of Israeli soldiers celebrating all of it. This is a conflict that has obviously produced psychopaths on both sides and needs an external intervention to rein in excesses. But one side is cheered, supported and encouraged? I constantly ask myself why I ever felt the need to support this country. Netanyahu belongs in the same cell as Assad and Putin. But while two of these are monsters in the eye of west, one is invited and applauded. 

Liberals say Gays for Gaza is like chicken for KFC, but the G in LGBT never meant genocide? I come from a deeply homophobic country and society myself but I have never felt my people needed to suffer 2000 pound bombs from the west for their homophobia. How has the bomb-them-into-civilization approach worked in every middle eastern country it has been tried? 

I think many westerners are simply racist and I‚Äôve become very skeptical of the entire western system. The self-righteousness that leads people to support and cheer what is happening in Gaza. The trust-and-never-verify attitude towards Israel‚Äôs actions. That the world sits by and watches all of this in 4K with no effort to stop it but supply more bombs for more destruction. It is all deeply gloomy and I shudder to think what lessons the enemies of the west are learning from this. "

1eqydda,(Many) Israelis have Lost their Minds,2024-08-13 03:55:43,132,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eqydda/many_israelis_have_lost_their_minds/,"After spending two months in Israel, I feel obligated to record my thoughts on the current socio-cultural political, and moral crisis that Israelis are currently facing.

I am an Israeli-American leftist and I‚Äôve written [‚ÄúPalestine is Ruining the Left‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ak1bdd/palestine_is_ruining_the_left/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) where I was incredibly critical of the uneducated Western Saviors that overwhelmingly make up the Palestine-sympathetic movement.

As such, I decided that a critical analysis of a similar format is required for the dogmatic, incompetent, and morally atrocious behavior and rhetoric of many Israelis. I intended to write this for a while now, but it‚Äôs incredibly difficult due to the emotional gravity and bias that I need to parse out internally. As somebody that strongly believes in Israeli and Palestinian self-determination, intersectionality, and the protection of human rights, here‚Äôs why I believe a scarily substantial amount of Israelis have lost their damn minds:

1. **War of Delusion** - Over these last eight months, I asked a number of Israelis and Jewish-Americans the question ‚Äú*Why did October 7th happen in the way that it did?*‚Äù and/or ‚Äú*Why did Hamas brutally target Israeli civilians and taken many hostages?*‚Äù I received a variety of explanations; the desperate geopolitical position of Hamas, an act of internalized raw hatred against Jews/Israelis, reducing the political stability of Israel, etc... These are perfectly reasonable explanations, but I've noticed that people frequently neglect psychological reasoning. Hamas intended to induce a vicious emotional reaction from the Israeli state and population in order to weaken Israel's international legitimacy and thus, increase international exclusive sympathy for the Palestinian national ""cause"" (usually Hamas's interests, not for the Palestinian people or an actually prosperous nation-state). For many foreign commentators, this intention of Hamas may seem obvious. However, the current Israeli leadership and a substantial segment of the population have repeatedly forgotten this goal of Hamas. They have taken the bait of Sinwar by inducing a psychological tunnel vision of death and destruction in Gaza. It resulted in an Israel that is largely tolerant of racist, genocidal, and extremist rhetoric towards the people of Gaza or Palestinians in general, abysmally high tolerance for civilian casualty for military operations, and a poorly planned humanitarian campaign. These attitudes manifest into the war goal of ""*defeating Hamas*"", a goal that will require a years-long Big Brother-esque occupation of Gaza, billions of dollars, and thousands of dead Israeli soldiers and tens of thousands more dead Palestinian civilians. Israel does not have the political(domestic and international) and economic bandwidth to sustain such an occupation. Also, internationally, Israel is becoming increasingly scrutinized and delegitimized in propaganda campaigns stemming from their abysmal marketing and horrendous war plan. The leadership of Israel and Hamas knows this, therefore, for various reasons, it's in their political interests to continue this useless war. The leadership of Israel is too cowardly and incompetent to attempt actual regime change in Gaza, leading to an inevitable unilateral or ""bilateral"" agreement to withdraw from Gaza, effectively letting Hamas regain state control, manpower, and weaponry. To competent observers of the first few months of the war, this was, at best, the OBVIOUS outcome of this war, which will create worse conditions for Israelis and Palestinians resulting in the next self-inflicted progrom. However, once again, a substantial amount of Israelis have drunk the cyanide-laced Kool-Aid with their insistence to repeat this cycle of hatred and delusion while embracing testicular-lacking leadership that rampantly proliferates this cycle for their own political gain.
2. **The Hostages** - Speaking of not learning anything, Israelis seem to forget about Gilad Shalit and the disastrous results of these hostage deals. Unfortunately, unlike Israel, Hamas does not care about Israeli or Palestinian civilian detainees. Hamas's ultimate end goal is subsidizing the Shahid economy by using the valuable manpower in Israeli custody to fund their hookers in Doha. It shouldn't be a difficult equation to see that trading 115\~ hostages for hundreds of bloodthirsty Islamists will result in an ultimately larger amount of Israeli(and subsequently, Palestinian) civilian deaths than the subsequent deaths of the hostages. Liberal Israelis(let alone the families of the hostages) are, understandably, hesitant to admit the reality that the cost of returning the hostages is ultimately future Israeli blood. So, instead of pursuing the pragmatic, nuanced, and boring case to finally end this useless war, they delusionally focus on the sexy plight of the hostages. This resulted in a celebrification of these hostages, with non-stop discussion, art, and news coverage in Israeli media. Subsequently, this hysteria hampers the negotiations, as Sinwar laughs, he demands ten more Lieutenant Osama Binheaders for Hersch while watching his family beg Netanyahu for a deal on Channel 12. Of course, this is the intended brilliance of the October 7th attack, creating an Israeli public so blinded and deluded by the fog of war that even the opposition to the vitriolic war is ultimately damaging to the Israeli people.
3. **Neglect of Morality** - The brutality of October 7th ignited an understandable anomie in the Israeli status quo of security and liberal morality. The atrocities committed on October 7th by a group that did not abide by the rules of war created a new level of desperation for Israelis that cleansed any remaining public faith in the laws of war or national intersectionality. Anecdotally, it was regular for me to hear the phrase, ‚ÄúThere are no civilians in the Gaza Strip‚Äù, a psychopathic Charles Manson-esque lunatic statement. You do not need a Ph. D to understand how that sentiment can justify ANY war crime against Gazans. The recent ‚Äúdiscourse‚Äù on rape in Sde Teiman shows the utter moral degeneracy that many Israelis are operating under, where a substantial(likely not a majority) believes that soldiers should be held unaccountable for those war crimes. Additionally, the amount of Israelis advocating for an ethnic cleansing and/or genocide of Palestinians in Gaza is astonishingly frightening. I have heard multiple instances of Israelis using Western colonialism of the Americas to justify a genocide of Gaza. Let me be clear, I do not think Israel is committing anything close to a genocide or ethnic cleansing of Gaza. HOWEVER, I have little doubt that a majority of Israelis would support an ethnic cleansing or genocide of Gaza if Israel pursued that route. A complete historical irony, considering nearly all Israelis are descendants of survivors of genocides and ethnic cleansings. Many Israelis have lost all touch with basic morality, unfortunately, they are typically the loudest and love to flaunt their idiocy and cowardice to Israel and the world. Needless to say, they make Israelis look like bloodthirsty lunatics who justify the typically hateful rhetoric of Palestine-sympathetic protestors against the Israeli people. Usually, these morally empty Israelis will justify their advocacy for war crimes by comparing those actions to the atrocities that Hamas enacted on October 7th, ‚Äúwhy should we abide by the rules of law if they don‚Äôt?‚Äù Every time, I shudder at the insurmountable IQ-less stupidity of such a question. Isn‚Äôt Israel the most ‚Äúmoral‚Äù army in the world? Why are we comparing our army to a savage Islamist Junta? My message to those Judeo-Hamasniks is that if they‚Äôre intent and insist on advocating or enacting war crimes against Gazans, they fall below my tolerance threshold for the moral and social contract of seriousness and deserve complete ostracization from social institutions. It‚Äôs severely distressing that contemporary Israel does not come close to that moral social standard.
4. **Neglect of life** - To any competent liberal observers, it‚Äôs clear that the Israeli public and broader societal institutions do not exhale a single breath in acknowledging the humanitarian ramifications of the war towards the people of Gaza. Regardless of the justification, nobody wants to acknowledge that approximately two million Gazans are going through hell in familiar deaths, destruction of homes, and widespread food insecurity a few kilometers away. Whenever this fact is pointed out, the tiresome cliche of ‚ÄúHamas is responsible‚Äù wipes away any sympathy or accountability towards the civilians of Gaza. Of course, Hamas bears an immense amount of responsibility for the current conditions of the Gazan people in their barbaric use of human shields. However, ask a Gazan if they prefer a relatively calm pre-October 7th Hamas regime with their homes and family intact or a regime that is cordial to the nation that is blowing their homes and traumatizing their children. This not-so-hypothetical question is what motivated Gazan support for a Hamas regime for the past 20\~ years, encapsulating the effective marketing for Hamas. The best weapon against Hamas is rectifying the suffering that Gazans experienced from Israel with solidarity from Israelis, as Israel is capable of redressing this suffering better than Hamas ever can. The first step of rectifying is an acknowledgment of their suffering, which is not a security risk, does not negate the suffering of Israelis, wins Israel international legitimacy, and can further legitimize Israel in the hearts of a decent portion (likely not enough) of Palestinians. So, rather than hours of wall-to-wall emotionally sensationalist Russian-style coverage on Israeli media channels of the hostages, hostage families, October 7th survivors, northern/southern refugees, etc‚Ä¶ Acknowledge the obvious, realistic, and disproportionately immense suffering of those in Gaza like every other credible Western news outlet. Just as if you show a Palestinian contextually accurate footage of October 7th, it‚Äôll (hopefully) be easy for most Israeli civilians to see the inherent injustice and suffering that is occurring in Gaza. Regardless of the conclusion, even acknowledgment is a massive blow to the Hamas war effort and Palestinian radicalization.
5. **‚ÄúAnti-Semitism‚Äù** - I have absolutely zero doubt that Jew-Hatred and bigotry against Israelis have increased dramatically after October 7th. However, just as Palestinians-sympathetics purity spiraled their way into over-generalizations and radicalism, many Jews and Israelis are commencing a trend of overreaction that delves into bigotry and extremism. Since the war, reality punched me into the realization that Jews and Israelis are completely uneducated about ‚Äúanti-semitism‚Äù. To clarify, I generally don‚Äôt use this sexy term for describing ideological or essentialist bigotry against Jews or Israelis for numerous reasons that I can write a separate essay on. Instead, I will be specific and boring, using Jew-Hatred, bigotry against Israelis, or disproportionate bias against the Israeli state which are obtusely intended to somehow culminate into the holed-umbrella term of ‚Äúanti-semitism‚Äù. This culminates in the accusation that, in all contexts, many Jews and Israelis think that bearing precious eyes on a Palestinian flag or seeing the slogan ‚ÄúFree Palestine‚Äù, is inherent Jew-Hatred or bigotry against Israelis. Of course, it depends on the context, but I have seen Jews and Israelis lose their damn marbles over an airplane stewardess wearing a Palestine flag badge on her uniform, a car with a Palestine bumper sticker, or a country formally recognizing Palestine. The nation of Palestine is not, and should not, be perceived as an inherent threat to Jews or Israel. This fallacious thought pattern is a disease that is kicking the state of Israel to its slow death, as it blends the only reasonable solution with an inherent threat of bigotry (which is why the braindead far-right of Israel insists on perpetuating this idea). The Israeli media is also in constant hysterics about small acts of real bigotry against Israelis. Instead of covering the multitude of actual issues facing the Israeli people, we get a ten-minute article about an Israeli being refused an Airbnb in the U.K. and other small instances of worldwide bigotry. Once again, to clarify, these incidents should be taken seriously, but Israel is not Norway or Switzerland, we have actual problems that our sensationalist media refuses to cover and instead exploits the Jewish/Israeli persecution complex that is justifiably rampant.
6. **Ideological Rise of the Far-Right** - Despite the high chances of a centrist government resulting from the next Israeli election, Israeli society has been plagued with the vices of unprecedented ultra-nationalism, normalized racism, and hyper-militarism that is a perfect recipe for a far-right surge after Netanyahu finally disappears from Israeli politics. October 7th and the subsequent war placed the Israeli public in ideal conditions for the death of the founders‚Äô intended state ideology of broadly liberal Zionism. It put Israelis in a desperate position, in which they cling to aesthetics based on emotional comfort rather than practical strategy. Unfortunately, due to the proto-fascist elements of Israel‚Äôs civil society that were widespread pre-October 7th, as well as the renowned weakness of Israeli liberals, Israel will be a decaying shell of what it was throughout its history of mostly center-left rule. Parties like Jewish Pride, a more radicalized Likud, the religious parties, and the pseudo-anti-Bibi right-wing parties will become more popular in the next few decades, smashing the mostly pragmatic liberal precedent that the original Labor Zionists set. Of course, most Israelis or Palestinians will not benefit besides the far-right demagogues in power, and many will be screwed by the sheeple that insist on voting for these spineless parties that invigorate the cycle of hate and mutual national destruction.

It seems that Israel is currently jumping head-first into an abyss of permanent despair and moral collapse, a statement that I pain to say as an Israeli. Lunatic illiberal ideologies and morals are popular and rampant among its emotionally scarred population. The events and experiences of interacting with Israelis sharply etched this saddening conclusion into my mind, no matter how much I tried to escape from it with the beautiful scenery of Israel. For any Israeli reading, please do everything possible to prevent these demagogues from attaining power and bring your fellow citizens to a status of competence and morality. This includes **supporting and voting for the Democrats** (both in Israel and America) in the next election.

**Criticism is more than welcome, do not strawman my positions or whataboutism** (including for Palestinian societies)."

1eqve8d,My view as a Christian Restorationist,2024-08-13 01:26:49,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eqve8d/my_view_as_a_christian_restorationist/,"Religious explanations for and religious influences on what is happening should not be ignored nor underestimated.

It is my deeply held opinion that, whether or not you subscribe to any of the following different eschatological views, their influence¬†on the situation is unavoidable. As well, I am aware as you should also be aware that like everyone else would, I will also unavoidably be portraying my own personal beliefs in the most favorable light. It is after all the paradigm which has most convinced me by which to view the world as it is.¬†

Concerning my personal beliefs and bias: As many of you may probably agree, religious views are similar to political views in that you may have your personal views but when you attempt to put a label on it, it by nature also groups you together with people who you do not agree with on everything. In fact, the people who I am spiritually closest to in this world I do not even agree with on everything. Taking that into consideration let's just say that I am a Christian with Restorationist rather than Supersessionist¬†views. This basically means that I believe that God's promises specific to Israel cannot and should not be seen as appropriable by the Church but rather that they still stand and will be kept.¬†Furthermore, I believe that [the Messianic Kingdom will involve the return of Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah](https://joelstrumpet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/When-a-Jew-Rules-the-World.pdf), not the appearance of a yet-to-be-seen Messiah.¬†That puts me in a camp where many beliefs are commonly shared with Christian Zionists. However, I do not view Zionism as something that my faith necessitates the promotion of, rather I view the fact that Zionism has brought so many Jews back to the land of Israel as something that adds to the validation of my religious views that would have expected that to somehow happen.

I do not believe the actions of the Israeli government should be blindly supported or immune to criticism, but I do believe in their right to exist, their right to defend themselves and I also believe that no matter where the Jews were to live in the world, antisemitism would regardless find a way to justify singling them out for persecution. I am reminded of a ""joke"" I had read somewhere that tells of a Zionist Jew and an Anti-Zionist Jew going into a bar and the bar tender telling them both to leave because they do not serve Jews.

Regarding some negative perceptions of Christian Zionists that I have seen. Years ago I remember seeing an¬†episode of¬†the original Law and Order called ""Rapture"" which portrayed Christian Zionists in a very negative light as whack jobs that just want to help Diaspora Jews return to their homeland in Israel with the hopes that they could eventually be massacred and fulfill prophecy. Mohammed El-Kurd seems to also hold to that view and even makes [the accusation that antisemitism must be at the heart of Christian Zionism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34wA_bdG6QQ&t=2189s). The context for him saying this was he was attempting to de-legitimize accusations that his stances are antisemitic by accusing Israel of tolerating antisemitism when it suits them. Right before saying that [he had also limited the definition of antisemitism to being against practitioners of Judaism rather than an ethnicity so he could separate his grievances with the secular government of Israel from any antisemitic connotations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34wA_bdG6QQ&t=2148s). Now, is it possible that some Christian Zionists are nut jobs wanting Jews to die? Of course, every religious group has their nut jobs. Anecdotally though, in my over 20 years of holding Restorationist views I have never met any Christian Zionists that supposedly long for the death of Jews. If anyone has seen different, please share in the comments. To be honest though, contrarily what I see as a more common temptation amongst Restorationist Christians (including myself) is to subconsciously conflate a blind support of the modern state of Israel with expressing reverence for God.

Looking at the 3 main branches of Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam), something that popular versions of the three have in common is that a large portion of the world will be waging war against the Jews right before the end of this age.

In versions of Jewish Eschatology and Premillennial Christian Eschatology Israel will be attacked by many nations and suffer heavy losses. The remaining of Israel will have become purified followers of the God of Israel and God will himself then fight those nations that went against Israel and then bring in the Messianic Kingdom on earth that will be centered in Jerusalem. During the time of that future Messianic Kingdom there will be peace on earth and all the nations will worship the God of Israel.

From the¬†[Jewish Encyclopedia](https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5849-eschatology)¬†which was written over 40 years before the foundation of the modern nation of Israel,¬†regarding eschatology (bold is my emphasis):

>In the popular mind the Day of the Lord brought disaster only to the enemies of Israel; to His people it brought victory. But this is contradicted by the prophet Amos (iii. 2, v. 20). For Isaiah, likewise,¬†**the Day of the Lord brings terror and ruin to Judah and Israel (Isa. ii. 12, x. 3, xxii. 5; comp. Micah i. 3) as well as to other nations (Isa. xiv. 25, xxiv.-xxv.). In the same measure, however, as Israel suffers defeat at the hand of the great world-powers, the Day of the Lord in the prophetic conception becomes a day of wrath for the heathen world and of triumph for Israel. In Zeph. i-iii. it is a universal day of doom for all idolaters, including the inhabitants of Judea, but it ends with the glory of the remnant of Israel, while the assembled heathen powers are annihilated**¬†(iii. 8-12). This feature of the final destruction, before the city of Jerusalem, of the heathen world-empires becomes prominent and typical in all later prophecies (Ezek. xxxviii., the defeat of Gog and Magog; Isa. xiii. 6-9, Babel's fall; Zech. xii. 2¬†*et seq.*, xiv. 1¬†*et seq.*; Hag. i. 6; Joel iv. \[iii.\] 2¬†*et seq.*; Isa. lxvi. 15¬†*et seq.*), the Day of the Lord being said to come as ""a fire which refines the silver"" (Mal. iii. 2¬†*et seq.*, 9; comp. Isa. xxxiii. 14¬†*et seq.*). Especially strong is the contrast between the fate which awaits the heathen and the salvation promised Israel in Isa. xxxiv.-xxxv.,¬†**whereas other prophecies accentuate rather the final conversion of the heathen nations to the belief in the Lord**¬†(Isa. ii. 1¬†*et seq.*, xlix. lxvi. 6-21, Zech. viii. 21¬†*et seq.*, xiv. 16¬†*et seq.*).

Though certain versions of Christian eschatology like mine may overall agree with that, the distinction would of course be in that it is believed that the remnant spoken of will be those who have come to realize Jesus of Nazareth was/is the Messiah and come to faith in him before his second coming, as opposed to them following a yet-to-be-seen Messiah.

Before I continue on to Islamic Eschatology, I wish to reiterate what I stated earlier in that people under the same religious label do not necessarily all agree with each other. How common and popular the following beliefs are amongst Muslims I could not say but I would venture that they are common enough to be prominently influential in those Muslims who most proactively influence the fate of the Palestinian people. If I am wrong, please correct me in the comments. Now, according to a couple different websites I find that answer questions on Islam, a common picture seems to be the following:

* There will be a war against the Jews before the end
* The Jews will be responsible for provoking the war
* The Jews are portrayed unfavorably and as following¬†Dajjal (false Messiah)¬†during this time
* The Muslims will be justified in waging war against the Jews
* The Muslims will prevail in this war

An [opinion piece](https://aboutislam.net/muslim-issues/opinion-analysis/gaza-tragedy-a-step-closer-to-the-apocalypse/) from aboutislam dot net just 1 week after October 7th, ends with the following:

>As far-fetched as it may seem, but the recent events in the valiant Gaza denoted a step closer to the apocalypse about which the teacher of all teachers ‚Äì Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him and his family ‚Äì informed us in such vivid and minute details.

>The Prophet told us that a great sign of the imminence of the Day of Judgment will be when Muslims as the only proponents of the truth will fight the Jews as a prominent segment of those who will follow Dajjal (false Messiah). The Jews could well be the vanguard of the rest.

>Hence, when the big one comes, a person should be capable of discerning the true character of each side involved in the unfolding bedlam, and long before then, both in body and spirit, he should be in the ranks of the right party. Otherwise, there may be no extra time for reassessment, nor extra opportunity for redemption.

>The Prophet said: ‚ÄúThe Hour will not begin until the Muslims fight the Jews and the Muslims will kill them, until a Jew hides behind a rock or a tree, and the rock or tree will say: ‚ÄòO Muslim, O slave of Allah, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.‚Äô Except the gharqad (a thorny tree), for it is one of the trees of the Jews‚Äù (Sahih Muslim).‚Äú

>The Jews will fight you, and you will prevail over them, then a rock will say: ‚ÄòO Muslim, here is a Jew behind me; kill him‚Äô‚Äù (Sahih al-Bukhari).

A few more examples:

* [In the battle between the Jews and the Muslims at the end of time, the aggressors will be the Jews - Islam Question & Answer (islamqa.info)](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/223275/in-the-battle-between-the-jews-and-the-muslims-at-the-end-of-time-the-aggressors-will-be-the-jews)
* [A war between Jews and Muslims at the end of time is mentioned. Will you give information about the talking of the tree or stone behind which a Jew hides? | Questions on Islam](https://questionsonislam.com/question/war-between-jews-and-muslims-end-time-mentioned-will-you-give-information-about-talking)
* [Is there a hadith of the Prophet saying, ‚ÄúKill the Jews‚Äù? | Questions on Islam](https://questionsonislam.com/question/there-hadith-prophet-saying-%E2%80%9Ckill-jews%E2%80%9D)

A detail added by Christianity though is that [it is Satan in the final days who will be focusing his assault on both Israel and Christians but more specifically on Israel](https://www.gotquestions.org/Revelation-chapter-12.html).

In his [piece putting forth an explanation for Satan's motives](https://arielcontent.org/dcs/pdf/mbs003m.pdf) Messianic Jewish scholar Arnold Fruchtenbaum ends with this conclusion:

>So Yeshua will not return to the earth until the Jews and the Jewish leaders ask Him to come back. For just as the Jewish leaders once led Israel to the rejection of His Messiahship, they must someday lead the nation to the acceptance of His Messiahship.

>It is this fact that explains Satan‚Äôs war against the Jews throughout history in general and during the Tribulation in particular. Satan also knows that once the Messiah returns, his freedom ends. Satan also knows that Jesus will not come back until the Jewish leaders ask Him to come back. So if Satan can succeed in destroying the Jews once and for all before they come to national repentance, then Yeshua will not come back and Satan‚Äôs career is eternally safe. That is why once Satan is confined to his fourth abode and knows his time is short, he expends all of his satanic energies to try to destroy the Jews once and for all. Anti-Semitism in any form, active or passive, whether it is racial, ethnic, national, economic, political, religious, or theological, is all part of the satanic strategy to avoid the Second Coming.¬†

Here I would like to interject something regarding this. Though Supersessionist Islam is currently much more notable for its antisemitism at this point in time, over the past 2000 years Supersessionist Christianity was as bad and at times even worse in its antisemitic nature.¬†The explanation this paradigm gives is that Satan throughout history has been attempting to simultaneously exterminate all the Jews while making belief in Jesus of Nazareth odious to those Jews that are living.¬†

I expect most who read this to find that crazy, but honestly on my part, looking at the world, that is the paradigm that seems to fit most what is observed to me.¬† The view that Satan is behind it explains the widespread, irrational, and intense nature of antisemitism throughout history.¬† As he in the Tanakh attempted to thwart the first coming through the same means like with Pharaoh(when Moses was born), Athaliah and Haman, so he does now with the second coming.¬†

Although all racism is bad, looking at history, it is undeniable that antisemitism is just plain other worldly.¬†

To quote¬†Michal Cotler Wunsh:

>Antisemitism was able to mutate over thousands of years by latching on to the guiding social construct of the time. Religion. Science. The secular religion of our time, my own area of expertise, my faith in human rights. And it was human rights that were appropriated and weaponized in order to enable¬†*this*¬†mutation of antisemitism that has become mainstream as we have heard on every single campus. It is that and all of those terms that have been appropriated in order to enable under the ""progressive"".. and it is not progress it is regress because October 7th showed us that that is not progress. So anybody who is supporting or not unequivocally condemning October 7th is doing so because as we have heard the Universities have relinquished their mission statement of teaching people how to think for a very very scary reality in which they teach people what to think.

And that some seem to lack the ability to see how bizarre and other-worldly the nature of antisemitism is even though it is so glaringly self-evident just adds to how other worldly its nature is. I do not speak of those who lack intellect, as even intellectuals can be seen to lose their ability to reason when falling into antisemitism. I could not find a free source anywhere (if someone knows of one please share it) but I have heard more than once that in order to perpetrate the holocaust, more members of society were involved than most people are aware and that decisions were even made to continue diverting resources in order to continue the mass extermination of Jews even after they had already begun to lose the war.

[An antisemitic war widow from the Netherlands on TV 55 years after the holocaust was shown some footage of the gas chambers and the ovens of which footage she refused to even look at and when the host confronted her about not looking, her response was ""Have you seen the images of Germany? Of all those bombings of Germany? A German genocide.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxo_P8jnlc0&t=837s).

And now in our day,¬†consider the abnormal amount of support for Hamas's actions immediately after October 7th‚Äîthe worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust‚Äîdespite the grotesque and utterly unwarranted barbarity committed by these so-called 'freedom fighters.'.¬†I heard it mentioned somewhere that the norm in a western city society would be for people to find it appalling for someone to rip down pictures of even a missing dog yet now it is common for posters of the kidnapped, including those of the children to be ripped down in cities all around the world. Less than 100 years after the holocaust, how is this possible? The best explanations I hear for this do not make as much sense to me as the one I mentioned earlier. But as well, like I said I am biased.

Before October 7th I would not have considered writing something like this in this type of forum as I am speaking heavily concerning my religious beliefs which I do not expect almost any to agree with here. I have believed this for a while now and I did not think things would begin to get so bad in my lifetime but October 7th, the worse attack on Jews since the holocaust also happened to be my birthday. That little coincidence makes the option of keeping silence on my beliefs as something that does not sit well with my conscience.

As a final word, none of this in any way is meant to condone the dehumanization of *any* demographic. No one is more or less deserving of God's grace in Yeshua and only God sees the heart. I have never personally met a Muslim, Jew, Israeli or Palestinian that I did not like. And that I am no more deserving than any sinner or that I could easily have lived like the most wicked is something I am reminded of often by God.

1eqiv7n,Investment in Palestinian land,2024-08-12 16:52:54,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eqiv7n/investment_in_palestinian_land/,"Israel had enemies in many Arab countries, but this changed. Countries like Jordan now have contracts with Israel and are even military allies defending Israel against Iran.
This happened due to Israel‚Äôs economic power, prosperity and trade and peace negotiations and the countries aiding each other.
Why does it not work with Iran or the Arab-Palestinian zone‚Äòs people and government?
Because the propaganda seems to play every misfortune on Israel, including poverty, poor economy, no jobs, no perspective.

Yet their governments seems to get no blame for poor decisions, corruption, using foreign aid meant for development or social causes for military expenses and terrorism. Or just focusing more on opposing the west and all Jews in general then everything else, suppressing people by a religious dictatorship and ruling with fear.

But what if Israel could repeat what happened in the past? Gaining the Arab-Palestinians outside of the state of Israel as allies offering better living standards, trade, developmental help - building a state of Arab-Palestine with them for them.

They could build schools as a start - that not teach historical falsehoods or shooting Maschine guns to small kids like the ones payed by UNWRA. They could implement secular education based on science and human rights.

They could invest in Arab-Palestinian companies, help build an economy - show them how they made the best out of the land they got. They could offer jobs in Israel, they could train them to be professionals being able to bring that expertise home.

Probably this solution is not that realistic due to the deep root of the conflict. But I wonder if it has been tried before or if you think it could work."
1eqgpg7,Will there be an attack tomorrow?,2024-08-12 15:28:25,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eqgpg7/will_there_be_an_attack_tomorrow/,"As of writing Fox News came out with this report:

*Iran and its proxies in the Middle East could launch an attack on Israel within the next 24 hours, unnamed sources in the region tell Fox News.*

*‚ÄúOfficials \[in the Middle East\] believe we are reaching hour zero,‚Äù Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst reports.*

*Iran has threatened a major attack against Israel in retaliation for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last month. Israel has not taken responsibility for the assassination.*

*Israel is also bracing for a reprisal attack from Hezbollah, Iran‚Äôs proxy in Lebanon, for the assassination of the terror group‚Äôs top commander, Fuad Shukr, in Beirut, hours before Haniyeh was killed.....*





Putting that aside, the reports are increasing of it being soon. Flurries of diplomatic activity, US mobilisation of submarines etc. 

There's been a large amount of mixed messages sent from the media. Some days reports would indicate that the Iranian would relent... but then if part of information warfare, that is exactly what you would want your enemy to think.

There were reports last week that there would be an attack on the saddest day of the Jewish calendar, Tisha B'Av, which unfortunately is tomorrow. Assuming the Messiah doesn't arrive by this evening, it will be the usual solemn occasion. 

I have trouble, and still do, that the Iranians and their proxies would be this callous as to actually attack on a religious holiday, but I guess that could be naivety. 

  
So what do you think will happen? Will they attack tomorrow? And if so, what will they attack based on what we know now?

And probably just as important, will the inevitable Israeli response then have a domino effect leading to a bigger war in Lebanon and possibly elsewhere? Will US forces get involved?

1eqfsly,Don‚Äôt waste your time with Deradicalization,2024-08-12 14:52:39,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eqfsly/dont_waste_your_time_with_deradicalization/,"NOTE: before I get a whole bunch of what would you do then, I want to say that I don‚Äôt know what the right answer is, I just know this is the wrong one. I will also say nationalism instead of the other word because I don‚Äôt want to get flagged

First, The ideas of German nationalism and Japanese militarism were recently developed, and while certainly massively influenced their politics, they were only around for a decade or so.

Granted, antisemitism was of course a lot deeper seated in Germany and probably wasn‚Äôt fully deprogrammed until a few decades later, but an antisemite doesn‚Äôt necessarily want to invade Poland again. Germany was also split squarely in 2, so that kept each in a different sphere of influence. 

Japan is also different as well. Extreme militarism was also a recent development like the Germans, I also believe that both the German and Japanese public were shielded heavily from the worst atrocities committed by both regimes, they were pretty regretful and it was the end of the story. In contrast, I‚Äôm fairly confident that Palestinians are fully aware of the stuff Hamas does, so exposure won‚Äôt help your case.

I also know the majority of Israelis agree that Palestine is made up, and I know the ‚Äúreeducation‚Äù would probably partially consist of something along the lines of delegitimization of Palestinian identity, and honestly I doubt that would work.

Also, Effective reeducation would require a deep understanding of the local culture, religious beliefs, and social dynamics. Efforts perceived as culturally insensitive or as an attempt to impose foreign values could backfire and further entrench existing attitudes. And given the conduct of Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip, and also Israels failures in the past regarding cultural sensitivity, I doubt that would be taken into account.

I‚Äôm also just thinking here, from what I‚Äôve heard, ‚Äúde radicalization‚Äù I‚Äôve only seen work by itself among a small disadvantaged segment of people, neo n*zis, ISIS members, gang members. And even then, that doesn‚Äôt always necessarily work if you don‚Äôt do it right, 

for example, France one time took a whole bunch of kids who tried to join ISIS and threw them in a room to lecture them about French history. Unsurprisingly, that didn‚Äôt do shit. 

Another example might be the boarding schools in the past set up in USA, Canada and Australia to ‚Äúcivilize‚Äù the populace. As you probably know a lot of issues came from that.

De-radicalizing entire populations I‚Äôve yet to see it actually work without significant real world changes made to actually address said grievances. And frankly, I don‚Äôt think that addressing those grievances would be something Israel would tolerate due to security concerns(which are completely valid) The only way to significantly improve the situation is a large flood of work permits, but that comes at a LARGE price for Israel‚Äôs security, so that‚Äôs off the table as well.

1eq99re,Everyone tried to provoke Jews and now they will do it more worst ,2024-08-12 09:29:57,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eq99re/everyone_tried_to_provoke_jews_and_now_they_will/,"Throughout history, Jews have experienced discrimination and expulsions. Some of this is also recorded in their own scriptures. However, the situation has worsened since the Islamization of the Middle East up until today.
With the advent of Islam, Jews first faced discrimination through the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Muhammad expelled two Jewish tribes from Mecca, and eventually, the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza‚Äîdespite initially helping them‚Äîsuffered the execution of 600 to 900 men, with all the women and children being enslaved. Then, suddenly, Jerusalem became the site of a mosque. No it was not. This is even against the Qur'an 

Considering what happened and what the Qur'an says, it is evident that the Arabs did not want Jews in the region extending from Mecca to Urfa (in modern-day Turkey). Cities/placed like Harran, Damascus, and Sinai are all mentioned in the Qur'an (not really but yeah they stole Jewish words). While Jews were allowed to live in Yemen, Baghdad, and Morocco, access to the western region of the Middle East was restricted. This resulted in Jews finding hospitality in places like Andalusia or Morocco, which effectively prevented them from returning to Jerusalem to rebuild the Temple. The intent seemed to be to erase Jewish history.

However, Al-Aqsa and similar sites did not hold significant value at that time, and according to some travelers, the area around Al-Aqsa had fallen into disrepair. This indicates that Muslims did not particularly care about the area. But when the Jews returned, suddenly, Al-Aqsa gained significance.

For 1,200 years, Arabs and Muslims did everything they could to keep Jews away from the western part of the Middle East. They built mosques and palaces to solidify their presence. But when they saw the Jews returning, Arab nationalists began to use Islam to rally attention against them. The construction of Al-Aqsa was also a misuse of religion; it wasn't truly about Al-Aqsa itself. Instead, the goal was to propagate Arab nationalism under the guise of Islam, a trend that continues to this day.In this conflict, Islam has been turned into a tool‚Äîa shield. Arabs have even misled Palestinians by framing this issue as one of Islamic significance. However, Al-Aqsa is a political building, not a religious one.

Looking at what Jordan did after occupying East Jerusalem further reveals their intent to provoke the Jews. Jordan expelled all Jews from East Jerusalem, barred access to the Western Wall, and damaged Jewish shrines. Jordan seemed to want Israel to take East Jerusalem and then destroy Al-Aqsa, thus expelling Palestinians and inciting a jihad‚Äîa great hate campaign‚Äîagainst the Jews.

Today, relations with Jordan have been restored, so the speculation that such a scenario was possible seems unfounded. For instance, in 1997, Sarit Hadad, a Jewish Israeli singer, even released a popular Arabic album in Jordan.

Nonetheless, Islamist nationalists still aim to provoke the Jews. They want Jews to react poorly; they want there to be no Jews in Palestine. My fear is that one day a Palestinian might even bomb the Temple Mount.

What Muslims fail to realize is that Jews are not naive. Muslims tend to focus on what others do, while Jews focus on what the Torah and Halacha require. The Torah teaches Jews to work hard, so they work tirelessly. It teaches them to seek knowledge, so they pursue it vigorously. Unlike Christianity, which is distinct from Judaism, Jews typically show respect towards Islam and Muhammad, even refraining from voicing strong opinions. Despite the fact that Muhammad killed 600 to 900 Jewish men, Jews generally refrain from disrespecting Muslims.

In addition, Jews are taught to avoid certain discussions, especially those that might provoke conflict. Rabbis and Orthodox Jews often walk away from debates about shrines, preferring to remain silent and not give Muslims any reason for provocation. Some Orthodox Rabbis even try to prevent Jews from descending to the level of provocation that some Muslims might seek. For instance, after Ismail Haniyeh, a Hamas leader, was killed, Orthodox Rabbis advised against celebrating.It is clear what the ultimate goal is: they want to expel Jews from Palestine and might even bomb Al-Aqsa Mosque to achieve this. But the Orthodox community is working to prevent the Israeli state from demolishing it

The entire Old City of Jerusalem must be protected through passport control by Israeli police. There is no other way"
1eq8cp5,The biggest Casualty in war is the Truth,2024-08-12 08:26:32,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eq8cp5/the_biggest_casualty_in_war_is_the_truth/,"How many times have governments lied to hide their crimes? 

The suffering caused by these lies falls on innocent people, who have no power.

A recent report on BBC shows armed Israeli soldiers gunning down an unsuspecting Palestinian border guard:

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd735zvg1q9o](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd735zvg1q9o)

The response from the Israeli government was to claim that the guard (who carried a standard issue rifle on his shoulder) stood in resistance when the Israeli soldiers tried to cross. They claimed that the killing of the border officer was provoked and justified.

While many witnesses issued contrary accounts of what happened, nothing was done about the atrocity ..... UNTIL ..... 

A CCTV footage was presented which captured the entire event.  It shows that the border force officer approached the car carrying Israeli soldiers casually, with his rifly slung over his shoulder. He was not threatening anyone and his rifle was not even pointing to anyone when the agression unfolded.

The CCTV footage shows how the Israeli person (who spoke Arabic to the guard) draws a pistol and shoots the guard. This shooting was unprovoked, unnecessary and unjustified.

The Israeli government knew what their saoldiers had done (they film everything on theor body cams). But when they were asked to account for the actions fo the rogue soldier in question, they issued a statement filled with lies. They assumed they could bury the truth along with the body of the border guard.

This is pure evil and pure cowardice. I have never seen a more one sided battle where a well armed army supported by two of the strongest super powers systematically commit genocide on a nation who literally consist of disposessed and homeless civilians. 

The the biggest sin of all is the willingness of the majority of people to accept the lies that the Israeli government spews to hide their crimes. The biggest casualty in all wars is the truth. Let us not allow these lies to be ignored.

1eq64yu,These solutions have been tried!,2024-08-12 05:56:47,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eq64yu/these_solutions_have_been_tried/,"Their are a few ""solutions"" that people often bring up when discussing the Israel/Palestine situation.  The first is ""The Two State Solution"".  This involves creating two states, one with Ethnic Jews and another with Ethnic Palestinians.  But this has been tried before!  If you look at a map of Ethnic Palestinians, ignoring refugees, you'll find that about 50% of them live in what is today Jordan as ""Jordanians"".  This is because there is no such thing a ""Jordanian"".  The original borders of Palestine included all regions where Palestinians live, including what is today Jordan.  They were separated due to the Irgun, Lehi, and some other stuff we don't have time for, but the thing is that Jordanians and Palestinians were one in the same.  The King of Jordan considered himself King of Palestine, which is why in 1948 the land was given to him.  Gazans are also ethnic Palestinians, but due to its distance from Amman, that land was given to Egypt.  It should be noted that in the years since 1967 Jordan has worked very hard to separate themselves from Palestine, creating a separate culture and national Identity to appease Israel.

So there it was, in 1948, the Ideal 2 state solution that so 2SS supporters stive for.  There as poor treatment of Palestinians on the Israeli side, but other than that; The Ideal 2SS that so many people want had been achieved.  When people say ""May 1967 Borders"" they forget they are asking for something that existed in 1967.

So what went wrong? Well, Israel realized they were powerful enough to conquer the West Bank, so they did.  They just took it, because they could, in June 1967.

This happened because there was far too large of a power imbalance between the Palestinian and Israeli state.  So Israel was able to just take it.

What do we learn from this?  A two state solution won't work if Israel is given a blank check to do whatever it wants from the United States.  This isn't because Israelis are bad, its just, practically unlimited power is not safe with anyone.  The USA doesn't give a blank check to itself, it puts restrictions and a system in place, but they ensure Israel can do whatever they want.  
Think about how much better the world would be if these blank checks didn't happen.  Like, Israel wouldn't have violated international law, and Gazans wouldn't be angry enough to put Hamas in power, Hamas wouldn't be angry enough to attack Israel, Jordan would be an actual Palestinian state, and as Israel reformed from its backward Apartheid state, the situation would be resolved, thousands of lives would be saved.

Even if right now Israel is suddenly left without these U.S offered checks, then you would likely see them begin to follow the Geneva convention, maybe even follow International law!

The fundamental issue is that Israel has the power to do whatever it wants, and no one is there to stop them.  If USA cut aid to Israel, we would see a much better world!"
1epxb4x,Whose land is it really?,2024-08-11 22:24:53,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1epxb4x/whose_land_is_it_really/,"Growing up, I always thought that land belongs to whoever has the bigger guns. Everything else just falls to the side. The whole ""this land is mine, not yours"" argument always confused me because, at the end of the day, it doesn‚Äôt matter who claims it if the person you're arguing with can wipe you out. I‚Äôm trying not to sound cold or insensitive, but isn't that the reality we live in?

Why would I be throwing rocks at my neighbor who has the power to obliterate me? I'd rather start that conversation from a stronger position or not have it at all.

Sure, there's the modern context with international laws and whatnot, but a lot of it seems one-sided. Hamas made a huge mistake attacking that festival, and I don't see what they thought they'd gain from it.

When I look at history and what's happening now, it's clear that having military power is a big deal. In the past, countries and empires took over land through force, and the stronger ones usually pushed out the weaker ones. Even today, power dynamics are still crucial in land disputes. But now, we've also got international laws, human rights, and diplomacy to think about. While military strength is still important, it‚Äôs not the only thing that matters anymore.

This view might seem harsh, but it also makes me think about ethics and international norms. Even the strongest countries often prefer diplomacy over conflict because war is expensive and destructive. Talking things out and finding peaceful solutions can actually work better sometimes. 

So, while power and strength are important, we can‚Äôt ignore ethics, international laws, and diplomacy. The actions of groups like Hamas, in this light, seem desperate and ultimately ineffective. It highlights why it‚Äôs better to approach conflicts from a position of strength but with a commitment to peace and justice."
1eptlm2,The Failure of UNIFIL Forces in Lebanon: A Shield for Hezbollah?,2024-08-11 19:45:23,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eptlm2/the_failure_of_unifil_forces_in_lebanon_a_shield/,"The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was established in 1978 with the aim of confirming Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, restoring international peace and security, and assisting the Lebanese government in regaining its authority in the area. Over the years, however, the role and effectiveness of UNIFIL have come under scrutiny, particularly in relation to its ability‚Äîor lack thereof‚Äîto enforce peace between Israel and Lebanon, especially given the rise of Hezbollah as a dominant force in southern Lebanon.

### UNIFIL's Mandate: A Broad Scope with Limited Action

Under UN Security Council Resolution 1701, [adopted in the aftermath of the 2006 Lebanon War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Interim_Force_in_Lebanon#Mandate), UNIFIL's mandate was significantly expanded. According to the resolution, UNIFIL was tasked with a wide range of responsibilities, including:

- Monitoring the cessation of hostilities.
- Supporting the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) as they deploy throughout southern Lebanon, including along the Blue Line, as Israel withdraws its forces.
- Assisting the LAF in establishing an area free of armed personnel, assets, and weapons between the Blue Line and the Litani River, except for those of the Lebanese government and UNIFIL itself.
- Securing Lebanon's borders to prevent the unauthorized entry of arms.
- Taking ""all necessary action"" to ensure that its area of operations is not used for hostile activities and to protect civilians under imminent threat of violence.

Despite these broad responsibilities, there is overwhelming evidence and concern that UNIFIL has been ineffective in fulfilling its mandate, particularly regarding Hezbollah's activities in southern Lebanon.

### Hezbollah's Use of UNIFIL as a Shield

During the 2006 Lebanon War, the IDF reported numerous instances where Hezbollah utilized UNIFIL positions as shields for launching attacks on Israel. Specifically, Hezbollah fired rockets from close proximity to UN positions on at least 62 occasions, placing UN personnel directly in harm's way due to Israel's responsive bombing tactics. In addition, Hezbollah forces allegedly targeted UNIFIL positions six times during the conflict.

These incidents highlight a critical failure in UNIFIL's mission. Rather than deterring Hezbollah from engaging in hostile actions, the presence of UNIFIL forces seems to have provided Hezbollah with a form of protection, knowing that any Israeli retaliation results in international condemnation due to the proximity of UN forces. This situation raises serious questions about the efficacy of UNIFIL's peacekeeping efforts and whether their presence is inadvertently enabling Hezbollah's military operations.

### UNIFIL's Current Role: A Force in Name Only

In the years since the 2006 conflict, Hezbollah has only grown stronger, amassing a significant arsenal of rockets and other weapons in southern Lebanon. Despite UNIFIL's mandate to assist the LAF in keeping the area between the Blue Line and the Litani River free of unauthorized armed personnel, Hezbollah continues to operate openly in this region, effectively controlling large swathes of territory.

Today, UNIFIL forces are stationed in Lebanon, but their impact on preventing Hezbollah's aggressive actions against Israel appears minimal. Thousands of rockets and anti-tank weapons have been fired by Hezbollah towards Israeli civilians, causing deaths, injuries, and massive displacement. Yet, there is little evidence to suggest that UNIFIL is taking meaningful steps to curb these attacks or to dismantle Hezbollah's military infrastructure in southern Lebanon.

### The International Community's Silence: A Question of Accountability

The apparent failure of UNIFIL to carry out its mandate has largely gone unchallenged by the international community. Despite the clear violations of Resolution 1701 by Hezbollah, there has been little outcry or demand for accountability from the UN or its member states. This raises troubling questions about the role of the United Nations in conflict zones and whether it is truly committed to upholding peace and security or is simply content to maintain a presence without effecting real change.

Moreover, the continued funding and support of UNIFIL by Western powers, despite its shortcomings, suggest a troubling complacency. Taxpayer money from these nations is being used to fund a force that appears to be more of a passive observer than an active peacekeeper. This situation not only undermines the credibility of the United Nations but also emboldens groups like Hezbollah to continue their actions without fear of significant repercussions.

### Why Is Israel Not Demanding UNIFIL's Withdrawal?

Given the ongoing conflict and the apparent ineffectiveness of UNIFIL, it is worth asking why Israel has not demanded the immediate withdrawal of UNIFIL forces from Lebanon. The continued presence of UNIFIL during a protracted and complex war could lead to more casualties among its ranks, which, as history has shown, will be used against Israel in the international arena rather than as a deterrent to Hezbollah's actions.

Israel's restraint in this regard may be driven by a desire to avoid further international criticism or to maintain some semblance of international oversight in southern Lebanon. However, as the situation stands, UNIFIL's presence does little to change the reality on the ground, where Hezbollah continues to operate with impunity.

### Conclusion: A Force in Need of Reassessment

The situation in southern Lebanon calls for a serious reassessment of UNIFIL's role and effectiveness. The failure of UNIFIL to enforce its mandate under Resolution 1701 has not only allowed Hezbollah to grow stronger but has also contributed to the ongoing suffering of civilians on both sides of the conflict. Unless the international community is willing to hold UNIFIL accountable and demand more robust action, the current situation is unlikely to change, and UNIFIL risks becoming little more than a symbolic presence in a region in desperate need of real peacekeeping.

The time has come for a frank discussion about the future of UNIFIL and whether it can still play a meaningful role in maintaining peace between Israel and Lebanon. If not, its continued presence may do more harm than good, both for the people of the region and for the credibility of the United Nations itself."

In response, far-right politicians, including Heritage Minister Amichay Eliyahu and Knesset Member Zvi Sukkot, urged their supporters to protest at Sde Teiman against the soldiers' detention. Sukkot, Eliyahu, and Knesset Member Nissim Vaturi, along with other right-wingers, illegally broke into Sde Teiman, and the Israeli military's Beit Lid base was also broken into by far-right activists as the soldiers were being detained there.

While this event has gained a fair bit of coverage unfortunately it is indicative of a wider issue that Palestinians have been complaining about for many years, we weren't supposed to see this footage, and many similar instances have been occurring for years behind the scenes. Some people in spite of all of this have tried to actually praise Israel due to the fact that these soldiers were arrested, not only ignoring the many Israelis - including prominent Israeli politicians and ministers - who are clearly supportive of these soldiers, but also ignoring the fact that that a number of them have been released and ignoring the fact that it has been happening for a while with no repercussions. This post will attempt to cover the long-standing issue ([this ](https://www.omct.org/en/resources/urgent-interventions/israel-palestinian-children-still-being-tortured-in-israeli-prisons)is an article from 2001) of Palestinian mass imprisonment and torture.

**Mass surveillance and administrative detention**

In order to properly understand the system Israel imposes on Palestinians that leads to mass imprisonment and torture, you need to understand Israel's tactics of mass surveillance and the policy of administrative detention.   
  
Israel's mass surveillance system allows them to locate and identify virtually any and all Palestinians with alarming speed and efficiency. Starting off simple, take Hebron for instance. As the only Palestinian city with settlers in its heart, its residents experience intense surveillance and military presence to protect the settlers. This surveillance includes extensive CCTV, facial recognition systems, and AI-powered weapons, turning Hebron into a digital prison and infringing on Palestinians' privacy and human rights. Organizations like the One Israel Fund support this network by installing cameras and drones.

Soldiers use several overlapping programs to monitor Palestinians. The first, previously unreported system is Red Wolf, used at permanent checkpoints where Palestinians are biometrically registered and assessed against information held on them. Soldiers teach Red Wolf by pairing new faces with IDs and other biographical information.   
  
Second is Blue Wolf, a facial recognition app Israeli forces use in the field on raids or at temporary checkpoints to capture photos of Palestinians.   
  
Third is White Wolf, an app specifically for settlers that allows them to check if Palestinian workers have the correct permits, giving settlers access to what is supposed to be confidential government data. Connecting all of this is Wolf Pack, a database that aims to build a profile of every Palestinian in the West Bank, including information like a person's name, where they live, their family members, car license plates, and whether they are wanted or not. Israeli soldiers are incentivized to compete over who can collect the most data and photos of Palestinians, gamifying the occupation and dehumanizing the Palestinians.

Surveillance and intimidation are also personal, involving phone calls or texts from intelligence officers, and open communication on social media. Israeli intelligence officers use social media to intimidate, direct actions, or inform Palestinians of surveillance. 

Other projects to keep an eye on set to help future surveillance include **Project Nimbus,** a cloud computing initiative launched by the Israeli government in April 2021 to provide cloud solutions for government, defense, and other sectors. Under a $1.2 billion contract, Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services will deliver AI and machine learning services, potentially enabling the Israeli military with facial detection, image categorization, object tracking, and sentiment analysis.

The contract prohibits Google and Amazon from ceasing services due to boycott pressures. Furthermore, these companies are forbidden from denying service to any particular government entities. In 2022, a campaign called **No Tech For Apartheid** was launched in opposition, with over 200 Google workers joining. In March 2024, a Google Cloud engineer was fired after protesting the project, and subsequent protests led to employee sit-ins and dismissals.

Another thing to note is that most of these cameras say in Hebron are made by companies outside of Israel and Palestine. 

Israel's use of **administrative detention** is legally based on the British Mandate's 1945 Defence (Emergency) Regulations, later amended in 1979 to form the Israeli Law on Authority in States of Emergency. This allows for six-month detention terms, renewable without trial, often used when evidence from the security services (like the Shin Bet) cannot be publicly disclosed. In practice a Palestinian can be detained indefinitely without trial, not for any crime committed, but for a supposed intention to break the law in the future. This so-called preventive measure has no time limit. The individual is imprisoned by order of the regional military commander, based on secret evidence they are never allowed to see. Stripped of any legal defense completely for some 90 days, they remain trapped in a limbo of unknown accusations, unable to defend themselves, with no idea if or when they will ever be released, without being charged, tried, or convicted.

Of course it primarily targets Palestinians, including political activists even if they were just involved in peaceful demonstrations. The Israeli Minister of Defense can issue these orders if there's a perceived security threat, with limited judicial oversight, although appeals can be made to the district and Supreme Court.

In the Palestinian territories, Israeli district army commanders can issue such orders, which can be renewed indefinitely. Israel justifies this under Article 78 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, allowing internment for ""imperative reasons of security."" 

Gazans detained by Israel since the 7 October 2023 attack are classified as unlawful combatants, excluding them from rights such as access to a lawyer entirely. By April 2024, 849 Gazans were detained under this classification. 

**Mass Arrests during the Israel-Hamas war**

Since the start of the war, Israel has conducted mass arrests and detentions of Palestinians. Thousands have been arrested in both the Palestinian territories and Israel, based on allegations of militant activity, social media posts, or arbitrary reasons in general.

In the following weeks of October 7th, thousands of Palestinian workers, working on Israeli permits in Israel as cheap laborers, went missing in Israel. Between 4,000‚Äì5,000 Gazans have went missing, of whom 3,200 were released on November 3. Thousands more were arrested in the West Bank and¬†East Jerusalem¬†since October 7. Some 9,000 Palestinians were arrested from the West Bank. As of July 2024, more than 9,700 Palestinians in total were being held in Israeli prisons, per the Palestinian Prisoners Club and even hundreds of Arab-Israelis were arrested. [At least 35 Palestinians have died under Israeli custody](https://archive.ph/adVYu) at the Sde Taiman base alone and it's estimated at least [53 have died](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/07/un-report-palestinian-detainees-held-arbitrarily-and-secretly-subjected#:~:text=At%C2%A0least%2053%20Palestinian%20detainees%20are%20known%20to%20have%20died%20in%20Israeli%20military%20facilities%20and%20prisons%20since%20the%20horrific%20attacks%20by%20Hamas%20and%20other%20Palestinian%20armed%20groups%20against%20Israeli%20civilians%20on%207%20October) in total under custody since Oct. 7. 

**Torture during the Israel-Hamas war**

Here I will go over some notable instances and reports of torture from varying sources.  
  
Several human rights organizations and international bodies have reported on the torture and degrading treatment of Palestinian detainees by Israeli authorities. Amnesty International described the treatment as ""horrifying,"" ""gruesome,"" and ""a particularly chilling public display of torture and humiliation,"" with Secretary General Agn√®s Callamard stating that such actions are war crimes in occupied territories. The United Nations Human Rights Office in the occupied Palestinian territories called for an investigation, noting a rise in arrests and ill-treatment reports.   
  
UNRWA documented numerous instances of torture, including beatings and sexual assault. The Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI) [reported](https://stoptorture.org.il/en/systemic-torture-and-inhumane-treatment-of-palestinian-detainees-in-israeli-prison-facilities-since-october-7-2023-2/) evidence of violence and humiliating treatment by prison guards, documenting nine instances of torture, including sexual violence.   
  
Human Rights Watch [reported](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/01/03/israel-gaza-workers-held-incommunicado-weeks) Palestinian workers from Gaza detained in Israel were photographed naked, attacked by dogs, and dragged face down in gravel. The Wall Street Journal [found](https://www.wsj.com/world/palestinians-describe-beatings-stress-positions-other-alleged-abuses-in-israeli-detention-1129b86f) detainees subjected to psychological and physical abuse, including beatings during interrogations. *Adalah* [reported](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/mar/16/middle-east-crisis-live-aid-ship-unloads-food-in-gaza?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with:block-65f56ea78f08d86e4257df6c#block-65f56ea78f08d86e4257df6c) the widespread and systemic use of various tools to inflict torture and ill-treatment on Palestinians, saying ""We‚Äôre seeing really widespread and systemic use of many, many tools in order to inflict torture and ill-treatment on Palestinians"".

A *Defence for Children International* report included the testimony of an incarcerated child who described, ""Around 18 children were severely beaten, screaming in pain. I saw police dogs attacking them, bleeding from the mouth and head."" The United Nations human rights office reported some detainees were released wearing only diapers. *Addameer* reported that prisoners remained blindfolded and handcuffed during their detention and people were being killed in military camps. 

[Doctors reported humiliation, beatings, and being forced to kneel for hours](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68513408).¬†One released man from Shuja'iyya reported beatings, stating that a female Israeli soldier would beat a 72-year-old man. Another stated soldiers forced detainees to bark like dogs. A twenty-year-old man detained in the West Bank stated that he was blindfolded, beaten, burned with a cigarette, and treated ""like an animal."" Three brothers detained from the Gaza Strip described similar treatment in Israeli prison, stating they were beaten, stripped to their underwear, and burnt with cigarettes. One released man stated, ""They let dogs urinate on us and shoved sand on us. They threatened to shoot us.""

Multiple reports detail both physical and psychological torture. Everything from submersion in cold water, and relentless torture to being starved for three days. According to a report by the Ministry of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs, a detainee mentioned, ""I heard the sound of detainees who are getting tortured and beaten, as they are being cursed on by soldiers.""

In March 2024, as covered by the NYT, an UNRWA report [reported ](https://archive.ph/k7hwQ)instances of torture documented in Israeli prisons, including beatings and sexual assault. Some UNRWA employees [reported](https://www.barrons.com/news/un-agency-for-palestinians-says-israel-authorities-tortured-detained-staff-e55739f8) being tortured to extract forced confessions.¬†  
  
In an April 2024 report, UNRWA [stated](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/04/middleeast/un-israel-confessions-allegations-intl/index.html), ""Male victims reported beatings to their genitals, while one detainee reported being made to sit on an electrical probe."" and that the IDF used torture to force confessions.   
  
In a July 2024 report, the UN [stated ](https://www.unrwa.org/sites/default/files/content/resources/summary_on_detention_and_alleged_ill-treatmentupdated.pdf)that Israel had used dogs and¬†waterboarding¬†on Gazan detainees.  
  
Unleashing dogs on civilians is a [long-held](https://www.btselem.org/beating_and_abuse/20141229_military_continues_to_use_attack_dogs_against_civilians) practice of the IDF.  
  
In December 2023, the¬†*New York Times*¬†[reported](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/13/world/israel-hamas-gaza-war-news#israeli-forces-raided-another-hospital-in-gaza-and-detained-doctors-the-health-ministry-says) that Israel had interrogated medical personnel in Gaza under duress.¬†Gaza‚Äôs Ministry of Health¬†similarly stated that Israeli interrogations of hospital staff were conducted ""under duress"".¬†  
  
Following reports on the physical and psychological abuse of¬†Marwan Barghouti, the U.S. Department of State requested Israel to ""thoroughly and transparently investigate credible allegations of and ensure accountability for any abuses or violations"".  
  
In a letter to Israel's attorney general, a doctor at an Israeli field hospital for detained Palestinians stated, ""Inmates are fed through straws, defecate in diapers and are held \[in\] constant restraints, which violate medical ethics and the law.""

The New York Times also [reported ](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/world/middleeast/gaza-doctors-medical-workers-israel.html)that more than 300 of Gaza‚Äôs health workers are in Israeli detention, per Gaza's health ministry, while others have been detained for a time and then released.   
  
Among the doctors who were imprisoned and died or disappeared include Dr. Khaled El Serr, who simply disappeared after being arrested by the IDF, and Dr. Mohammad Abu Salmiya, who was arrested, imprisoned and released on July 1, Dr. Abu Salmiya said at a news conference that he and others had been subjected to ‚Äúextreme torture.‚Äù His finger had been broken, he said, and he had been beaten over the head repeatedly. His release sparked a blame game among Israeli officials over who sanctioned his detention, but details about why he was held or the conditions he endured remained unclear.

Dr. Iyad Rantisi, a 53-year-old gynecologist who worked at Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, died in custody in Shikma Prison on Nov. 11, six days after he was arrested, the Israeli news outlet¬†[Ha'aretz reported in June](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-06-18/ty-article/.premium/israel-arrested-a-senior-doctor-in-gaza-six-days-later-he-died-in-a-shin-bet-facility/00000190-27eb-d14b-a999-27eb9aea0000).

Save the Children¬†released a [report](https://www.savethechildren.net/news/gazas-missing-children-over-20000-children-estimated-be-lost-disappeared-detained-buried-under) stating, ""Children are also among those recently found in¬†mass graves, according to UN experts, with many showing signs of torture and summary executions"".

In May, a GIZ employee (which is part of the German Federal Government) claimed to have been beaten and abused in an Israeli prison. In March, Baraa Odeh, a Palestinian GIZ employee, was detained for three months without charge and subjected to ""abusive and humiliating treatment."" GIZ vowed to investigate, while Germany's development ministry criticized administrative detention, stating, ‚ÄúThe Federal Government is critical of the practice of administrative detention ‚Äì \[...\] International humanitarian law sets strict limits on this practice.‚Äù The Commission for Detainees‚Äô Affairs reported medical neglect of Palestinian detainees at Ramon prison. In June, allegations of torture emerged from a Palestinian detainee and the family of a mentally unwell man. 

Videos were posted to social media, appearing to show IDF troops subjecting Palestinian detainees to physical, sexual and verbal abuse. Ha'aretz reported that [one such video](https://archive.ph/p0wrh) was posted at around 31 October and showed a group of Palestinian men blindfolded with their hands and feet bound and mostly stripped naked being physically assaulted by uniformed IDF soldiers. The soldiers involved were reportedly being investigated by IDF officials, per a later statement. A Palestinian woman [recounted](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/02/new-reports-confirm-months-of-israeli-torture-abuse-and-sexual-violence-against-palestinian-prisoners/) that about 30 minutes after her husband was arrested by IDF troops she was sent a link to a video on social media, depicting her husband in IDF custody bound and kneeling before a soldier who can be heard yelling expletives in Arabic while kicking him in the stomach.

In a¬†Telegram¬†group created after the 7 October attacks called ""72 Virgins"", by the IDF Influencing Department which had over 10,500 subscribers in December 2023 before it was banned, videos and snuff films of Palestinians being degraded, tortured, killed and mocked with dehumanizing language were posted. In one video two Palestinian men are defaced to be made to look like pigs with the caption exclaiming: ""Here we see the al-Qawsami brothers, who we are sure their mother (who probably conceived them with her brother) is very proud of her breathtaking two roaches.‚Äù and ""Burning their mother‚Ä¶ You won't believe the video we got! You can hear their bones crunch."" among other videos [forcing Palestinians to pledge themselves as slaves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7cV-vY-jMY).

[According to February 2024 UNRWA report, Israeli officials detained and tortured UN staff, coercing them into falsely stating that agency staff had¬†participated in the 7 October attack](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/04/middleeast/un-israel-confessions-allegations-intl/index.html) through beatings, waterboarding, and threats to their families.  
..  
[The allegations of torture came from staff who stated they were forced to make confessions under torture and ill-treatment, including ""beatings, sleep deprivation, sexual abuse and threats of sexual violence against both men and women"" in Israeli detention.](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/02/new-reports-confirm-months-of-israeli-torture-abuse-and-sexual-violence-against-palestinian-prisoners/) 

Israel's official Twitter account even attempted to pretend like a child [was lying ](https://twitter.com/Israel/status/1729763608219775305)about being abused, when there was [plenty of evidence](https://misbar.com/en/editorial/2023/11/29/contrary-to-the-israeli-claims-the-child-mohammed-nazzal-was-tortured) for it. In [another video that seems to have been staged](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-palestine-war-accused-staging-man-surrendering-weapons) released by Israel, Palestinians civilians who were stripped and filmed [recount](https://www.facebook.com/MiddleEastEye/videos/they-kidnapped-us-in-a-house-and-violently-beat-uswatch-the-testimony-of-a-pales/252918734224809/) their harrowing experience following their release.

The¬†World Organisation Against Torture¬†[condemned Israel](https://www.omct.org/en/resources/statements/israel-opt-gaza-international-community-must-act-on-torture-crisis), stating, ""Both torture and the use of any such information violates the UN Convention Against Torture"".

In an interview with¬†Al Araby TV, Palestinian lawyer Khaled Mhajne¬†[recounted ](https://www.972mag.com/sde-teiman-prisoners-lawyer-mahajneh/)a case involving a 27-year-old detainee who was raped, forced to sleep on his stomach, attacked by police dogs ‚Äúand then raped with a fire extinguisher and had the tube inserted into his butt‚Äù.

The extinguisher was then¬†activated¬†to release its contents into the man‚Äôs body, Mhajne said. 

A whistleblower¬†[said¬†](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/middleeast/israel-sde-teiman-detention-whistleblowers-intl-cmd/index.html)that dogs were set loose on sleeping detainees, while sound grenades were thrown at them.

Several detainees also recalled being brought to a separate enclosure that they called the ‚Äúdisco room‚Äù, where they were [forced to listen](https://x.com/itamarbengvir/status/1724522158683013549?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1724522158683013549%7Ctwgr%5Ead471542e4a1e1434a79719a3d638fff089780bc%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronicintifada.net%2Fblogs%2Fmaureen-clare-murphy%2Fisrael-using-its-national-anthem-noise-torture-against-detainees) to extremely loud music preventing them from sleeping. One detainee said the¬†[sound](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-detention-base.html#:~:text=Like%20others%20who,inside%20his%20ear)¬†was so painful that blood began to trickle from inside his ear.

The IDF acknowledged two similar camps to Sde taiman in the West Bank: Ofer Prison and a prison in Atrot. I will go over some important things to note about these three main prisons specifically.

**Sde Taiman**

In December 2023, the Knesset [passed an amendment](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/01/gaza-unlawful-combatants-law-violates-rights) to the Unlawful Combatants Law, allowing the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to detain individuals without an arrest warrant for 45 days. The law imposes strict limitations on judicial review, even more so than the already restrictive administrative detention system used by the Israeli military in the West Bank and Israeli criminal law. According to the 2002 law, the court is required to presumptively accept the Defense Ministry‚Äôs determination that the organization in question is a ‚Äúhostile‚Äù entity and that its members are individuals whose release would endanger State security. These presumptions shift the burden of proof onto the detainee, requiring them to demonstrate that they are not a threat, rather than placing this burden on state authorities, as mandated by international human rights law.   
  
This led to the conversion of a military base into the Sde Teiman detention camp, where detainees are kept blindfolded and handcuffed. The camp includes an enclosure for up to 200 detainees and a field hospital with tents for dozens of handcuffed prisoners.

Sde Teiman is divided into two main sections: enclosures and a field hospital, with an additional interrogation structure. Reports indicate that hundreds of Palestinians from Gaza were detained there, with some dying under unknown circumstances. On 7 March 2024, As of May 2024, approximately 4,000 Gazans had been detained at Sde Teiman, with 70% detained for further investigation, 1,200 repatriated to Gaza, and as I already touched on, 35 deaths reported in Sde Taiman alone.

In May 2024, three anonymous Israeli employees of the Sde Teiman detention camp [spoke to CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/10/middleeast/israel-sde-teiman-detention-whistleblowers-intl-cmd/index.html) as whistleblowers, corroborating and expanding upon reports of abuse and poor conditions revealed by released detainees. The whistleblowers detailed that detainees were kept blindfolded, not allowed to speak or move, and were photographed sitting on thin mattresses surrounded by a barbed-wire fence. Punishments included beatings and being forced to raise hands in a stress position, sometimes zip-tied to a fence for over an hour. Guards conducted nightly searches with dogs and sound grenades, which detainees called ""the nightly torture."" Detainees were given minimal food, consisting of one cucumber, some slices of bread, and a cup of cheese daily.

Several detainees [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-detention-base.html) to UNWRA and the New York Times that interrogators used a metal stick to inflict injury by shoving it in their anus and administered electric shocks, sometimes forcing detainees to sit in an electrically wired chair.   
  
Lawyer Khaled Mahajneh, who visited the camp, described conditions as worse than the infamous Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, citing routine abuse, sexual assault by guards, and deaths from torture. He sought information on Muhammad Arab, a detained reporter, who testified about the abuse and was found to be unrecognizable.

An Amnesty International report in July 2024 included consistent accounts of abuse from Sde Teiman detainees. It featured a 14-year-old child who stated that interrogators beat him, burned him with cigarettes, and kept him blindfolded and handcuffed.

In April 2024, Ha'aretz [obtained a letter](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-04-04/ty-article/.premium/doctor-at-idf-field-hospital-for-detained-gazans-we-are-all-complicit-in-breaking-law/0000018e-a59c-dfed-ad9f-afdfb5ce0000) from a doctor at a field hospital at Sde Teiman addressed to Israel's attorney general, defense minister, and health minister. The doctor wrote that ""inmates are fed through straws, defecate in diapers and are held \[in\] constant restraints, which violate medical ethics and the law."" The doctor alleged that understaffing and inadequate care led to complications and deaths, describing amputations due to handcuff injuries as ""routine."" A separate medical source who visited Sde Teiman corroborated the letter to CNN, also characterizing systemic dehumanizing of detainees and alleging that officials were told to use prisoners' serial numbers instead of their names.

Whistleblowers to CNN echoed previous accounts, stating that wounded detainees were physically restrained to beds, wore diapers, were fed through straws, and were blindfolded. They further alleged that medical procedures were frequently performed by underqualified employees, operations were often done without anesthesia, and patients were refused pain relievers. Some detainees were reportedly arrested in hospitals in Gaza while undergoing treatment. According to the whistleblowers, the medical team was instructed not to document treatments or sign papers, corroborating April 2024 reporting by Physicians for Human Rights in Israel that anonymity is employed to hinder potential investigation. Whistleblowers also stated that patients were shackled to their beds and surgeries were performed without adequate painkillers.

In response to the allegations made by the whistleblowers, the IDF stated that they treat detainees ""appropriately and carefully,"" and that ""incidents of unlawful handcuffing are not known to the authorities."" Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, the military advocate-general, stated that military police investigations have been opened into allegations of misconduct at Sde Teiman.

John Kirby expressed that the US was ""deeply concerned"" by CNN's report but expected to receive ""good answers"" from Israel. Alice Jill Edwards, United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture and Unlawful Combatants, called for an investigation.

On 23 May 2024, Israeli human rights groups petitioned the High Court of Justice to close the detention center at Sde Teiman. On June 5, the Israeli government informed the court that they were planning to transfer most prisoners out of Sde Teiman. However, Amnesty International noted in July that ""little appears to have changed.""

Two Israeli troops at the Sde Teiman camp [have come forward ](https://x.com/academic_la/status/1819519616797860347)with testimonies that they are systematically mass raping and torturing Palestinians that they know are innocent to death:

>Things happen. Bad things. People have been beaten. People have been killed. I saw one person die. People have been sexually assaulted. Yes. Nothing compared to what they did. But we all know we shouldn't be doing it.

>

>They all tell us they are innocent. So we don't believe any of them. But yeah, some probably did nothing wrong. 

**Ofer Prison**

As early as 2010 non-governmental organizations¬†such has¬†Machsom Watch¬†have [reported ](https://web.archive.org/web/20130429231541/http://www.machsomwatch.org/en/ofer_mon_221110_morning)the imprisonment of children in Ofer Prison.¬†A delegation of British lawyers who visited the facilities observed the use of iron shackles on children, which they considered to be in breach of Article 40 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the UN Standard Minimum Rules.  
  
On April 19, 2024, Dr.¬†Adnan al-Bursh, the head of orthopedics at¬†Al-Shifa Hospital¬†in¬†Gaza City, died at Ofer Prison. He had been arrested by the IDF in the¬†Gaza Strip. They did not notify his family and refused to disclose any details about his death. Fellow prisoners who knew him and had been released said that al-Bursh [appeared badly¬†tortured¬†and starved](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-05-12/ty-article/.premium/a-senior-gazan-doctor-died-during-israeli-detention-officials-refuse-to-explain-how/0000018f-6c31-d0ae-adef-edfdd51a0000) before his death in custody. The¬†OHCHR¬†[confirmed](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/05/un-expert-horrified-death-gazan-orthopedic-surgeon-israeli-detention) his body showed signs of torture.  
  
Gideon Levy¬†wrote in¬†Ha'aretz¬†that he asked the Israel Prison Service about the circumstances of al-Bursh's torture and murder, and that the response of the Israel Prison Service was:   
  
""The service does not address the circumstances of the deaths of detainees who are not Israeli citizens.""

**Atarot Prison**

According to [Ha'aretz](https://archive.ph/hN0ji#selection-917.0-1141.137), Israeli police are holding Palestinians in makeshift cages that lack walls, beds, or toilets due to a shortage of prison cells. These detainees, who had their permits to be in Israel revoked when the war began, are reportedly being kept outside a Border Police base in Atarot, near Jerusalem. Despite a court order to cease using this facility, the police continue to do so. The improvised installation, enclosed by temporary fencing and guarded by a lone officer, has not been officially approved as a detention center.

Usually I provide a little more insight from me in my posts but this post is meant to be moreso just informative. There can be no denying it now, the evidence of systemic torture is overwhelming.  
  
This is just part of what Palestinians have been enduring under this system. Palestinians have been condemned to die and suffer relentlessly, and there's nothing they can do now except try and overthrow this state of affairs they live under. They will probably fail in doing so but they will die and suffer regardless. Contrary to what they might tell you on Twitter, COGAT and the Israeli government more broadly do not have morals and do not care about Palestinians as individuals, only as obstacles to the domination of a Jewish-majority state from the river to the sea. It is simple chance from there whether they are allowed to exist as downtrodden subjects of the Israeli military administration for their whole life with nothing but their bare existence to survive with or are condemned to be a death/prison statistic, the threat of the latter fate keeps the former in line, and at any moment, those spared can find themselves in the same tragic position as the poor guy who had something shoved so far up his anus it punctured his lungs.

1epmqbt,Israeli pride and Jewish confidence ,2024-08-11 14:57:15,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1epmqbt/israeli_pride_and_jewish_confidence/,"I've been thinking that Israelis and Jews really spend way too much apologizing for what we are. We need to have confidence in ourselves.

You see what our enemy did on October 7, they surprised attacked us on Simchat Torah. They trained and worked towards this for years, this horrible attack which murdered 1200 Israelis. We know. It was a big thing for them.

But think for a moment what happened after. In three days, we pushed them out of Israel. All this work, all this work from them, everything in their favor, and we reversed it in three days.

What has happened since is the intense aggression for the ceasefire. But there was a ceasefire on Oct 6. Now they are getting throttled. They have been getting throttled within hours of their surprise attack actually, it was already advantage Israel on Oct 7 itself. Now they cry about how evil and demonic and bad Israel is because we are fighting back against this treachery in a war we did not start or want.

We are powerful as anything. We are a powerful people. A warrior people who are one of the strongest people in the world. Perhaps pound for pound the strongest.

Look how our first president Chaim Weizmann talked:

>We will establish ourselves in Palestine whether you like it or not. You can hasten our arrival or you can equally hinder it. It is however better for you to help us so as to avoid our constructive powers being turned into a destructive power which will overthrow the world.

He was the leader of the Yishuv at this time. Not Israel. The Yishuv was like a joke compared to modern Israel. This guy Weizmann was a badass Jew. A confident Jew. He's a leader. He's teaching you how you should act. If he talked this way to the British at the height of their power, why are we entertaining all the others now who are like nipping at our legs?

Jews are an independent, sovereign people with no other people or nation above us. We need to internalize this. There is nobody who has some kind of right to interject in our society. I think it is wrong especially for Christians and Muslims to rule over Jews without their consent, something which they got used to. It's never been their right to rule us without our consent, not for a day.

The freedom of the Jewish people was never up for negotiation or compromise. It is not our fault the world was not able to find any other productive solution to our national question. If the entire world had to be flipped on its head so we can be free, so be it, as Chaim said. We do not accept slavery because it is convenient for other nations.

>Instead of excessive apology and instead of turning our backs to the accusers ‚Äì as there is nothing to apologize for, and nobody to apologize to ‚Äì it is long overdue to respond to all current and future accusations, reproaches, suspicions, slanders and denunciations by simply folding our arms and loudly, clearly, coldly and calmly answer: Go to Hell!

Israeli founding father Ze'ev Jabontinsky has some wise words here. Another badass Jew. He's a guy who emitted Jewish pride with everything he said:

>Even in distress the Jew is a prince. No matter if a slave or a tramp, You were created son of kings, Crowned with the diadem of David.

This is what we are. We are a deeply ancient people who reconquered our homeland. We reconquered Jerusalem. Martin Luther wrote:

>A Christian should be satisfied and not quarrel with the Jews. But if you think you must or desire to talk with them, do not say more than this: ‚ÄúDo you hear, Jew, do you know that your principality together with the temple and priesthood are destroyed now for 1460 years? For this year, as we Christians write after the birth of Christ 1543, it is exactly 1469 years, and is thus going on 1500 years since Vespasianus and Titus destroyed Jerusalem and expelled the Jews from it.‚Äù On this little nut let the Jews bite and dispute among themselves as long as they want to.

So sorry Martin Luther.

They will gaslight you to extreme levels to try to convince you that you are something lesser, to accept your mediocrity. Even 500 years ago they did this.

But the Jewish people are the people who wrote the Bible, architected Islam, and gave religion to most of the world. They win Nobel prizes (and now Olympic medals) far disproportionate to their population. They contributed to all manner of human civilization. In science, in art, in politics, in philosophy, in all things at such a ridiculous level, an astonishing level.

This is who we are. If you are Jewish this is your family legacy. If you by reading the description of what the Jewish people are, think this is ""Jewish supremacy"", that's more of a personal issue then anything else. It's Jewish pride, and Jews have a right to pride of their rich history.

We need more confidence. We need more pride. And we will win. Because we are the Jewish people. And that's what we do. Am yisrael chai."
1epkb5c,Israeli reaction to the alleged rape by 10 IDF soldiers epitomises why I'm no longer pro Israel,2024-08-11 13:03:32,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1epkb5c/israeli_reaction_to_the_alleged_rape_by_10_idf/,"_EDIT:_ As so many of you seem to be misunderstanding the title, let me make it clear that I was pro Israel around the mid 1990s when I was in my teens. Suggesting you can discern everything there is to know about me from my reddit history seems painfully terminally online to me!!

It is undeniable that there was sexual violence committed by some of the perpetrators of the Oct 7th pogrom. 

There is no question that these acts need to be condemned in the most emphatic manner that language will allow and, where possible, the rapists need to be brought to justice one way or another.

Leaving aside the debate about whether these were acts of opportunism by some very sick individuals or if rape was a premeditated and/or systematic tactic of the wider attack, until recently I would have thought that the statements made in the opening paragraph represented the attitude of virtually everyone who wasn't already a rapist or considering becoming one. 

But it turns out that for some people, it's only true as long as the rapists aren't Israeli, and/or especially if the rapists' victims are Palestinian.

On the 29th of July, [10 IDF soldiers were arrested after being caught on security footage raping a male Palestinian detainee](https://theintercept.com/2024/08/09/israel-prison-sde-teiman-palestinian-abuse-torture/#:~:text=Ten%20Israeli%20soldiers%20were%20arrested,filmed%20himself%20during%20the%20incident.) and the reaction coming from Israeli society has been, for lack of a better word, _*WILD*_... if not unsurprising, at least not for me.

From [lawmakers](https://wrap.substack.com/p/israel-debates-the-right-to-rape) and [TV anchors](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-journalist-retracts-call-for-policy-of-sodomizing-palestinian-terror-suspects/) openly making arguments in defense of sexually abusing prisoners to [protests trying to shield the rapists from justice](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-idf-palestinian-prisoner-alleged-rape-sde-teinman-abuse-protest/) to [a bizarre appearance of one of the alleged rapists on TV in a balaclava defending his actions](https://youtu.be/8viWxYiinPk?si=fwFRj68s_CYB9mh6) to in-studio applause, I have to ask - how is it that a society that was so outraged by it's own getting raped will also protect and make excuses for it's own rapists, apparently because the victims are Palestinian.

I hasten to add that (obviously) not everyone in Israel thinks like this. Unfortunately however the voices of those who do not have been completely eclipsed by those who do. Anti-Palestinian racism isn't even confined to the right wing anymore - seems to me it's been completely normalised, most obviously (but not exclusively) evidenced by the incessant efforts to ascribe collective guilt to them in order to justify bombing and killing them.

There will be those among you who are way too dyed in the wool and would still be supportive of Israel even if you could be convinced it was genociding Palestinians or if they had nuked Gaza. If you fit that description, I won't lie, I'm surprised you're still reading.. and I'm not sure there is anything I could say that will ever change your mind.

To the rest of you who support Israel but haven't (yet) sacrificed your humanity on the alter of Zionism I ask you, how do you defend this?"
1epj6pz,The key to lasting peace in Gaza: the Philadelphi corridor ,2024-08-11 12:03:43,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1epj6pz/the_key_to_lasting_peace_in_gaza_the_philadelphi/,"The key to lasting Peace in Gaza: the Philadelphi corridor


The war goes on, and I do not think it will end until all hostages are released, and Hamas‚Äôs capabilities to fire rockets are demolished, along with their top leadership.

It is my sincere belief that attempts to fully destroy Hamas is impossible. Simply because at the core of Hamas is fundamentalist Islamism, which the Gazans seem to ascribe too. Plus, an indictrination where Jews are reviled, and forever the cause of every ill. Whether you call it an ideology, idea, religion is all the same, it seems most Gazans share it and are indoctrinated into it. You can‚Äôt remove it unless you kill or displace large swathes of the population, which would not be humane. If Hamas didn‚Äôt rule in Gaza after the war, it would be ruled by an organization with a different name, but to all intents and purposes the same as Hamas 

If you are not inclined to repeat this war in 10-20 years, it seems to solution would be this:

Control the Philadelphi corridor. Along with controlling access to the Mediterranean, and the borders to Israel, you would end the chance of getting in sophisticated weapons. Egypt were supposed to do this. But, anyone who knows hiw Egypt functions know 2 things; they are both incompetent and insanely corrupt. Bribes are deeply embedded in Egyptian culture. There have probably been quite a few Egyptian officials who are now very rich in return for allowing Hamas to smuggle in Iranian weapons through their border. 

This means that Gaza can be as hostile as they want. But, they will be bereft of the tools necessary to be a threath or do any serious harm. It would be very difficult to get in new weapons in large amounts. Even assault rifles would be tough.

A buffer zone on the border to Gaza, mined and heavily surveilled, would also need to happen. The developments in AI could probably reduce cost with robotic defenses/drones. Besides some operations to ¬´mow the lawn¬ª, Gaza could then be left more alone again.

Free to develop as they see fit. But without any military capability that could threathen civilians.

1ephynm,What is Israel‚Äôs long term view of relating with its neighbors?,2024-08-11 10:48:55,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ephynm/what_is_israels_long_term_view_of_relating_with/,"Israel is supposedly surrounded by enemies who want to destroy it. These enemies are Islamic fanatics who Israel says want to destroy it. How does Israel hope to solve this problem in the long term, is it via permanent conflict and subduing all these nations? 

Israel, especially under Netanyahu right wing government and an increasingly right wing society, does not see any value in making peace with these numerous enemies (never mind that these enemies have all sat on their hands and watch Israel exterminate Gaza). 

The US pays Egypt and Jordan enough to keep these despotic regimes quiet enough for Israel. Syria and Yemen are dead countries and even Iran is on back foot while Netanyahu pushes for war with the ayatollahs. 

It seems to be the long term strategy for Israel‚Äôs existence in that region to prop up despotic friendly regimes or wage war against unfriendly ones. But how sustainable is this strategy as a generational solution to this problem? Does it make Israelis feel better to exist in a permanent state of belligerence with neighbors? 

Why is there is no genuine effort on the part of Israel to make real peace with its enemies, despite Israel‚Äôs strengths which make that very possible. You make peace with your enemies, not your friends. And Sisi and his likes who ignore the popular sentiments will not remain there forever to protect Israel. 

Does Israel have a goal and vision to conquer and rule over the entire region in order to exist, because that seems to be a logical consequence of its current approach to this issue. "
1epb38w,"Evidence of the Support for Zionism, Specifically Conquering a ""Greater Israel‚Äù/""Promised Land""",2024-08-11 03:28:54,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1epb38w/evidence_of_the_support_for_zionism_specifically/,"I have created this thread to gather substantial evidence that sheds light on the level of support, or lack thereof, within Israel or among Israelis for the concept of conquering and expanding to the biblical ‚ÄúGreater Israel.‚Äù This notion, often referred to as the ""Promised Land,"" has been a topic of intense debate and speculation. My aim is to determine whether this belief is widespread or even the dominant view within Israel, or if it represents the perspective of a small, perhaps fringe, minority.

The questions I'm hoping to answer are: How prevalent is the belief in expanding to a ‚ÄúGreater Israel‚Äù? Is this an idea that resonates with a significant portion of the Israeli population, or is it primarily held by a limited group? Moreover, how do political, religious, and military leaders within Israel align with this belief? Are there concrete examples of this ideology influencing Israeli policy or actions on the ground?

To ensure that the discussion remains focused and relevant, I request that all evidence shared should be from the last 20 years. Statements or actions from elected religious, political, and military leaders would be particularly valuable. If possible, please provide additional context, such as the percentage of the vote these leaders received, to help demonstrate the extent of their support and influence within Israeli society.

Other forms of evidence could include official government documents, policies, or legislation that explicitly or implicitly support the expansionist ideology. Academic research, think tank reports, and credible media articles that analyze this issue could also provide valuable insights. Lastly, if there have been any public opinion polls conducted on this topic, those would also be an excellent way to gauge the overall sentiment among Israelis.

I believe that a comprehensive collection of evidence will help us better understand the current landscape regarding this sensitive and significant issue. Thank you in advance for your contributions."
1eozg94,"If you're advocating for 2SS, you should ask yourself what went wrong in Gaza",2024-08-10 18:08:29,108,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eozg94/if_youre_advocating_for_2ss_you_should_ask/,"What do the people even mean when they say ""[two state solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution)""?

Well, if you ask, they will tell you that mean Palestinian state should be created, officially recognized, admitted into the UN, Israel should end its occupation, etc. Which is fine, if you think all of that sounds like a great idea, more power to you. *But why do you call this a ""solution""?* Why do you think it will end the conflict and not make it worse?

Let's for example look at the ongoing war in Europe between Russia and Ukraine. Why isn't anyone suggesting ""two state solution"" as way out of this conflict? Obviously because it makes no sense: Russia and Ukraine are *already* two separate states, most people agree that's how it should be, yet we still have a war. 

Once you start thinking along these lines, you immediately realize that war between two sovereign, internationally recognized states is entirely common thing. So how is this a ""solution"" of Israeli Palestinian conflict? What do we miss?

If you ask, people are probably going to tell you ""yes but when we propose Palestinian state, we mean that there will be an agreement signed between two sides which would officially declare the conflict resolved"". Thus, a *solution*. OK.

Well, for one thing, this adds another important constraint to the proposed ""2SS"" framework, because as we know Palestinians have plenty other demands in addition to just territory and statehood. This is not the point of this post though, so let's say for the sake of this discussion such a comprehensive peaceful agreement is indeed signed. Is that it?

Going back again to the war in Europe, in fact, Ukraine and Russia signed just [an agreement like that back in 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum). It had all the same components people expect from future Israel/Palestine peace agreement: mutual recognition, security guarantees, borders, settlement of outstanding disputes, everything. So what happened? Why do we have a war?

Of course, there were always people in Russia who never considered Ukraine as a fully legitimate state and Ukrainians as a separate nation. It's just that in 1994 they weren't in power and even if they were, they didn't have enough resources to attack Ukraine, until in 2014 they were and they did. That's all. No agreement could ever prevent this development.

We all understand that no matter what Palestinian leaders might sign, there will be many, if not majority, of Palestinians who wouldn't be happy with this and will start plotting how to use newly acquired territory and international status to get ""justice"" by destroying Israel and ""returning"" to their homeland Zionists stole from them. 

---

Now, if you get up until this point in a discussion with a proponent of ""two state solution"", they will probably tell you something along the lines ""every state has its extremists but normally it doesn't go to war just like that because most people don't want war and state has its own enforcement mechanisms to contain extremists"".

*This is the gist of it*. A ""state"" is usually understood to mean that residents of this state have their own internal life and internal politics which is more important to them than taking a revenge, however justified, against their neighbors. We see this playing out every day. This is why Iran is now reportedly having second thoughts on starting a war with Israel, this is why border between Israel and Syria has been mostly peaceful, this is why China hasn't invaded Taiwan yet, and so on. For a state to attack Israel is a big threshold to cross, because Israel is not exactly defenseless and in all likelihood the life in that hypothetical state will never be the same, to put it mildly.

That, if you think about it, the only reason why people see ""two state"" as *solution*. Let's give Palestinians something of their own, something they won't want to lose, a life which will be more important to them than ""Nakba"" and all Zionists in the world combined. Then there will be peace.

---

And this finally brings us to Gaza post 2005 withdrawal.

Because while not officially a sovereign state, Gaza had *a lot* of what's described above. For the first time ever, Palestinians had a territory of their own, with its own power struggles, economy, education, politics, etc. I am sure many of the readers think of pre-war Gaza as some kind of hellhole, a place people barely survive in, an ""open air prison"" where everyone only thinks how to get food tomorrow. Well, it wasn't. In [this post](https://new.reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/18rn9yf/pictures_from_prewar_gaza_there_are_also_some/) I collected a few pictures and [videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/18rn9yf/comment/kf25xc1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from Gaza, please take a look; there are many more you can (still) find online. Gaza city was a beautiful place, and Islamic University of Gaza was amazing. 

Since the last large-scale conflict in 2014, many neighborhoods were rebuilt (often with Qatari money, which people for some reason now blame Netanyahu for as allegedly ""funding Hamas""). There was a whole new generation growing up who only ever saw an Israeli on their smartphones. Furthermore, amazingly, Israel and Hamas kind of learned to coexist. After 2014, regular escalations were becoming less and less destructive and bloody. Egyptian mediators learned to quickly resolve the occasional issues. More and more Palestinians were saying they actually wanted Hamas to turn their attention to administering Gaza (or be replaced with someone who would). The theory that independence fosters peace *was working*.

Until one day it wasn't.

---

I know, *I know*, that many of you are now jumping up to tell me why exactly this happened and what went wrong. It's all Israel's fault! Israel never actually wanted peace and that's why they supported Hamas in Gaza to split Palestinians national movement! The whole withdrawal was just a trick to preempt Palestinian statehood! This is ""illegal blockade""! Israel still controlled Gaza after withdrawal! Israel killed thousand of Palestinians in these 17 years! Israel was still an occupier in WB! Settlements kept expanding! Israel was controlling every gram of food and water coming into Gaza to make sure Palestinians only have bare minimum to survive! How *dare* you asking why Palestinians fought back? What else could they do? WWYD?

You will forgive me if I am not going to give here detailed response to each one of these claims. Almost of them are either plain wrong (for example, Gaza produced almost all water it needed, Israel only supplied a very small amount), blame Israel for entirely normal behaviour for a sovereign nation (such as playing politics or import/export restrictions) or swap cause and effect (pretending that blockade was not a result of aggression from Gaza but a reason for it). That's not really the point.

When people propose ""two state solution"", it's entirely unrealistic to expect that both nations will have warm and harmonious relations from day one. The opposite is true. Relations will be extremely tense for a long time. If some steps Israel might take to protect its security, even if you disagree with them, could ruin the peace just like that, how do we expect this to work? Is the plan here to simply see the peace crumble, immediately blame Israel and walk away?

The only justification behind ""two state solution"" which makes sense is not that Palestinians are suddenly going to love Israel once they get their own state, but that while hating Israel they'll still value welfare of their national state and their personal lives more than any military retaliation against Israel. So why did this fail in Gaza?

It's nice to tell yourself ""I love both nations, I want peace, I am pro-two state solution"", no questions about it, but if you want to be honest with yourself, you have to ask yourself ""if two state solution solution is so great, what went wrong in Gaza?"" and try to find an answer which is not just blaming Israel for everything, *not because it's necessarily wrong, but because it's pointless*; if your understanding of ""two state solution"" is not compatible with Israel as one these two states, it's not worth much.

After the massacre of October 7, continue advocating for ""two state solution"" as if nothing happened is intellectually dishonest. Gaza was not a perfect experiment at Palestinian statehood ‚Äì far from it ‚Äì but nothing which happens in real life is ever going to be perfect. A failure at something doesn't preclude us from trying again and perhaps succeeding in the future, but *only* if we're ready to learn the lessons."
1eorfd8,Opinion: the story around Mohammed - Jerusalem was fabricated and further expanded to provoke Jews,2024-08-10 12:05:25,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eorfd8/opinion_the_story_around_mohammed_jerusalem_was/,"A few days earlier, I had shared a religious story about Jerusalem and the rest of Israel as Palestine. This is part two of it and a whole lot more sensitive. So I want to say, this story is not meant to insult Islam but rather to protect Islam from people using this religion

The event around that Muhammad went to Allah is described as Isra and Miraj. Al-Isra 17:1 is the only piece of the Qur'an that really talks about it 

""Glory be to the One Who took His servant ÀπMu·∏•ammadÀ∫ by night from the Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque whose surroundings We have blessed, so that We may show him some of Our signs. Indeed, He alone is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing.""

What is striking is that the Quran describes this event only in general terms, with no explicit reference to Jerusalem. The concept of the ""Farthest Mosque"" (Masjid al-Aqsa) is often associated with the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, although there was no mosque in Jerusalem at the time of Prophet Muhammad

This begs the question:
Why is Jerusalem so strongly associated with this event in later Islamic texts and traditions? It is important to note that the hadiths that make this association were not written until hundreds of years after the Prophet's death, a time when Jerusalem was already under Islamic rule and the Dome of the Rock had been built. This may open up the possibility that these stories were developed to serve religious and political purposes at a time of intense conflict.

In addition, it is interesting to consider why Muhammad would be brought precisely to a place that was a site of great conflict at the time. This raises questions about the possible political motives behind these later interpretations of the Isra and Miraj

In modern times, we see how these narratives are sometimes used to fuel political and religious tensions. It is therefore important to consider how and why certain religious narratives have evolved over time, and what impact this has on interfaith relations today

I strongly believe the story around Jerusalem was made up on purpose

And as I said, I have every respect for Islam. I am heavily against the demolition of the Al Aqsa complex. We'll see what the Messiah will do with the area"
1eon1mk,What do you think about the one state solution?,2024-08-10 07:14:43,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eon1mk/what_do_you_think_about_the_one_state_solution/,"I know the most popular talked about thing is the two-state solution but honestly what good does that do in the long run? I feel like resentment, hatred, just animosity, and tension overall will only continue between the two countries and its peoples. It feels like it‚Äôs leaves the door more open for future conflict. 

It feels to me like the one state solution is the best choice in the long run. A new country should be born, one where everyone can respectfully move freely to whatever region they‚Äôd like. It should have a new name (a tribute to the land & something that connects the two people), a new flag because I know damn well neither side would want the other‚Äôs name or flag. A bilingual country and a government run by both Israeli and Palestinian diplomats. 

I know this take is really optimistic and I don‚Äôt know how realistic it is, and I get that in this scenario surely the early years won‚Äôt be easy as tensions will be the highest, but in the long run, if this new country/the one state solution promotes love, a brotherhood, forgiveness, and tolerance, I feel like in a couple of decades, it‚Äôll unify the people and the hatred won‚Äôt be so big. I just feel like it‚Äôll be less likely for a war between the two peoples to break out with a one state solution especially if this country promotes what I mentioned. I know there‚Äôs also religious tensions being a big part of why it may be difficult in the early years, and maybe I have too much faith in humanity but I still feel like if this new country promotes peace, love, tolerance, and the other qualities mentioned, eventually things will settle down.

1eoaqqu,The West Bank could be an actual safe zone,2024-08-09 20:55:11,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eoaqqu/the_west_bank_could_be_an_actual_safe_zone/,"On the matter that Gazans have nowhere to escape the war, perhaps Israel should allow for camps to be built in area C of the WB for Gazans, especially for familes with small children. We know that Israel is capable of vetting individuals for affiliation with Hamas, so I earnestly believe that the security risk would be minute. Removing civilians from the battle field would vastly simplify operations for Israel - strikes frequently have to be called off due to civilian presence - and most importantly of all, save countless of lives. Gaza already has the highest population of child amputees which is beyond tragic. They never chose to live under the Hamas regime. Israel, by controlling the West Bank, has the ability to do something about it. Even if Gazans may be ""Hamas's responsibility"", Israel also prides itself in having ""the world's most moral army"".



The only reason I see that Israel wouldn't implement this is that it heavily contradicts the settler policy, as it would increase the West Bank's population by perhaps more than a million Palestinians, of whom a large amount could stay after the war is over. That is a pretty shameful...



Such an initiative could be facilitated, and would be gladly financed by countries like the UAE. It can start off with a few thousand of the most vulnerable people and be scaled up in accordance to how well it works out. All Israel has to do is allow it. Every displaced persons camp less in Gaza is one less place for Hamasniks to disguise themselves, and less civilians makes hostage extraction operations much easier.



Has anybody proposed this course of action already? I haven't heard about it at all."
1eo9q44,Muslims have fought non Muslim states for a  millennia BEFORE the State of Israel existed Edit,2024-08-09 20:13:36,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eo9q44/muslims_have_fought_non_muslim_states_for_a/,"Muslims have fought against separate non Muslim states for a  millennia BEFORE the State of Israel was founded.  Before 1948. Before WW2.  The common response to this is that only the 75 years since the formation of the State of Israel matters.  However the historical pattern of a proselytizing religion matters.  The ‚ÄúRight of Return‚Äù was an 1949 invention of Swedish diplomats who admitted in a UN Report it is a refugee standard that has never been applied to any other UN Refugee program particularly when a country didn‚Äôt want the refugees.

This is documented in a recent book ‚ÄúThe War of Return‚Äù by Schwartz and Wilt.  Israel‚Äôs acceptance of the UN Partition Plan for Palestine, Resolution 181 (II), triggered the WAR OF INDEPENDENCE.  UN Diplomatic efforts before, during and after the War of Independence were stalemated by Arab Negotiator‚Äôs religious views that Islam could not be subservient to any other religion in Palestine. This led UN envoys to believe Arabs would never accept their failure to defeat the Jews in 1948.  A failure Arab scholar‚Äôs at the time said was worse than the loss of Spain in 1492AD when Granada was conquered by the Catholic Armies of Isabel of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon (Schwartz and Wilt p73).  Coincidentally, prior to 1900, return to Spain was a frequent Islamic prayer.

The pre-planned Nakba, the ‚Äúethnic cleansing of Palestinians‚Äù is a myth frequently used to justify attacking Israel and refusing to recognize Israel‚Äôs right to exist. Hyperbole like ‚Äúethnic cleansing‚Äù isn‚Äôt credible just because the terminology worked 40 years ago in Bosnia. This was not the same. Jewish military plans used in 1947 (made public in 1982)and verified by contemporary UN reporting showed Arab villagers that didn‚Äôt attack Jews in 1947 (estimated at 200,000) were NOT REMOVED by Jewish forces.  600,000 Arab descendants from 1948 actually enjoy full Israeli citizenship today and serve in the IDF.  However, in 1947 Arab fighters mixed into most villages including peaceful villages.  Being dramatically out numbered, Jewish forces couldn‚Äôt occupy most villages. It became impossible to let most villagers stay. In 1952, the UN estimate of refugees was 725,000.  An earlier number of 800,000 was reduced because of Jordanians, Egyptians and Lebanese who claimed to be refugees in order to receive aid from the UN.

Over 6,000 Jews died in the war along with thousands of Arabs. When a 106 innocent Arabs were sadly murdered by Jewish settlers in 1947 (Page 86), Arab media hoped to energize villages to fight the Jews by wildly exaggerated reports of mass slaughter, rape and defiling mosques. This of course ignored the numerous slaughters of innocent Jews including the well documented The Hadassah Convoy Massacre of 78 doctors and nurses burned alive in a medical column that was given permission to reach a Hospital.  Right after the exaggerated Arab reports appeared, 200,000 to 300,000 additional Arab villagers ran for their lives without Jewish forces be present. It‚Äôs ironic that Arab propaganda was one of the big reasons Palestinians left.

The ‚Äúright‚Äù to return was a unique  invention by Swedish diplomats. It has never been a standard for post WW2 refugees. Rather, the standard was to integrate them into the country they arrived at. To create a homogenized population was thought to avoid chaos. Certainly not forcing them into a country that didn‚Äôt want them.  Were Muslims in Pakistan give a right to return to India? Visa versa?  The Swedish diplomats (who admitted later their bias for Arab governments) felt it was the only way to avoid more violence (p106).  The Swedes also felt Jews should be more friendly and accommodating to those promising to kill them. Lessons of the Holocaust were not top of mind for the Swedes.

Even though there were vigorous debates about letting villagers return, Israel eventually denied Palestinians the right to return after 1948. The biggest roadblock was that Palestinians and Arab governments kept promising to murder Jews to get Palestine back. In 75 years since 1948 the promises of murdering Jews proved accurate. Arab diplomats in 1952 openly discussed planting a ‚ÄúFifth Column‚Äù of terrorists inside Israel using the Right of Return.  A few thousand humanitarian returns were eventually allowed for separated families over 30 years. 

Why does this sound so disturbingly like the Palestinian conflict today? IMO it is rooted in a millennia of Islamic/Arab intolerance. Any delusional Western view that Palestinians will ever peacefully accept a separate state goes against literally a thousand years of history. Palestinians will  never accept a separate Palestinian state. Hamas has stated ‚Äúthe existence of  A Jewish State means admitting the divine right of Islam to rule has failed which we will  never accept‚Äù.  

With 50 Islamic countries and only one Jewish state. Israel is no threat to Islam. "
1eo5fu3,Finding it difficult to support Palestine nowadays,2024-08-09 17:18:20,274,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eo5fu3/finding_it_difficult_to_support_palestine_nowadays/,"I don't know where else to put this. 

To preface, I consider myself left-leaning. 

One thing that has been on my mind for the better part of 6 months is how incredibly radicalized my friends (who are also leftists/left-leaning) have become in recent months regarding Israel/Palestine. It's sort of off-putting to me how quick they are to blindly support Palestine and condemn anyone who doesn't follow suit.

I took a 9-month social media break at the beginning of Dec. 2023 for my own personal reasons (unrelated to Israel/Palestine) and am just starting to come back now, but seeing all sorts of radicalized posts from my friends is making me consider taking more time off. Everything they post is so angry and so accusatory and straight up hostile. I get that there are times when anger is necessary, but saying people are zionists or evil for choosing¬†*not*¬†to post about Israel/Palestine isn't exactly helping the cause. In fact, it's started to have the opposite effect on me where my knee jerk reaction is to wonder if I should support Israel instead out of pure spite, despite my actual thoughts and options on the matter. 

For the record, I don't like what Israel's government is doing, but at the same time, I just can't bring myself to fully support Palestine either. Maybe I do support Palestine in my own small way, but by using my friends as a comparison, it doesn't feel like I'm doing enough. Maybe I'm just jaded. I don't know. I'm afraid my friends will drop me if I tell them how I really feel because of how radicalized they've become.

I understand that being in the west gives me the privilege of not having to deal with the conflict firsthand, and for that I'm very grateful. But being angry all the time is exhausting, and I don't think it should be considered morally wrong to want to take a step back for a bit.

I'm so tired."

Don't get me wrong. I think it's horrible that so many minors died. But I think it shows you, no comparison needs to be made between the horrors of October 7th and the events that perceeded them. It shows you that the IDF is not targeting innocent civilians, and it also shows you about the education for terrorism and violence in Palestinian society from a young age which in my opinion is the true root of the conflict. 
You are more than welcome to ask me for more information about each one of these cases and I will gladly provide.

1envrwh,Palestine is an ancient term. Why fight it? Embrace it.,2024-08-09 09:56:07,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1envrwh/palestine_is_an_ancient_term_why_fight_it_embrace/,"Over the past months, I have seen so many posts of coins, maps, and money displaying ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù being used to defend the idea that Palestine is ancient.

Why do we fight this rather than embrace it?

They are correct that the term Palestine has been around for a long time‚Äîsince at least 135 AD. That‚Äôs almost 1,900 years ago! Which‚Ä¶ if you think about it‚Ä¶ is quite funny. Why?

Because from 135 AD roughly until the 5th century, the area was still majority Jewish despite heavy Roman persecution. With the Byzantines in the 5th century came renewed persecution and the Christians became the majority. Palestine didn‚Äôt become majority Arab and Muslim until well after the conquest by the Islamic Army and fall of Jerusalem in 637/638 AD.

So what they‚Äôre really pointing out is that the term Palestinian is old enough that the original Palestinians were the Jews. üòÖ For like‚Ä¶ 300 years the Jews were the first Palestinians. 

mic drop.


PS I know this is a bit tongue in cheek tangentially related to very serious and sad current events‚Ä¶ this is my attempt at an inescapably true and humorous point as a way of handling my frustration with all the unbelievable antisemitism that has come to the fore‚Ä¶ previously fun/interesting pages on facebook, for example, have become cesspools‚Ä¶ a map of ancient Israel is met with cries of ‚ÄúBS!‚Äù ‚ÄúZionist propaganda!‚Äù and worse‚Ä¶ I was so dumbfounded just now by one fellow claiming that Israel is a fake state and that the Jews therein are fake Jews. The guy‚Äôs profile made him out to be a white guy from Australia so I exasperatedly asked what led him to believe that (wondering to myself, ‚Äòwhat is it this time?‚Äô). One of his primary pieces of ‚Äòevidence‚Äô is that ‚Äúgenetic testing is banned in Israel.‚Äù Like what?! How does that follow‚Ä¶ where does that even‚Ä¶? 

So I responded with the suggestion that he may be thinking of a law passed in 2000 which protects genetic privacy. And assured him that Israelis have a vested interest in genetics so as to be on the lookout for unhelpful recessive alleles. Dude remained steadfast and then said something about Ashkenazim being fake Jews. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Like‚Ä¶ it is just so relentlessly absurd.

How do y‚Äôall handle the stress?"
1ensg2v,"I see so many people calling for a ""ceasefire"" in Gaza but what exactly do they mean by that?",2024-08-09 06:10:29,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ensg2v/i_see_so_many_people_calling_for_a_ceasefire_in/,"There are no longer any largescale gun battles between the IDF and Hamas. Hamas has no territory from which they can launch missiles or gather a significant fighting force together. The tunnel networks are largely destroyed with no significant emergences resulting in IDF casualties having happened in months. In light of recent assassinations abroad Hamas is also now decapitated for all intensive purposes leaving local warlords in charge of remaining cells of armed Hamas (if any) to fend for themselves.

So I guess what I'm asking is what sense does it make to call for a ""ceasefire"" when the war is now over and has turned into a longterm occupation of the area? 

I also see people asking for the US to end it's military and financial support for Isreal. Something Biden has supported and Kamala Harris has shown no interest in pursuing lately given her recent cold response to the protestors at her speech. Do people actually think the occupation will somehow just spontaneously end if the US no longer provides missiles for Iron Dome or the offensive missiles used against hezbollah in lebanon? Do people asking for that assume that the Israelis can't make their own arms to continue offensive and defensive capabilities after support would be terminated? I'd just appreciate if someone explained their thought process there with regard to what results you are expecting to actually get if the US does terminate all support..

Help me to understand where you are headed with this in the future? I really do want to understand your position and I'm not trying to discredit your views by asking these questions."
1enqewp,Land claims education for peaceful coexistence,2024-08-09 04:10:23,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1enqewp/land_claims_education_for_peaceful_coexistence/,"Assuming that the main reason for conflict revolves on issues of legitimacy of ethnic and religious historical claims of each people, and that a mutual understanding and acceptance thereof would pave the way for future peace,   
  
**how could such education, awareness, be spread to everyone's minds in both sides?**   
  
Could governments discuss a plan in order to do it? Or would the politicians already know about such solution but ignore it in favor of a one-sided total territorial domination?

**Notes:**

There is a somewhat known resistance of both groups to accept the other's claims. On the Palestinian side, there is ignorance or denial of Jewish archeological evidence at least by its population. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkLs-yOi9gQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkLs-yOi9gQ) There are also other less known historical claims for Arabs in Israel prior to Islam, alongside Jews.

We know that a Machiavellian solution could be that Israel would dominate all the territory (annex all) and then impose education, culture, like older empires might do, even expelling or eliminating rebels. Such solution would be unethical (apartheid etc.) and apparently geopolitically unfeasible. The same could be done by the other side.

Could the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and even in Gaza make possible that schools could get such education (in a utilitarian perspective)? There are ethical issues on this proposal, i.e., breaking UN agreements, etc.

There is also a perspective held by Muslims in the region that all the territory belongs to Islam, as can be seen in Hamas's statute and in the Axis of Resistance. This could be an obstacle for Palestinians (especially religious extremists) or their government to accept the propagation of Israeli claims, or any other idea of peacefully accepting Jews in the land.

Some people consider the historical claims insufficient to defend the right of inhabiting a land; however, both parties fight because of that.

I know that some notes could be debated, but they're relatively common knowledge. Please don't take offense on the ideas. They're only raw conjectures. I'm mostly interested in ideas to promote understanding and future peace between both peoples."
1enngd0,"Rape is never, ever ok.",2024-08-09 01:40:38,440,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1enngd0/rape_is_never_ever_ok/,"This shouldn't be a debate. Claiming it wasn't rape and that it was just ""torture with heavily sexual undertones"" doesn't make it better. It makes it more vile, more disgusting and reprehensible.

There. Is. No. Justification. For. Rape. Even against *supposed* rapists. Even if you believe that the very person who was rapped in the video is proven to be a rapist. It doesn't matter. Pro-israel people who are downplaying or in favor of this are messed up and lost any moral high ground. Right now, Israeli media is having a serious debate on how raping prisoners of war (some who may even be teenagers) is morally correct. If you're even debating it, you're messed up. There is something very, very wrong with you and you should seek treatment. 

If you are ok with anyone ever being raped, this means you don't care about rape and rape victims. If you even consider rape as some kind of poetic justice, it just shows you don't actually care about women, LGBT people and children who are raped. Because rape isn't about sex, it's about power. Guards who rape prisoners are fathers who rape daughters. They're opportunistic sick people who shouldn't b allowed in any culture.

""Oh, but I'm pro-israel and I'm not in favor of rape"" yeah, congratulations for doing the absolute minimum we should expect of any decent person. If you are pro-israel, you shouldn't just be not in favor of rape. You should be bloody furious that there are collective rapes happening in prisons. You should be very loudly and angrily anti-rape. You should watch their court cases like a hawk and be ready to fight like hell to make them responsible. 

""But Palestinians raped israelis on October 7th"". Yeah probably. It was messed up and unforgivable. It still isn't ok to defend rape. The moment you're ok with raping your enemies, you have no pretention of being civilized or superior.

There's exactly one kind person who thinks rape is ok in certain situations. They're called rapists."
1enjzwl,I served in the Navy for three years near Gaza and participated in Operation Protective Edge. AMA,2024-08-08 22:58:52,80,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1enjzwl/i_served_in_the_navy_for_three_years_near_gaza/,"I served in the Israeli patrol fleet called the Daburim between 2013 and 2016. The Daburim is part of [Shayetet 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shayetet_15) and is subdivided into three squadrons 914, 915, and 916 based in Haifa, Eilat, and Ashdod respectively. As part of [Squadron 916](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shayetet_15#Squadron_916) we were tasked with protecting Israel from various threats in the Mediterranean between the border with Egypt and Herzliya (slightly North of Tel Aviv) with our primary focus on enforcing the maritime blockade on Gaza, preventing costal infiltrations into Israel, and guarding offshore assets such as Israel's natural gas rigs.

Unlike some of the other patrol squadrons which see less combat, Squadron 916 uses the most advanced patrol ships in the fleet to carry out its mission which include the [Super Dvora Mk III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Dvora_Mk_III-class_patrol_boat) and [Shaldag-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaldag-class_patrol_boat) patrol ships.

Excluding boot camp and basic training, I spent the majority of my service on the 830 AD Dvora Mk III patrol ship (pictured). It holds a crew of 10-12 people and is equipped with the [M242 25mm Bushmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M242_Bushmaster) chain gun on the [Typhoon weapon platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Weapon_Station), a .50 [M2 Browning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_Browning) machine gun, three [FN MAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN_MAG) machine guns, [M16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M16_rifle)s, and other offensive and defensive weapon systems. The ship itself has a displacement of 72 tons and is capable of reaching speeds in excess of 45 knots (83 km/h) in optimal weather conditions. (While it is significantly out of date at this point, you can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeSQq7bZX0w) to get a better understanding of the ships uses as well as see what it looks like from the inside. it should also be mentioned that this is the exact ship that I served on.)

The crew itself is split into two groups, seamen and mechanics. While there is some overlap between the two, seamen are primarily tasked with general upkeep, rope work, and weapon maintenance while the mechanics largely dealt with the engine, generator, and similar systems on the ship. While I was a seaman I learnt how to assist the mechanics in addition to my regular duties and was eventually promoted to [Bosun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boatswain) which gave me additional responsibilities such as being in charge of the deck crew during towing, refueling, and helicopter rescue operations.

In 2014 I participated in [Operation Protective Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War) and was later involved in various joint operations until I completed my service in 2016.

While I obviously won't be able to answer each and every question due to operational security reasons, I'll try to be as thorough as I can especially in regards to day to day life on the ship, interesting things I have experienced, and any other aspects of the role you may wish to learn about including its intersection with my personal political views and effects on the conflict.

As for why I have decided to make an AMA, Reddit just released a new AMA feature which will be available to all members and I wanted to give it a test run to see how well it worked. If everything goes well we are interested in trying to get high profile public figures to participate in future AMAs on this sub which should be quite interesting if we can get them on.

Edit: I‚Äôm not sure why the AMA says it ended but I am still taking questions for those who are interested."
1enci71,Settlements in the WB; How can you have a Palestinian State?,2024-08-08 17:50:48,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1enci71/settlements_in_the_wb_how_can_you_have_a/,"
Unfortunately, the sub doesn‚Äôt allow for a pic.

Follow this link for an easy, but a tad outdated (not changed too much though) map.

https://www.btselem.org/download/settlements_map_eng.pdf

Question for pro-Israelis; how can a Palestinian state be viable, and without much conflict, if the settlements remain as they are?

Pro-Palestinians: what do you think should happen with the settlements? How should Israelis living there be compensated if they leave? (Or should they not leave, or not receive anything from the infrastructure they built?)

Reason why I‚Äôm asking is because the Camp David proposal of 2000 seemed to include settlements and highways to them criscrossing the West Bank. I do believe most consider the failure of the Camp David talks to be that of the ¬´right to return¬ª, which the Palestinians seemed not to discard entirely. It didn‚Äôt seem to fail because of the continued existance of these settlements, even deep into the WB. Leading me to believe that there was some kind of mutual agreement that they could actually remain, if other concessions were given.

My personal opinion is that conflict will continue unless you have a firm border. If I was world dictator I‚Äôd just cut a line encompassing some of the larger settlements near Israel, and giving back some empty land to a future Palestinian state. Then build a wall. Dissecating the WB with settlements and highways would lead to hundreds of years of continued conflict from Jihadis and extremist settlers.

I don‚Äôt really get how Israel can compete with a Palestinian population multiplying their numbers through births in the WB‚Ä¶keeping settlements there must surely be a losing prospect demographically down the line?

1ena78r,Genuinely curious what does a good form on Palestinian resistance look like.,2024-08-08 16:19:06,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ena78r/genuinely_curious_what_does_a_good_form_on/,"Under The Geneva convention, occupied people have the right to resist their occupiers through violent and nonviolent means. 

Imagine for a second Hamas does not exist (like in the West Bank) and the people are still facing cruel and unjust(Illegal) occupation and having their land usurped. Is there a model of violent resistance that would be considered moral and justified? 

I want you to really think about this. If you comment with something like ""well if they didn't rape people that would be nice"" That's just reading into the narrative of Hamas. I don't want to know what it should not be. I want to know what it should be from a Zionist opinion. 

Please note: 

*I will not respond to any comment that gives me ""well if only they didn't.."" or anyone who's denying that there is a brutal occupation currently happening in the West Bank*. 

Also if you're on the side of the illegal settlers please don't bother to provide an input. It would be irrelevant because you've already committed to being a validated aggressor.

Context and Question:
If you were a Palestinian citizen whose 10-year-old child was abducted by the IDF, who regularly faced reads from soldiers who locked them in a room of their house in the middle of the night, who experienced settler violence on a daily basis with the military occupier only there to guard the settlers who were illegally occupying your land. 

What would be your resistance? How would you defeat the occupation force from your land?

I want a detailed plan on what a moral Palestinian armed resistance would look like. That achieves two objectives. 1) returning the Palestinian hostages currently in Israeli prisons. 2) removing the occupation forces and the settlers from Palestinian lands based on the 1948 borders. 

Again: I WILL NOT ENGAGE IN ANY CONVERSATION THAT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE QUESTION HEAD-ON.

edit: I saw a mod comment about a few rules that advise users not to discourage open discussion. 

I just want to clarify that my statements are not a strict set of rules for the answer. You can answer whatever you like. However if you are unable to stay within these parameters it will be difficult for me to be able to have a discussion with you because our belief sets Will be completely different. 
If we are discussing bird's nests and I believe that birds are a subspecies of fish, then you need not answer my question because clearly our reality paradigms/ facts are not compatible enough for us to have a conversation."
1en2lae,Israel: Why did the Christian world decide to give the Jews a country?,2024-08-08 10:35:13,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1en2lae/israel_why_did_the_christian_world_decide_to_give/,"I'm going to list all the reasons I can think of what led the Christian world, led by the UN, to allocate and partition the British Mandate of Mandatory Palestine, offering a certain % of it to the Jews in 1948. I'd like to know which reasons were the most significant ones.

* **Moral**: guilt and empathy after centauries if not millennias of persecution by the Christians, starting with antisemitism, increasing with pogroms and culminating in the holocaust.
* **Imperial**: politics and strategic reasons, like establishing a foothold in the Middle East. Note that this can apply to both the British Empire and the Russian Empire, which were at odds with each other.
* **Ideological**: Zionism successfully influenced Western politicians through ideology, money (bribery) or otherwise.
* **Antisemitism**: put the Jews in a hostile environment and led them fend for themselves. I've heard this so I'll include it, though I don't want to believe it's true.
* **?**: If you have other - let's hear it.

I suppose the real answer is probably a mix of everything, but maybe some reasons were more or less important than others.

Bonus topic: some argue that the British Empire and the UN had no right to partition the land because it wasn't theirs. The Arabs viewed it as their own, looking back at their history in the region. Ultimately, The British Empire and the West defeated the Ottoman Empire and ""won"" the land, but the Arabs reject this idea and maintain Palestine was theirs. Along the same logic, the Jews can look back at their history and make a similar claim about Judea and Samaria. Did the British Empire and the UN had the right to partition the land? Are the Arabs right to reject the Western sovereignty at the fall of the Ottoman Empire?"

So, I have some questions and am hoping that someone can answer them unbiasedly with facts. I have no ill intention with this post, I am just trying to be more informed.

*  So, I read that there was an existing ceasefire deal that had been in place for years, before the events of October 7th. If this is true, why did Hamas violate this ceasefire? 
* I also researched and found that Hamas won an election in 2006 that led them to power. Why did Palestinians vote for them? What did they promise? Did the Palestinians know that Hamas was a terrorist group?
* Why hasn't a two-state deal been reached? I read that there had been proposals for a two-state deal before, but the terms were unfavorable, and Palestine rejected them, is this true? If so, what were the terms of the deal that made it unfavorable?
* Aside from the governments, do the Palestinian and Israeli People support a two-state solution?
* Is there a simple answer to how Israel and Palestine reached this point? Why is there even a conflict?
* I've read claims that Israel notifies Palestinians about upcoming military actions and gives Palestinians time to leave the area before they attack, however Hamas corrals people into areas where Isreal is due to attack in order to increase the casualty count to make Israel look bad. Is this claim warranted or completely false? 
* Is Hamas stopping aid from reaching the Palestinian people? If not, who is responsible for aid not reaching Palestinians? Is Hamas supporting the Palestinian people or doing anything good for them?
* Is Israel's response justifed? Is the IDF killing innocent civilians and sexually assaulting Palestinians?
* Is Israel comitting a genocide?
* How does this conlict end? "

Also, the whole saying ‚ÄúOne/a few bad apple ruins the bunch,‚Äù is flawed because it could be applied to pretty much any group to call them bad.

A leaked video from israel channel 12   showing Israeli soldiers sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee from Gaza in the notorious Israeli detention camp Sde Teiman has emerged .Footage shows soldiers hiding actions behind riot shields, and is believed to be the incident that led to their arrest 

The palestinian person   was taken to a field hospital at Sde Teiman with ‚Äúa ruptured bowel, a severe injury to his anus, lung damage and broken ribs"",About 4,000 Palestinians have been detained from Gaza in Israel since October. Most are detained and interrogated in the enclave, but many are brought to Sde Teiman, even if they are a non-combatant.
Torture, rape and murder have all been reported as rife at the facility, one of several facilities where Palestinians have been held.

When nine soldiers were arrested on Monday, it prompted an invasion of two military bases by politicians and demonstrators, mostly representing far right parties, who were furious about the arrests and described the men as heroes.The group surged past police, and the IDF had to call in extra units from other areas to restore order. An increase in threats against the Military Advocate Gen Brig Gen Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi prompted the military to step up her security.At the closed hearing on Tuesday, military prosecutors requested an extension of the men‚Äôs detention to Sunday. One man was released without further charges

The detentions are the first time Israel has charged soldiers with abuse of Palestinian detainees, but they come after months of reporting by the UN and multiple media organisations into widespread abuse of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

Interesting to note Sde teiman is still operational with Palestinian being detained with no explicit reason on why their being held. The video is extremely disturbing I would caution people to watch it."
1emg0s6,The Nakba,2024-08-07 16:16:20,98,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1emg0s6/the_nakba/,"So before I start this post I want to say that I do not minimize the importance of the Nakba to the Palestinians or the gravity of that event in history, I do not deny that many thousands were expelled in the process.

I want to talk about what led to the Nakba and the term itself, who coined it and what was the meaning of the term when it was originally coined.

From the Israelis side we call this the war of independence and from the pro Palestinian side we call it the Nakba.

The war broke out immediately after the partition plan which the Jews accepted and the Arabs refused, the plan was to govern the Jews 55% of the land for a Jewish / Arab state, most of the land would have been barren desert land, and 45% of the land to an Arab state (without any barren land).

The Arabs immediately waged war against Israel with the sole intent of committing genocide against the Jews or at the bare minimum kicking all of them out, we know this because we have their leaders quotes from the time 

A few examples 

Mufti Amin Al husseini 
Our funamental condition for cooperationg with Germany was a free hand to eradicate every last Jew from Palestine and the Arab world. I asked Hitler for an explicit undertaking to allow us to solve the Jewish problem in a manner befitting our national and racial aspirations and according to the scientific methods innovated by Germany in the hands of its Jews. The answer I got was: The Jews are yours""

""The Arabs would not suffice with preventing partition but would continue fighting until the Zionists were annihilated and the whole of Palestine became a purely Arab state""

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine#:~:text=Haj%20Amin%20al%2DHusseini%20said,until%20the%20Zionists%20were%20annihilated.%22

Fawzi al-Qawuqji

""We will have to initiate total war. We will murder, wreck and ruin everthing standing in our way, be it English, American or Jewish""

‚ÄúThe battle between the Arabs and the Jews is a total battle, and the only possibility is the annihilation of every Jew in Palestine and all Arab countries‚Äù

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fawzi_al-Qawuqji

Abd al Rahman Azzam

This will be a war of extermination and moentous massacre which will be spoken of like the tartar massace or the Crusader wars.

Travelinisrael video about it

https://youtube.com/shorts/T3aflY9XGUU?si=PKG3idGB6WgF5EWs

The Jews at the time knew that the Arabs don‚Äôt want to let them have any amount of land as the Arabs looked at Jews as unequal to them, as in all Arabs countries at the time the Jews were dhimmis, the Arabs couldn‚Äôt accept Jews looking at them in eye level and would not accept any Jewish sovereignty in the land, we know that because 10 years prior to the partition plan there was the peel
commission which would have given Jews 18% of the land, the Jews obviously agreed and the Arabs refused (which proves that this was never about land), 

The Arabs gathered their armies and marched against Israel, in doing so they also told the local Arabs who didn‚Äôt pick up arms, to flee so they can take care of the Jews for them and then they could return to their homes.

The Arabs were feeling they are unbeatable with their united front against the Jews and after losing they felt such shame and humiliation that they named it Nakba or ‚Äúthe disaster‚Äù.

Constantin Zureiq, who coined the term ""The Disaster"" (The Nakba), was clear in real time that the disaster is ""Seven Arab states declare war in an attempt to subdue Zionism, stop impotent before it, and return on their heels"". The Nakba was the failure to defeat the Jews in war.

So the first time we see the word Nakba used in the context of the conflict it was not about losing their homes, it was not about losing land, it was about the shame they felt for not being able to subdue the Jews and stop them from fulfilling their national aspirations.

I think that today many people use the term as it‚Äôs what they were taught form young age and it very well may have evolved to mean other things but I think it‚Äôs important to remember that the Muslim world mentality of associating losing with shame is still the leading factor in most of the aspects in this conflict, much like Iran threatening Israel today for hurting it, it‚Äôs not about the death of any one person, it‚Äôs the humiliation that must be avenged to clear their name and show they are powerful, they feel their dignity was hurt and this is the main driving force and fuel in their hatred.

1embotx,Conjecture: Palestinians gain nothing by insisting on freeing the entirety of Palestine,2024-08-07 13:23:53,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1embotx/conjecture_palestinians_gain_nothing_by_insisting/,"In my view, a Palestinian state from the river to the sea, with no Jews in between, would have a very similar standard of life to a state only in the OPT.  That is because the territory of Israel proper possesses no real advantages to improving life conditions.  The OPT have plenty of water and fertile land, as well as undeveloped land to accomodate a growing population, and through Gaza would have access to international trade.  Further, the West Bank has many historical cities and sites to attract tourism.  The only thing realistically gained from ""freeing Palestine"" is undoing the generational trauma of being expelled that Palestinians carry since 1948, and it seems that's what Palestinians are truly fighting for.

That begs the question - is that fight worth it?  Considering that most of the UN has already granted Palestine recognition within the '67 borders, and that it would be unthinkable to get the Israelis to absolve their country, striving for the more realistic 2SS seems like a vastly more redeemable struggle.  I believe that the current objectives of Palestinian nationalism come at way too big a cost, namely, the prosperity that Palestinians would be enjoying if they had their own state in the remaining 20% of historic Palestine, even if it means conceding that their grandparents' trauma will never be reverted.

The fight to move 30km westward from one desert city/village to another is not worth foregoing a good life in the 21st century.  The Palestinian national cause, as is, is doing orders of magnitude more harm to Palestinians today than the Zionists did to them in 1948."

I consider myself neutral in this conflict. I‚Äôm Australian and have no specific culture or religion.  
I try to keep updated on the situation in Palestine/Israel when I can. My personal stance is mainly that I disagree with war and think there are ‚Äòbad eggs‚Äô on both sides. I don‚Äôt believe I know enough to necessarily take a ‚Äòside‚Äô. 
I‚Äôm really interested in hearing from those who don‚Äôt support Israel and their reasoning as to why. And no, I‚Äôm not referring to the full blown ‚Äòpro-Palestine‚Äô opinions. In fact, I would particularly like to hear from those who are Jewish or Israeli, or have a personal connection to the current conflict. 
Yes, there are the obvious reasons such as the large number of civilian deaths, which is truly awful. But more specifically, what I‚Äôm keen to hear about is more so if there are other reasons (prior to the escalation that occurred on October 7th) that cause you to disagree with Israel, whether it be political, historical or something else. 
Whilst we can‚Äôt ‚Äôput aside‚Äô the war taking place at the moment, I would like to learn more about what has lead to this point. 
I seem to read a lot on Reddit about why people dislike/disagree with Hamas, which I can certainly understand. However, I don‚Äôt seem to see as many opinions/comments on here around why people disagree with Israel specifically. 

Note (for context); I try to be conscious in my learnings and hear from all perspectives."
1em9pwn,European and Islamists Pro Palestinians are in my view ironic and hypocritical,2024-08-07 11:49:22,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1em9pwn/european_and_islamists_pro_palestinians_are_in_my/,"1. I am talking about only a certain group of people who support Palestinians. So this is not about Palestinians, nor is it about the entire pro-Palestinian community. It is purely about a group of people who are Pro Palestinian. This is mainly about European and Islamist pro Palestinians like Turks, for example. So as long as you're not actually an Islamist or a Palestinian or a Turk or an Arab or whatever who doesn't think this way, don't feel attacked. 

2. I have nothing against Palestinian people or Arabs. I have nothing against Islam. I respect your beliefs but there is some criticism I have against. And if we discuss I will even say ""Prophet Mohammed"" out respect

3. There are statements like ""Qudus is ours"" and ""Temple Mount is our first qibla,"" suggesting that Jews have no right to these places and we should leave Palestine. 

4. For Jews, Yerushalayim and the Temple Mount are as sacred as Mecca and the Kaaba are for Muslims. Our prayers are directed towards this Temple Mount, where the main temple stood and where the Jewish religion originated. Imagine a Christian coming to Mecca, building a church there, and turning the Kaaba into a monument within that church. How would you feel in that situation? This illustrates the sensitivity and importance of these places to us, similar to the sanctity that Mecca and the Kaaba hold for Muslims.

5. We are even still saying that if we want a two-state solution, Hebron must be in the hands of the Palestinians. While Hebron is equal to your Medina. Our patriarchs are buried here. Our father, the first Jew, Avraham along with Yitzhak, Yaaqov, Sarah, Rivka and Lea is buried in this city. For Jews, this is the second holiest place. And besides that. Mount Sinai in Egypt is the place where HaShem gave Moses the Torah but even from the current laws and rules Israel has withdrawn. But can you imagine Arafat now falling into the hands of a Christian country?

6. I respect the Dome of the Rock, the Al Aqsa Mosque. The existence of Palestinians in Hebron as about Israel. Certainly still, I sometimes believe that Arabs from Jaffa or Beer Sheva also have the right to return home, although it is a difficult to impossible job due to political reasons. But still, I want you to read this and think about a Christian authority in the Hijaz.

I'm a Noahide and Jews are my ach and achot. I will never accept that some Muslims can talk like everything is and will be only theirs. Accept that Jews are also exist "

What makes the main difference is the extremely efficient PR department that puts a spin on even the most deplorable acts, and a very efficient system of paying off politicians in Westen countries to support the policy. 

*According to testimony received by Euro-Med Monitor, groups of ten to twenty Israeli civilians at a time were permitted to watch and laughingly film Palestinian prisoners and detainees in their underwear while Israeli army soldiers subjected them to physical abuse, including beating them with metal batons, electric sticks, and pouring hot water on their heads.*¬†

For years we've been hearing about how Arabs are just victims of western imperialism, that the source of all their troubles is rooted in outside interference, that European colonialism is the cause of their misfortune etc etc.

When you look at history, Muslim dynasties were actually some of the biggest colonizers, exploiters, and slave traders ever. The time that Muslim Arab countries were under foreign rule is just a small part of their history, not the norm.

For example, from 636 to 2024, Lebanon and Syria were under non-Muslim rule for only 23 years (excluding some coastal areas during the Crusades). Egypt was ruled by the British for 84 years since 640. Even Algeria, which was colonized by the French for 132 years, has been under Muslim rule for about 1,400 years since the Arab invasion in the mid to late 600s CE.

Edward Said was one of the most damaging Arab intellectuals of the 20th century - using nonsense words and meaningless phrases, he adopted Western excuses for the dysfunction of Arab societies and further fueled the scapegoating of the West to deflect from their own malfunction.

The Palestine cult eagerly adopted these narratives and further built on them to scapegoat Jews for the failures, inadequacies, and horrible choices made by Palestinian society.

These days we see these nonsense phrases repeated ad-nauseam - colonizers, imperialists, invaders; the national-scale psychological projection and self-victimization has destroyed whatever prospects Palestinians had for a bright future."

I came across this old quote by checking out some historic info on the prelude to the war of 1948. For context, the quote comes from Abdul Rahman Azzam, the Arab League's first secretary-general, who was heavily involved in the prelude to war, and the war itself.

I feel the mentality portrayed in this quote is quite familiar to what I have seen from some factions today, when talking to their internal base. It of course differs when they speak to the West, having adopted their language.  

What do you think? Do you think this would still resonate today? 

¬´Abdul Rahman Azzam Pasha spoke to me about the horrific war that was in the offing‚Ä¶ saying:

""I personally wish that the Jews do not drive us to this war, as this will be a war of extermination and momentous massacre which will be spoken of like the Tartar massacre[10] or the Crusader wars. I believe that the number of volunteers from outside Palestine will be larger than Palestine's Arab population, for I know that volunteers will be arriving to us from [as far as] India, Afghanistan, and China to win the honor of martyrdom for the sake of Palestine ‚Ä¶ You might be surprised to learn that hundreds of Englishmen expressed their wish to volunteer in the Arab armies to fight the Jews.

""This war will be distinguished by three serious matters. First‚Äîfaith: as each fighter deems his death on behalf of Palestine as the shortest road to paradise; second, [the war] will be an opportunity for vast plunder. Third, it will be impossible to contain the zealous volunteers arriving from all corners of the world to avenge the martyrdom of the Palestine Arabs, and viewing the war as dignifying every Arab and every Muslim throughout the world ‚Ä¶

""The Arab is superior to the Jew in that he accepts defeat with a smile: Should the Jews defeat us in the first battle, we will defeat them in the second or the third battle ‚Ä¶ or the final one‚Ä¶ whereas one defeat will shatter the Jew's morale! Most desert Arabians take pleasure in fighting. I recall being tasked with mediating a truce in a desert war (in which I participated) that lasted for nine months‚Ä¶While en route to sign the truce, I was approached by some of my comrades in arms who told me: 'Shame on you! You are a man of the people, so how could you wish to end the war ‚Ä¶ How can we live without war?' This is because war gives the Bedouin a sense of happiness, bliss, and security that peace does not provide! ‚Ä¶

""I warned the Jewish leaders I met in London to desist from their policy,[11] telling them that the Arab was the mightiest of soldiers and the day he draws his weapon, he will not lay it down until firing the last bullet in the battle, and we will fire the last shot ‚Ä¶""

He [Azzam] ended his conversation with me by saying: ""I foresee the consequences of this bloody war. I see before me its horrible battles. I can picture its dead, injured, and victims ‚Ä¶ But my conscience is clear ‚Ä¶ For we are not attacking but defending ourselves, and we are not aggressors but defenders against an aggression! ‚Ä¶""

The Israeli government has established a network of settlements in the West Bank, which the international community largely considers illegal under international law. These settlements, along with the construction of military checkpoints, barriers, and movement restrictions, have severely impacted the daily lives of Palestinians, limiting their access to essential resources, healthcare, and education. In Gaza, the situation is even more dire. The Israeli blockade, implemented as a security measure in response to threats from Hamas and other militant groups, has led to widespread poverty and a severe humanitarian crisis, with restricted access to goods, services, and freedom of movement.Supporters of Israel's policies argue that these measures are necessary for ensuring the country's security in the face of ongoing threats and rocket attacks from Palestinian militants. They view the military presence and the blockade as vital for preventing terrorism and protecting Israeli citizens. However, critics argue that these actions violate international law and human rights, perpetuate the occupation, and undermine prospects for a two-state solution. They contend that the expansion of settlements and the harsh conditions imposed on Palestinians fuel resentment and violence, making peace increasingly difficult to achieve.

 While I imagine some people probably support them for the large majority of folks in the middle and left, It seems like the world is on fire with idiots. 

Keeping that theme in mind what does the future of Israeli politics look like. It seems like the far-right government is trying to engage wars on multiple fronts by conducting assassinations within sovereign nations amongst others things. While it might please some in Israel my gut says the large majority must not be game for The current government provoking all out war in the region? 

Or is the general sentiment It's the region's fault? The ""If-olny-muslims-wanted-peace"" talking point.

Would special relevance to Palestine if the IDF could not destroy a few thousand militants in an area the size of LA airport, what chance does it have against the military capabilities of the likes of Hezbollah and Iran? Not to mention the tens of militant groups created as a result of the US war on the region (then backed by the same netanyahu) 

Genuinely curious whether people on this thread think engaging in the regional war is to the benefit of Israel. Whether it can win or not is probably a deeper more tactical debate.

1elme7y,How Palestinian propaganda actually hurts the Palestinian quest for statehood,2024-08-06 16:34:07,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1elme7y/how_palestinian_propaganda_actually_hurts_the/,"One of the longstanding dynamics that prevents, in my opinion, meaningful peace and movements for peace from taking hold is Palestinian propaganda. Truth, sadly, often takes a backseat to demonizing jews, erasing jewish history, and amplifying any voice or story - no matter how unlikely - that paints Israel as the epitome of evil.

Hardly something new, this has been going on for decades. In the 90s there was propaganda about how Palestinians shouldn‚Äôt have gum manufactured in Israel because it contains chemicals to make muslim women infertile. At the same time, it also increases sexual appetites as to undermine Islamic morals. Even worse, this evil gum (which was also available to Israelis) was designed to wreak havoc on new Palestinian children who happened to be born in spite of the gum‚Äôs magical infertility powers. The source for this rumor? The Palestinian Authority. The rumor was so entrenched in Palestinian society it was written about in the New York Times and Washington Post and other publications.

After 10/7, the propaganda has gone into overdrive. The ‚Äúhospital massacre‚Äù that wasn‚Äôt, not to mention any event where anyone dies (even if all Hamas figures) is now instantly labeled a massacre. Are people who died in a bombing Hamas fighters or civilians? It doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs a massacre and an evil attack.¬†

People will often say that Hamas hasn‚Äôt held elections for 18 years. True. What this means though is that an entire generation in Gaza was raised under Hamas rule where Hamas completely dictated the culture and education of the region. When you see school plays where 4 year olds act out killing jews to crowds of cheering parents, it‚Äôs easy to see why kids growing up in Gaza over the last 15+ years have a visceral hatred for Jews. When you examine the textbooks and entertainment programming, it‚Äôs easy to see why Jews are viewed as the sole problem for all Palestinians, never mind the fact that Israel left Gaza entirely in 2005.

If you spend time in Palstinian message boards or Telegram channels, the propaganda has a similar effect. It strengthens the idea that peace isn‚Äôt something that should be pursued, but rather dismissed in the interest of completely taking over the land. Reading these channels would have you believe that Hamas has destroyed 3,000 Israeli tanks and killed over 20,000 soldiers. Of course this isn‚Äôt talked bout in the media because it‚Äôs ‚Äúcontrolled by the zionists.‚Äù On the one hand Hamas is winning and the other there is a genocide. Are Palestinians destroying Israel in an epic military battle or are they being slaughtered like sheep? According to Palestinian media outlets, the answer is paradoxically both.

Should there be a ceasefire? Well when you‚Äôve been impacted by incessant propaganda, the answer is obviously an emphatic ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Why?¬† because Israel will soon be wiped out and, again, Hamas is winning.¬†

Is there an Israeli/Jewish claim to the land? No, because all Jews they would have you believe come from Poland. Jesus? He was a Palestinian too apparently!¬†

If you read Arab newspapers about Israel‚Äôs attack on Yemen, there is no mention of the fact that Yemen has been lobbing missiles and suicide drones towards Israel for months. You‚Äôd think Israel just attacked Yemen unprompted. This dynamic is why there exists a visceral hatred towards Israel that folks in the West - who don‚Äôt consume Arab sources - simply don‚Äôt understand.

3 months ago I was in a Palestinian Telegram chat with 200,000 subscribers. I suggested maybe Hamas should do a better job of distributing food to civilians. The response en masse was ‚ÄúYOU THINK YOU KNOW BETTER THAN HAMAS?‚Äù After 10 minutes of people berating me for questioning the ‚Äúlions of Hamas‚Äù I was banned. When propaganda is so rooted that differing opinions are triggering, it‚Äôs worrisome.

The contradictions that result from propaganda are endless and at times comical. An Israeli olympian born and raised in Israel whose great grandparents are from Argentina is looked at as an interloper. A Palestinian Olympian born and raised in LA with one Palestinian great-uncle is a native.¬†

The propaganda is unfortunately so effective that it does the Palestinian cause more of a disservice than anything else. The concerted effort to spread misinformation and erase all Jewish ties to the land, coupled with ongoing lies about what‚Äôs happening in the war only serve to radicalize a population to believe that the only path forward is the destruction of Israel as opposed to peaceful coexistence.

Meanwhile, people in Israel have nowhere else to go. Contrary to propaganda spouted by some sources, not all Israeli‚Äôs have dual citizenship. For millions of Israelis, Israel has been their home for generations. And for some, going back 8-10 generations.

1elimt3,Gov Shapiro and The Reality of Antisemitism After 10/7,2024-08-06 14:03:55,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1elimt3/gov_shapiro_and_the_reality_of_antisemitism_after/,"Governor Tim Walz has been chosen for VP Harris' VP. It was between Walz and Gov Josh Shapiro. They were equally good choices as Walz is the best communicator in the Democratic Party and Shapiro the most popular Governor Pennsylvania has had in a long time and they are by far the most key swing state in the election. In the language used leading up to this decision and in its aftermath you wouldn't know that Shapiro is the most effective Governor in the country as citizens and pundits alike have only talked about one thing: his Jewishness.

Now, before I get the comments about how Jewishness and Zionism isn't the same, let's walk through the numbers: 1/3 of Jews are in Israel, leaving 2/3 left globally. If the opinion on Zionism is split down the middle, that still makes a super majority. It would have be 76% of Jews outside Israel are against Zionism in order for Zionism to not represent Jewishness. The reality is that studies have shown over 90% of Jews are Zionists or believe in Israel's existence. Given all this math based in reality, when one signs up for the hatred of Zionists, it's obvious what they're signing up for. 

With that out of the way, we have the real reason Shapiro wasn't chosen. It's all over comments sections, it's all over the news networks prior to the decision in very blatant language. I even see Jewish people accepting that this is simply where we are and they felt it was in their best interest, as Democrats, for Walz to be chosen. If it's not clear, I personally have only voted for Democrats, but this shows wrinkles in what Democratic values are supposed to be. It seems that anti-Israel activists have a achieved one thing and that's keeping a Jewish man out of power and away from helping the country in a way that he's clearly proven to be able to do. 

If you are anti-Israel, why do you ignore that most Jews are Zionist? And why do ignore that the anti-Israel movement has reignited blatant antisemitism? "

I have decided to embark on a Journey to try and see whether Muslim-Jewish coexistence was ever a thing and if so what forms it took. I would like to do that through examining the lives of Jews in the Islamic world from before the Zionist project. Here is my first story:

""Samuel ibn Naghrillah was a Jew of¬†[al-Andalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus)¬†born in¬†[M√©rida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9rida,_Spain)¬†to a wealthy family in 993. He studied Jewish law and became a Talmudic scholar who was fluent in Hebrew, Arabic, Latin, and one of the¬†[Berber languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_languages).[^(\[3\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-MarcusJacob-3)[^(\[6\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-books.google-6)[^(\[7\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-:0-7)

Samuel was the student of Rabbi Chanoch, who was the head of the rabbinical community of the¬†[Caliphate of C√≥rdoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliphate_of_C%C3%B3rdoba); he was only twenty years old when the caliphate fell during the¬†[Fitna of al-Andalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitna_of_al-Andalus), a disastrous civil war. He then moved to¬†[M√°laga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1laga)¬†and became either a spice merchant or grocer. Around 1020, he moved to¬†[Granada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada), where he was hired as the secretary to Abu al- øKasim ibn al- øArif, who was the chief secretary to the king of the¬†[Taifa of Granada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taifa_of_Granada).[^(\[7\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-:0-7)¬†His relations with the Granadan royal court and his eventual promotion to the position of vizier happened coincidentally. 20th-century scholar¬†[Jacob Rader Marcus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Rader_Marcus)¬†gives an interesting account pulled from a 12th-century book¬†[*Sefer ha-Qabbalah*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_ha-Qabbalah). The shop Samuel set up was near the palace of the vizier of Granada, Abu al-Kasim ibn al-Arif.[^(\[3\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-MarcusJacob-3)¬†The vizier met Samuel when his maidservant began to ask Samuel to write letters for her.[^(\[3\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-MarcusJacob-3)¬†Eventually, Samuel was given the job of tax collector, then secretary, and finally assistant¬†[vizier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizier)¬†of state to the Granadan king¬†[Habbus al-Muzaffar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habbus_al-Muzaffar).[^(\[6\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-books.google-6)

When Habbus died in 1038, Samuel ibn Naghrillah made certain that King Habbus‚Äô second son¬†[Badis ibn Habus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badis_ibn_Habus)¬†succeeded him, not his firstborn son Bulukkin.[^(\[5\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-StillmanNorman-5)¬†The reason behind this act was that Badis was more favored by the people, compared to Bulukkin, with the general Jewish population under Samuel ibn Naghrillah supporting Badis.[^(\[8\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-8)¬†In return for his support, Badis made Samuel ibn Naghrillah his vizier and top general.[^(\[5\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-StillmanNorman-5)¬†Some sources say that he held office as a viziership of state for over three decades until his death sometime around or after 1056.

Because Jews were not permitted to hold public office in Islamic nations as an agreement made in the¬†[Pact of Umar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pact_of_Umar), Samuel ibn Naghrillah, a¬†[dhimmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhimmi), should hold such a high public office was rare. This is cited as an example of the¬†[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_of_Jewish_culture_in_Spain)¬†His unique position as the viziership made him the highest-ranking Jewish courtier in all of Spain. Recognizing this, in the year 1027, he took on the title¬†[nagid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagid)¬†""prince"".[^(\[5\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-StillmanNorman-5)¬†That a Jew would command the Muslim army, which he did for 17 years, having them under his authority, was an astonishing feat.[^(\[6\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-books.google-6)

Other leading Jews, including¬†[Joseph ibn Migash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ibn_Migash), in the generation that succeeded Samuel, lent their support to Bulukkin and were forced to flee for their safety.

One story that encapsulates Samuel ibn Naghrillah‚Äôs political prowess takes place soon after the succession of Badis. The faction of¬†[Yaddair ben Hubasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yaddair_ben_Hubasa&action=edit&redlink=1), Habbus' favorite nephew, told Samuel ibn Naghrillah that they wanted to overthrow the new king and wanted his support. Samuel faked support and allowed them to hold a meeting in his house. He told Badis and allowed him to spy on the meeting. Badis wanted to execute the plotters, but Samuel convinced him that it would be politically better not to. In the end, he was even further respected by the king but also in good standing with the rebels.[^(\[7\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-:0-7)

As a Jew, Samuel ha-Nagid actively sought to assert independence from the¬†[geonim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geonim)¬†of the¬†[Talmudic academies in Babylonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmudic_academies_in_Babylonia)¬†by writing independently on¬†[halakha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha)¬†(Jewish law) for the Iberian Jewish community.[^(\[9\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-9)[^(\[6\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-books.google-6)¬†The Nagid became the leader of Spanish Jewry around the late 1020s.[^(\[6\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-books.google-6)¬†He promoted the welfare of the Jewish people through various acts. For example, he promoted Jewish learning by purchasing many copies of the¬†[Talmud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud), the massive compendium of commentaries on the Jewish oral law. He also promoted the study of the Talmud by giving a form of scholarship to those who wanted to study the¬†[Torah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah)¬†for a living.[^(\[3\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-MarcusJacob-3)¬†He died in 1056 of natural causes.[^(\[10\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-10)

It has often been speculated that Samuel was the father or otherwise an ancestor of¬†[Qasmuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasmuna), the only attested medieval female Jewish poet writing in¬†[Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic), but the foundations for these claims are shaky.[^(\[11\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah#cite_note-11)

I thank all those that have replied, I will endeavour to engage in a constructive discussion with all the points raised throughout the next few days.  
"
1elav3h,What would Israel have to do for you to admit that maybe what they're doing is wrong?,2024-08-06 06:41:21,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1elav3h/what_would_israel_have_to_do_for_you_to_admit/,"We can read the same definitions of genocide, ethnic cleansing, indiscriminate targeting, and displacement but can somehow come to two separate conclusions about Israel's actions. 

So, I'm asking:

What would it take for you to believe (or question) that their actions are wrong and/or disproportionate, or that their actions constitute genocide and/or ethnic cleansing? 

Would it take Benajmin Netanyahu literally saying the words, ""I am actively committing a genocide right now,"" or, ""I am intending on ethnically cleansing the Palestinians from Gaza""? 

Or would it take a joint statement by top military officials confirming that they are intending to expulse Palestinians from Gaza or that they are indiscriminately targeting civilians?

Would it take declassified documents?

Would it take the United States' withdrawal of its billions of dollars of aid? Or maybe sanctions imposed on Israel proper (not just the settlements/settlers)? 

Would it take finding out that they keep Palestinians in caves in the Sinai to make silk jackets for them and when they don't make the jackets fast enough, they unleash flying centipedes into the cave? 

Would it take going into Gaza to witness the destruction everyone is talking about for yourself? There's plenty of videos but those don't seem to count.

Would it take evidence of legitimate work camps? Please, do not say I'm equating this conflict to the Holocaust, because that would be a very disingenuous interpretation of my question. I'm using the camps as a reference as to where the line is drawn in terms of what y'all would consider to be blatant genocide/ethnic cleansing/disproportionate violence.

Would it take a nuclear bomb?

What aren't they doing right now that if they did do, you would begin to question their motives? 

Is there anything? 

I'm hoping for honest, genuine answers. Arguing about October 7 or Hamas would not be on topic for my question. I say this because I have tried asking this question elsewhere and I just keep getting redirects. I want actual answers. I want to know where y'all are coming from.

Thank you in advance.


EDIT: I will not be arguing semantics on words, I will not be arguing for or against my opinion, I literally just want my question freaking answered! "
1el5h86,"Palestine is an Arab national project, not a justice omnicause, and there's nothing wrong with that.",2024-08-06 01:41:31,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1el5h86/palestine_is_an_arab_national_project_not_a/,"I'll cut to the chase: the state of Palestine is an Arab nationalist project, just like Israel is a Jewish nationalist project, and there's nothing wrong with either of those.

It's not hard to tell Israel is Jewish. It's in the flag, it's in the anthem, it's in every symbol.

Pretending that Palestine is not an Arab nationalist project is asinine. Here are the opening lines of the State of Palestine's Declaration of Independence.

>Palestine, the land of the three monotheistic faiths, is where the **Palestinian Arab** **people** was born, on which it grew, developed and excelled. Thus the **Palestinian Arab** **people** ensured for itself an everlasting union between itself, its land, and its history.

This is very similar to the Israeli Declaration of Independence:

>The Land of Israel was the birthplace of the **Jewish people**. Here their spiritual, religious and national identity was formed. Here they achieved independence and created a culture of national and universal significance. Here they wrote and gave the Bible to the world.

While acknowledging different faiths, the declaration does not say ""Palestinian people"". They say ""Palestinian Arab"" - an Arabic-speaking ethnic group assimilated by the spread from the Arabian Peninsula of Islam and it's religion and culture.

Palestine establishes itself as part of the Pan-Arab national project, part of the union of all ethnic and Arabic-speaking peoples. I'll let the declaration do the talking:

>**The State of Palestine is an Arab state**, an integral and indivisible part of the **Arab nation**, at one with that nation in heritage and civilization, with it also in its aspiration for liberation, progress, democracy and unity. The State of Palestine affirms its obligation to abide by the **Charter of the League of Arab States**, whereby the coordination of the Arab states with each other shall be strengthened. It calls upon Arab compatriots to consolidate and enhance the emergence in reality of state, to mobilize potential, and to intensify efforts whose goal is to end Israeli occupation.

Palestine is an Arab state. It is by and for the Arab people.

The Pan-Arab movement sees as its people the Tunisians and the Yemenites and the Jordanians and the Algerians, whether with roots in the land of Palestine or not - but not the non-Arabic speaking Jews of Iran and Ukraine and Germany and Turkey.

Meanwhile, to be balanced, the State of Israel sees as its people the Jews of Iran and Ukraine and Germany and  Turkey - but not the Arabic or Circassian-speaking people of the land of Palestine who are not part of the Jewish nation. Many are Israeli citizens, but they are not the people the Israeli Declaration refers to and grants return.

You end up with Palestine that sees Egyptian Arabs that moved to the land 100 years ago as its people, but not Jewish Ukrainians who left Palestine 1000 years ago but have generations of ancestry there. And Israel sees as its people exactly the opposite.

I'm not here to try and make sense of this, but we have to be honest. Palestine deserves to be free of occupation and war and killing. Palestine is an Arab nationalist project, not a social justice omnicause.

**Ask actual Palestinians if they analogize their struggle to the French Revolution, or the conquests of the  Rashidun Caliphate.**

The answer to that is obvious in their songs, their symbols, their speeches, their politics, their declarations - **everything.** The rhetoric is undeniably Islamic and Arab, not libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√©.

Among Hamas and Fatah, you will see weapons and Islamic symbolism, not hammers and sickles, roses, or red stars. The only exception is the PFLP, which in 2006 won 3 seats to Hamas's 74 and Fatah's 45. **Socialist liberation movements do not call themselves the Al-Aqsa Martyr Brigades.**

Palestine deserves to be a free and independent state alongside Israel. It has chosen to be part of the Arab nation as Israel has chosen to be part of the Jewish one. It is not a Western fantasy of omni-liberation. To bring it freedom, we must accept it as what it is."

The claim that 18 out of 24 battalions prior to the Rafah offensive are out of action are not true. Meanwhile, the claim that the 4 remaining Rafah battalions have also been defeated are not true according to a published investigation and report by the Institute of War (ISW) and the Critical Threats Project (CTP).

Here's an infographic and video by CNN which illustrates the extent of damage Hamas' battalions have received after 9 months now.

Jewish pro-Israeli news networks have also reported on this,

[https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ay7h0fa](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ay7h0fa)

[https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-813365](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-813365)

Hamas has 24 battalions divided into 5 divisions.

6 in the Northern Gaza Division (Jabaliya, Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun, Imad Aql, Khalifa, Suhail Ziyadah)

6 in the Gaza City Division (Sabra Tell Al-Hawa, Shujaiya, Shati Refugee Camp, Sheikh Radwan, Darj Al-Tuffah, Zeitoun)

4 in the Central Gaza Division (Deir Balah, Nuseirat, Bureij, Al-Maghazi)

4 in the Khan Yunis Division (Northern Khan Yunis, Western Khan Yunis, Southern Khan Yunis, Qarara)

4 in the Rafah Division (Yabna, Shaboura, Eastern Rafah, Western Rafah)

**Here's a summary of how many Hamas' battalions are still active for those who don't have time to read the report**

1. 8 battalions are still at combat effectiveness i.e. still able to initiate complex military operations between individual units, plan advanced tactics, and still have a degree of cohesion between sub-commanders. CTP and ISW rated units combat effective when they assessed that they were defending ground using sophisticated tactics and more advanced weapon systems.
2. 13 battalions have been degraded, i.e. still able to conduct sporadic, and guerrilla-style attacks but lack the sophistication of the above 8 battalions

A degraded unit has had losses that impede its ability to execute assigned missions, and it only shows some of the characteristics of a combat-effective unit. It may have lost several commanders in a short time period or suffered losses and Israeli military reports could refer to it as ‚Äúdismantled.‚Äù

This does not mean they are put out of action already. On the contrary, they can still play a critical role either as support to the more full-ready battalions or conduct raids and guerilla attacks on isolated IDF units or IDF supply lines.

3) Only 3 battalions are considered as combat ineffective, meaning when it is no longer able to complete its mission. This is frequently represented by no attacks or very few ineffective attacks.

These battalions are what most people refer to mean when they mean ""destroyed"". Either because their entire chain of command has been destroyed or significantly hampered to the point individual units lack higher command. Another point is also that these battalions were some of the first to bear the brunt of IDF offensives and have been on the front lines ever since the start of the war. Most of these are located in the Northern and Gaza City Division where most of Hamas' battalions are located and where some of the most intense fighting has took place.

4) 7 battalions from the second category (degraded) have received reinforcements and have been reconstituted i.e. re-organized at least once in the past 9 months. These mainly include the Northern Gaza and Gaza City battalions.

This means that at some point, these 7 battalions have either regrouped or reformed, either to plan new operations or to replenish supplies and replace fallen, exhausted military personnel with new fresh ones. While they still are considered as ""degraded"", they've received additional support to patch up any holes in their military capability and continue on fighting for longer.

**If we base our assessment on the ability of a Hamas' battalion to continue fighting and initiate complex operations such as ambushes, then 21 out of 24 battalions are still in shape to continue fighting. Considering Hamas has 40,000 active military personnel within the Al-Qassam Brigades military wing, then probably 25,000 to 35,000 military personnel are still alive and are able to fight**

Even if we were to only include the degraded battalions that have been replenished and reconstituted over the last 9 months, then still, 15 out of 24 battalions are still active. A far cry from the claim Hamas has been nearly destroyed. With this criteria, 20,000 Hamas military personnel are still alive and are able to fight.

At worst, if we only include the fully capable combat-ready battalions, we still are left with 8 out of 24 battalions, a 1/3 of Hamas' military personnel is still at full strength and ready to replace degraded and combat ineffective battalions, at least 10,000 - 15,000 which is still a large number of Hamas military personnel still alive and able to rebuild Hamas after the war.

(For those who want details on each battalion and their status, refer to the ISW report)

**Conclusion and TLDR:** Claiming Hamas is ""nearly destroyed"" is not at all true. It is a far cry from the reality on the ground where most of Hamas' battalions are, at least, still operational. Israel's claim of stating 18 out of 24 battalions are out of action is a severe overestimation. According to non-Middle Eastern, Western American sources, 8 battalions are still at full strength, 13 are degraded yet still militarily capable. After 9 months, only 3 have been completely rendered combat ineffective by the IDF so far. That is not a victory if most of your enemy's forces are still alive and combat-capable even after 9 months. (Plus, let's not forget most of the Israeli hostages are still in Gaza)"
1eksu15,"After almost a year of failing to meet its' declared war aims, Israel has lost the war Gaza war",2024-08-05 16:53:40,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eksu15/after_almost_a_year_of_failing_to_meet_its/,"America never lost a single engagement with the Veit Cong. They obviously had more than enough firepower to destroy every single building in North Vietnam... but they still lost that war.

In Afghanistan and in Iraq, the circumstances were similar. America objectively lost both of its conflicts that it started in the early '00 in response to the terror attacks of September 11th despite having overwhelmingly superior military power.

It is said that war is simply politics by alternative means. As such, and as demonstrated by the above examples, superior force by itself cannot guarantee military victory for those who wield it.

In fact, where you have an asymmetry as with the IDF and Hamas, and the superior force declares that it wishes to completely destroy it's opponent, all the smaller force need to do in order to not lose is survive.

Israel's first mistake in this war was the declaration of war aims to  unrealistic and ultimately unrealisable goals for their war. How ever cathatlrtic it may have been to say they would ""destroy Hamas"" after their October 7th pogrom, it was simply never going to happen. 

Leave aside the fact that this is not the first time that Israel has declared its intention to destroy Hamas in its entirety. I'm pretty sure that was also the declared aim of Operation Protective Edge and the very least, if not more of the numerous bouts of ""mowing the lawn"" in the past couple decades.

However much damage Israel thinks it is doing to Hamas, there is no military solution to the problem Israel has with its' erstwhile neighbours. 

The longer this drags out without Hamas being eradicated, the stronger you make them. I still remember when Hamas were no more significant than the PFLP. they were raised up to the prominence of being a governing authority from utter obscurity with much DIRECT help from Netanyahu who wanted to use them as an excuse to avoid peace talks... but those talks are the only sustainable way out of this mess.

Israel cannot kill its way out of this. I would say in fact that destroying Gaza and killing so many civilians there like they have done will actually make Israel even less safe for the future. 

Ask yourselves... how many of the people who took part in last year's October pogrom you think were orphaned or lost someone dear to them to an Israeli bomb, artillery shell or snipers bullet in one of the previous IDF incursions into Gaza? 

Saying ""it's all Hamas' fault that we're killing so many of your people"" might help you to assuage your conscience... but do you realistically think that a 10 year old kid who watches his mother slump down and die after she was targeted by a sniper will really accept that the person who pulled the trigger is not responsible for their loss?

[Also, why are snipers shooting old women](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/22/1221362655/a-gaza-patriarchate-says-israeli-troops-killed-2-women-and-injured-7-others-at-p)? Can't really blame that on collateral damage... can you?"
1ek3yj6,About the ‚Äúfamine‚Äù in Gaza ,2024-08-04 19:43:04,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ek3yj6/about_the_famine_in_gaza/,"So I keep seeing this subject brought up and people keep misusing the term, so I wanted to get this out of the way.

So apparently the FRC have conducted an investigation and here is their outcome:

‚ÄúThe Famine Review Committee (FRC), a body consisting of five prominent scholars of food security and nutrition, on June 8 rejected as not ‚Äúplausible‚Äù the conclusion that northern Gaza has entered a state of famine. The same body concluded in mid-March that ‚Äúfamine is now projected and imminent‚Äù in northern Gaza by the end of May, a finding that spurred the UN, media outlets, and numerous humanitarian organizations to warn that thousands in Gaza would die of hunger if a ceasefire were not reached immediately.
The FRC conducts reviews on behalf of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification(IPC), the premier global famine monitoring initiative structured as a partnership between governments, international organizations, and NGOs. The FRC rejected claims of famine in northern Gaza on the grounds that such assertions ignored or underestimated the value of both commercial sources of food and certain forms of humanitarian aid. The committee concluded that flows of aid and the availability of food increased significantly in March and April and ‚Äúthat nearly 100 percent of daily kilocalorie requirements were available for the estimated population of 300,000 people in April, even using conservative calculations.‚Äù‚Äù

https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/06/17/expert-panel-rejects-claims-of-famine-in-northern-gaza/

As of now, there are reports of 40 verified cases of death from starvation, this can include people with extreme illness that died and malnutrition was a factor, to people who weren‚Äôt able to afford food or people who couldn‚Äôt get out of the house to buy any.

I ran the numbers to check the starvation % against the US,

in the US 21,000 people die of starvation a year thats 21,000/330,000,000 or 0.000063636363636%

Gaza 40/2,000,000 or 0.00002%

So if we are to say Gaza is in a state of famine would the US also be in that category? Or worse?

1ekkaci,The heroic failure of Al-Qassam ,2024-08-05 10:20:50,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ekkaci/the_heroic_failure_of_alqassam/,"Izz ad-Din al-Qassam (1882‚Äì1935) was a prominent Syrian-born Muslim cleric and militant leader who played a significant role in the early 20th century Arab nationalist and anti-colonial movements in the Middle East.

Born in Jableh, a town on the Syrian coast, al-Qassam received a traditional Islamic education, studying in Cairo at the renowned Al-Azhar University, where he was influenced by contemporary Islamic reformist thought. After completing his studies, al-Qassam briefly joined the resistance against Italian colonial rule in Libya before returnin gto Syria and becoming involved in the national struggle against French colonial rule. His activities made him a target for French authorities, forcing him to flee Syria in 1920.

Al-Qassam moved to Haifa, then part of British Mandate Palestine, where he continued his anti-colonial activism. There, he served as an imam and preacher, gaining a reputation for his fiery sermons advocating resistance against British rule and Zionist settlements.

Haifa was a city in transition. On the steep terraces of Mount Carmel, newly constructed villas and apartment buildings housed newly arrived Jewish residents. Meanwhile, in the Muslim quarter and near the docks and railway yards, unpaved roads and simple single-story dwellings provided basic shelter for thousands of poor Palestinian labourers. It was in this area, around the docks and the neighborhood of Wadi Salib, that al-Qassam came to preach at the Istiqlal (Independence) Mosque.

A man focused on practical action rather than theory, al-Qassam excelled in mobilizing the energies of the poorest Palestinians. As a declared opponent of colonialism and Zionism, he found a receptive audience in Haifa and the surrounding northern Palestinian villages, eager to hear his calls for Islamic reform and armed resistance to defend Palestine.

Palestinian leaders were increasingly alarmed by the rapid influx of Jewish immigrants and land settlements and the ensuing violence. By the early to mid-1920s, Jewish immigration had accelerated the displacement of Palestinian peasants. As absentee Arab landowners sold land to Jewish immigrants, impoverished Palestinian villagers were forced into cities like Haifa, swelling the ranks of the urban poor and the audiences for al-Qassam‚Äôs Friday prayers. At the mosque, they listened with rapt attention as he preached his message of Muslim resurgence and identity.

Believing that only Islam could provide a solid framework for Palestinian opposition and direct action, al-Qassam initiated literacy programs for the poor, taught the Quran, held evening classes, and became actively involved in the Muslim Young Men‚Äôs Association (MYMA). He also established agricultural cooperatives for the rural poor. By 1929, he had become the leader of the MYMA, drawing thousands to his mosque sermons. His appointment as a marriage registrar by the Muslim court in Haifa provided him with cover to travel and build relationships with Palestinian leaders in remote villages and hamlets. During village celebrations, al-Qassam would meet with influential figures and discuss his ideas, including the call for jihad against both the British and Zionist settlers. A British police official noted that al-Qassam would gather the more religious villagers and preach the doctrines of Islam, using Quranic passages to inspire religious fervour and, according to British authorities, sanction violence.

Unlike establishment Muslim leaders, al-Qassam lived a lifestyle similar to those he worked with, in contrast to the aloofness of Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the British-appointed Mufti of Jerusalem and leader of the Supreme Muslim Council. While Husseini, from a notable family, maintained a distant status, al-Qassam, though also from a respected clerical family, was known for his plain living and close connection to the people. This approach was later emulated by his spiritual and political successors in Hamas. Al-Qassam firmly believed that foreign occupation and settlement would not deliver rights to the Arabs, a message he spread in his sermons and public speeches, quickly drawing the scrutiny of British authorities and Zionist opponents.

It was perhaps only a logical next step for al-Qassam to begin organising and training small militant groups, emphasizing guerrilla tactics and the importance of jihad in defending Muslim lands.

1ekk5ty,"Why arent you going for a third way?
",2024-08-05 10:12:42,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ekk5ty/why_arent_you_going_for_a_third_way/,"I see a lot of back and forth on this subreddit who is to blame more. But for once I think there is no good answer here. The entire Region has been home to two peoples that were at odds for millenia by now and they are both so deeply rooted in it that there never will be the one true answer on who is right or wrong, because both kind of are.

Why not go for a ""Palestine without Hamas and Israel without Netanyahu"" kind of approach? Israelis would recognise that the settlements in the eastern bank and the treatment of Palestinians in general is ""less than ideal"" while Palestinians recognize that Israel is literally sorrounded by states that want it to be erased and is also attacked on the regular by said states, never beeing able to lower its guard. Either side is in an impossible spot ride now.

So why dont both sides recognize their dilemma and that a lot has been lost by either side and most importantly: That it has to end. Because at this point there is no other way but look forward.

No counting the losses, no comparing the tallies or the pain, as hard as that may be, no contest on who is suffering more or not. Just a way forward for it to finally end.

Palestinians could follow the example of people like Amin Abed, who are bravely resisting the Hamas rule in Gaza and even getting attacked for it and Israelis the example of parties like Meretz, who are working on removing Netanyahu and moving forward with renewing peace talks like the ones in Oslo.

Because as long as Hamas and Likud are in power, I dont see a single solution that is being discussed here daily being implemented. Because neither is intrested in one. You need both gone in order to even start.

  
Edit: Okay this is turning out worse than I had hoped for it to turn out. To make my message even clearer:

Blaming Israel as Palestinian is easy, blaming Palestine as Israeli is easy. But if Palestinians would only concern themselves with the problems of Hamas while Israelis would do their best to remove Beni you would have less problems. And it would be good if you would coordinate said actions together because this way, no one can claim that only their side was doing something, but both sides."
1ekavkt,Rumor of Abu Obeida‚Äôs Death in Gaza,2024-08-05 00:53:11,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ekavkt/rumor_of_abu_obeidas_death_in_gaza/,"I saw mentioned in a couple places recently that one of the targeted strikes in Gaza may have eliminated Abu Obeida, the spokesperson for the Qassam brigades and Hamas‚Äô military wing.  It‚Äôs not anywhere on Hamas affiliated channels that I‚Äôve seen, and recognize that if this were to have happened, it would be a devastating blow to morale across the board for Palestinian fighters and the cause at large.  To me, he seems to have the support of the people even more so than Haniyeh or Sinwar, but that‚Äôs just from what I‚Äôve picked up from Palestinian chats.  Anyone know if he was in fact eliminated? 

I believe he was the guy who got interviewed on VICE News a few years back and part of me hoped he would somehow see reason and guide the Palestinian people away from this violent course of action and survive this war and lead them to a better future, which I realize is probably naive and stupid.  

(Correction: the guy in the interview called himself Abu Khalid. So could be different guy.)

If that pie in the sky dream couldn‚Äôt be realized, I think he is one of the most HVTs in this war because he appears to be like the heart and soul of the resistance and stands at the center of the information warfare front as well as the ‚Äúresistance fighters‚Äù will to continue and should therefore be relentlessly hunted by the IDF in their fight to victory.

After the assassination of Haniyeh in Teheran, which is about the most eloquently devised attack against a Hamas leader and Iran that most of us could have imagined, the targeting of Abu Obeida would be like a one-two punch knockout with Hamas on the ropes.  I don‚Äôt foresee Sinwar getting got from the air, but it would be nice if the loss of so much of what was the core of Hamas, led enough fighters to lose faith in this fight and rebel against Sinwar.  Having someone from Hamas go down in the tunnel where Sinwar is hiding, kill him and bring him up above ground and have the hostages he was using as shields help escort the body and those fighters to an IDF outpost would sure save a lot of lives on both sides.  

Let me know if anyone‚Äôs heard anything and if my read on this individual‚Äôs role (Obeida) and his value to the Palestinian cause is as important as I think it is.  [VICE News Documentary](https://youtu.be/W4gDfSNMRx4?si=rcnbjoK8fJsyl6Rz)"

Now it looks very serious.

Telltale signs are when countries are telling their citizens to leave on the next available flight, when embassies are being closed, as we see for Lebanon, and travel warnings plus flight cancellations for Israel and Iran.

Another telltale sign is quiet: when Hezbollah and Iran have stopped talking and boasting.

When Israel has basically made it clear  that the negotiations with Hamas are over and that there's something long haul coming.

When Israeli home defense has come out with plans for days of power cuts, internet outages and evacuations to the South.

>*In the event of war with Hezbollah, the document envisages a potential three-day power outage in some cities; breakdowns in water supply that could last days; a disconnection of landlines for up to eight hours and cellphone communications for up to 24 hours; and brief local disruptions to radio and internet.*

>*Some 40% of the nation‚Äôs workforce may be unable to work for the duration of the conflict, and service providers from outside affected areas may become unavailable throughout, according to the document.*

>*At the same time, ‚Äúthe reality for the other side will be far worse, to put it mildly,‚Äù one security official told The Times of Israel.*

I am sure there are some of you in Israel who were there in 2006. Curious what your thoughts are now.

Then there's several Israeli divisions on the Lebanese border fully prepared. the return of the US fleet to the region ready to react.... Iran making it more or less clear it will react directly and not just through its proxies.

Hezbollah being a potent force in 2006, but technology having moved on considerably since then... as well as decades of stockpiling.

What are we looking at now? Is it overblown or is this a very dangerous moment coming up?

And when?"
1ejz7v8,I consider myself 'neutral' and I have many questions.,2024-08-04 16:25:35,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ejz7v8/i_consider_myself_neutral_and_i_have_many/,"I consider myself neutral and I have many questions.

For context, I am Muslim, Franco-Algerian, my maternal grandmother was Jewish but converted to Islam after marrying my grandfather (I have no news from the Jewish side of my family), I have several Jewish friends but none live in Israel. I support a two-state solution, am anti-Hamas (but I understand why some might support Hamas under certain conditions), and am anti-Netanyahu's government (but I understand why some might support it under certain conditions). I don't expect to make friends here; I just want to understand.

1. Why are Palestinians so attached to their land? I understand from a Jewish perspective that this attachment is due to religion, but nothing in Islam suggests such an attachment to this land, if I'm not mistaken (except for Jerusalem). There have been millions of population migrations even in recent history; during the Great Nakba, millions of Pakistanis and Indians were displaced simultaneously, and lands changed hands (e.g., Alsace in France). Why are they unable to accept a change of land as everyone else has throughout history?
2. Why do pro-Palestinian supporters not take into account the injustices suffered by Israelis? (Notably, the lack of access to the Western Wall until 1967; being religious, this is a central point for me.)
3. I know I may be idealistic, but why isn't there a clear delineation of borders, with monitored walls 24/7, and perhaps a tunnel or highway connecting Gaza to the West Bank? And with Jerusalem under the control of a special government (the UN? A state like Vatican City?) that would make it an exclusively religious city?
4. I understand the pro-Gaza demonstrations, but what do pro-Palestinian supporters expect by chanting ""From the River to the Sea""? Don‚Äôt they realize that Israel has been there for over 70 years? That many of its inhabitants speak only Hebrew? That they might not be able to live elsewhere?
5. Why are there so many illegal settlements in the West Bank? Israel doesn‚Äôt seem to be a megalopolis full of skyscrapers; why don‚Äôt people establish their villages/towns/settlements within Israeli territories instead of provoking global dislike by not respecting international rules? This undermines any peace process.
6. Why is there so much paranoia? Pro-Palestinian supporters seem to think that Jews control the world and that one cannot speak without endangering their career. Pro-Israeli supporters seem to think that the whole world is antisemitic. I know antisemitism exists and that many Jews are powerful (good for them; why do pro-Palestinians envy this when Jews have worked hard for it?), but the proportions seem completely exaggerated.
7. Why are so many people interested in this war? I understand the 'Israel is a democracy so it‚Äôs shocking' aspect, but it feels like it's all anyone talks about, whether on the left or the right. Why are there so many pro-Palestinian supporters but not as many pro-Uighur or pro-Syrian civilians? How can organizations like AIPAC exist? Why are members of certain right-wing Western governments so pro-Israeli (e.g., the USA, France, Argentina, and the Netherlands)? Don‚Äôt they think about Palestinian civilian victims throughout history?
8. For Israelis, how do you see the future? Specifically regarding Gaza? Should Gaza be bombarded indefinitely as is currently done? Invade the area? Send all the inhabitants to another country? How do you respond to criticisms regarding the inequalities in access to resources and services between Israeli citizens and Palestinians living under occupation?
9. For pro-Palestinians, why do you continue to support Hamas? I‚Äôm not talking about those who have no choice but to support them, but about certain politicians or pro-Palestinian supporters who are comfortably situated outside Palestine/Israel. Don‚Äôt you see that these are just people who do not want peace?
10. On both sides, how can you justify the killing of civilians? The events of October 7th? The bombings that cause thousands of civilian deaths?
11. Why do Israelis seem to specifically target civilians and journalists? I am aware that we live in an era where everyone has a phone with 4G capable of documenting everything that happens, but the number of journalists and civilians killed seems incredibly high. Furthermore, why do Israeli soldiers seem to behave so poorly? I have seen several videos of them seemingly taking pleasure in bombing houses, stealing belongings, etc. I had never seen this before‚Äîcould there be a particular reason for it? Are they raised with a particular animosity towards Palestinians?

I have many more specific questions, but these are the main ones that come to mind. Please don‚Äôt feel obliged to answer everything; these are just questions that seem 'simple' from my 'neutral' point of view. I will delete this if I see that people are unable to agree.

EDIT : When I mention supporting Hamas or Netanyahu's government, I‚Äôm referring to the perspective of someone from Gaza who has lived under oppression for a lifetime or from a nationalist Israeli perspective."
1ejye83,"Muslim men, sexual frustration & violence",2024-08-04 15:50:52,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ejye83/muslim_men_sexual_frustration_violence/,"I want to bring up this subject because it is not often discussed. I want to shed some light on the sociocultural and religious dynamics that contribute to this issue.

As we all know Islam encourages procreation, ideally with multiple women, emphasizing the importance of family and children in spreading and sustaining the faith. Many Muslims believe that raising children within the faith is a fundamental duty.

This imperative exists alongside strict monogamy laws and stringent sexual ethics, creating a paradox that can lead to sexual frustration and confusion among Muslim men.

Because islamic teachings promote modesty, chastity, and self-control. Premarital and extramarital sex are prohibited, and even interactions between unmarried men and women are often heavily regulated. The emphasis on these values can often result in an intense internal conflict for men who struggle to reconcile their natural sexual desires with religious expectations.

My personal experience with this, while volunteering for an immigration NGO in Europe, is that the muslim men were notably fixated on Western women. Not only did they frequently stare at blonde women, but it is also quite common for asylum seekers here to carry condoms with them, for example.

This brings me to another point: The assault by Gazans on Israel. For a population ostensibly engaged in a struggle against oppression and the seizure of their land, their choice of target was notably striking: (objectively speaking) Attractive and young women participating in a music festival. The act of mass rape appears to be incongruous with the principles of political protest against colonization.

What are your thoughts on this?"
1ejxa1s,How do you deal with being in the middle of people disagreeing on the conflict?,2024-08-04 15:02:12,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ejxa1s/how_do_you_deal_with_being_in_the_middle_of/,"I‚Äôm here for opinions on dealing with people you love clashing with each other for ¬´¬†their core beliefs¬†¬ª. I‚Äôm not Jewish or Israeli, not Palestinian - no direct links to the conflict. 

My childhood best friends has tights to Judaism because her grandfather rejected his jewish origins after his mother got deported during WW2, and she (my friend) has been trying to explore and reestablish this connection with being Jewish for her and her family. She‚Äôs been to Israel a couple of times, to ¬´¬†reconnect¬†¬ª but has never lived there. She is European but reads/practices some traditions, here and there. She feels very deeply about Judaism, antisemitism (rightly so) and the importance of recognizing the Jewish suffering, which has led to put an emphasis on suffering and death on the Israeli side of the conflict more than on the Palestinian side.

My partner has no link to the conflict, however, he was brought up in a very activist household, traveling a lot to Middle Eastern countries for research about arabic art & culture. Generally, he feels very passionately about the Palestinian cause, and is positioned against the Zionist project of the Jewish people self determination on the land of Palestine as well as the current and past actions of the government regarding the mass killing of Palestinians. He is very wellread and informed about this topic, and it has not started with 7th/10 attacks. Before anyone says it, I genuinely do not believe him to be antisemitic. He focuses on addressing the government actions and military oppression of Gaza and Rafah, and his focus is largely on decolonial policies, and international law.
After the 7th of October, my friend replied quite strongly to my partner‚Äôs stories that were providing an account of the times the Israel gov had killed and attacked Palestinians in the past, in an attempt to counter the argument that the conflict and war started with Hamas‚Äô attacks of the 10/07. I can understand why a reasoned account of this may be distressing for someone experiencing emotional distress.

Ever since, they have barely spoken. No insults, no violence, but just weird vibes. I‚Äôm sure you get the picture.

I personally stand against systemic oppression of a country largely supported by powerful countries against a people under siege, AND I can simultaneously understand the generational trauma of Jewishness and the emotional dilemmas coming with it. 
And I also understand that deep down, it comes to their core values and what they hold dear to their heart and what they think is true, and as friend/partner I can‚Äôt bring myself to force them to ‚Äúovercome‚Äù this so social situations are more pleasant. My connection to them individually is not affected by the positioning because I understand where they each come from, as someone who has the chance of not being directly implicated in the conflict.

How have you death with that?"
1ejwshj,Why is everyone hating on israel,2024-08-04 14:40:22,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ejwshj/why_is_everyone_hating_on_israel/,"I find it difficult to understand why there is so much animosity toward Israel when colonization has been a part of global history for centuries. The entire world has been colonized by various empires and nations throughout time.

For instance, the colonization of North and South America led to the displacement and decimation of indigenous populations. The British Empire's expansion across the globe resulted in the subjugation of Africans and the exploitation of native Australians. The conquests of Genghis Khan brought massive death and destruction across Asia. The Ottoman Empire, which ruled large parts of Southeast Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa for centuries, was often harsh in its governance, imposing heavy taxes and restrictions on its diverse subjects. These examples are just a few among many others.

Given this context, I struggle to understand why Israel is often singled out as being particularly villainous. There are regimes today, like North Korea, that are notorious for their oppressive practices, and some Middle Eastern countries have significant human rights issues.

Israel, like any nation, has a right to exist and defend itself. The modern state of Israel was established in 1948, following a UN resolution and the aftermath of World War II. It has faced numerous conflicts and wars since its founding, often surrounded by hostile neighbors. Despite these challenges, Israel has become a vibrant democracy and a hub of innovation and culture.

While criticisms can be made about specific policies or actions, the level of hatred directed at Israel seems disproportionate. Is this criticism because it is a Jewish state? It seems inconsistent, considering the scale and impact of historical and contemporary actions by other nations and empires. Israel's existence and its people's right to self-determination should be respected, just as with any other nation."
1ejvs36,Israel has hit two schools and yesterday a school and before that another school,2024-08-04 13:53:02,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ejvs36/israel_has_hit_two_schools_and_yesterday_a_school/,"This is what happens when you have a green light to do as you wish and when you know there are no repercussions.

These sort of actions are possible when you have a crowd using a blanket cover for their own wrong doings. Things like oh there was a Hamas unit or Hamas operation in there or antisemitism. 

The total disregard for civilians is very evident. 

This is to top off the many recent events like also murdering and assassinating journalists just like how they murdered two journalists on their job.

It is evident that going unpunished like this would only make Israel the new Saddam in the region unless they are properly sanctioned and boycotted.

Since the government and people in authority there bask in any wiggle room out of the crimes like using silly excuses or putting enormous resources into either silencing the truth or propaganda or any other way to change the media narrative.

Now how can Israel‚Äôs regime talk about their own civilians being bombed or targeted when they have been doing that for every day since October? 

This is the school bully whose father is the principal and uncle is the school owner. No limit and no rules. If anyone dares to respond to that bullying they face all sorts of issues. 

There is no equality or equity and hypocrisy prevails.

The person claimed ""they removed it afterwards"", unsure if they were talking about the first or second point.

I'm always very skeptical of accusations of atrocities from the IDF because I heard journalists within Gaza can't publish stuff Hamas doesn't like + I don't trust Al Jazeera because it's owned by Qatar which funds Hamas (is this accurate to say?).

1ejf4ar,"A working definition of whataboutism, and how it applies to the conflict.",2024-08-03 21:58:59,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ejf4ar/a_working_definition_of_whataboutism_and_how_it/,"Two kids are trick-or-treating and they come across a bowl of candy with a sign that says ""take one"". The first kid sheepishly takes three, and the second kid takes the bowl and dumps it into his bag. The first kid says ""How could you do that?"", and the second kid replies, ""I just did the same thing you did.""

The second child is taking advantage of the fact that the first child is not morally pure to avoid being held accountable for a much more heinous act, as the first child can't contiue their criticism without taking responsibility for their own misdeeds, which harms them. 

This example of whataboutism is illustrative, but incomplete. It's not required that the first child do something immoral, just something which is inconvenient to defend. What *is* required is that the second party be acting qualitatively worse than the first. If both kids had taken three pieces of candy, the second kid would have been well within his rights to point out that they behaved the same. 

States in particular must engage in some seemingly indefensible behavior if they are to survive. Abstractly, we might say that this is because there is no government at this level to exert the necessary force to resolve prisoners dilemmas. There *fundamentally* can be no ""moral purity"", it is too maladaptive. So if we are going to make moral judgments about states, we *must* accept some grey. 

Whataboutism is so effective in the arena of International law that it is, at this point, a doctrine of international diplomatic policy. Most people's moral compass is calibrated to existing under the protection of *civil* law. Prisoner's dilemmas are rare, because people who hurt you are punished for doing so, and it is therefore not in their interest.

For example, say you live in America, and your neighbor is stockpiling weapons next door. It's an overreaction to blow up his house in self defense. The reason for this is because if he uses those weapons to murder your family, the government will make sure that it wasn't worth it for him to do that. So he has nothing to gain by posing a threat to you. 

On the other hand, if a neighboring state with more military power is massing troops on the border of your country, it is not an overreaction to strike first. No one will come around after they wipe you out and make sure they get their comeuppance, you've got to take every advantage you can get. 

This dynamic has changed a bit in recent decades, which further complicates this discussion, and the reason that we are even involved in these discussions about ""who is committing war crimes"" and so forth is because we have invented a small amount of interstate law, but it does not function the same was as civil law. International law is not static, and essentially supposes a hierarchy of state rights. The enforcement mechanisms are not strong, and the basic goals of international law are not the preservation of the rights of states, but the prevention of world war. 

People have a hard time reasoning about international law, because it does not match their intuition of civil law, and so it becomes a natural arena for whataboutism. 

The rule against Genocide is a proportionality rule. This means that there are no examples of genocide in war that would not be war crimes without the rule against genocide, every genocide is also disproportionate, because you are killing civilians without fulfilling a military objective. The rule against genocide seeks to fill the role that marking a particular crime a ""hate crime"" plays in civil law. If you have *targeted* a civilian population that shares some protected property, then your war crime gets upgraded to genocide. 

(It is, frankly, a stupid rule. I say this as a ""holocaust-aware"" Jew. The only way that an attack on civilians would not be a genocide is if your reason for attacking those civilians is not protected. For a simple example of why this is stupid, the Khmer Rouge killed every Cambodian who wore glasses on the premise that smart people wore glasses, and for some reason Pol Pot wanted to kill smart people. By the wording of the rule against genocide, this was not a genocide because it did not have the specific intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a *national, ethnic, racial, or religious group*. This is obviously stupid, as the Cambodian genocide is one of the clearest examples of something that we might want to consider a genocide.)

The point of calling Israel's campaign in Gaza a genocide, is to deflect from the fact that the massacre on October 7th very clearly meets all of the criteria for genocide. Attacking a festival during a religious holiday made sure that the targets were Jews, and furthermore, civilians. 

In fact, the entire Islamic campaign against Israel, starting in ~1920 with Hajj Amin, has been to cleanse Palestine of its regions where Jews form a majority. This fact is occasionally disputed, but far more often, The fact is *countered* with the claim that actually the Jews are committing genocide in Palestine.

In order to make this claim, one must stretch the definition of genocide to encompass activities which are *clearly not as bad as killing hundreds of thousands of civilians just to have them dead*. Then, once your definition of genocide is broad enough to encompass the two actions, you can assert that there's no distinction between your motives and theirs, despite being obviously distinct. 

Some other examples of whataboutism in this conflict:

Theocracy:

I think this more or less speaks for itself. I'm not even really of the opinion that you can stretch the definition of ""theocracy"" enough to encompass both Israel and Iran, but in doing so, it is clear that you have spanned more than an order of magnitude of religious freedom and control. Nevertheless, accusations that Israel is a theocracy are abundant. Why? Because it takes ammunition from the anti-Islamists. ""If you oppose theocracy, then you can't do any better with a Jewish state than you can with islamic one.""

Journalistic freedom:

As you probably know, Israel has banned Al Jazeera from operating in Israel. You will hear no end of this fact if you mention that Journalism in Gaza fundamentally cannot be trusted. There is plenty of journalism that is critical of the war in Israel. Photographers in Gaza are required to turn off their cameras when wounded combatants are brought to the hopsital. Al Jazeera, on the other hand, is funded by the Qatari royal family, and has very obvious ties to Hamas and, more broadly, the entire Islamic campaign against Israel. Furthermore, they had an office in Israel until *May* of this year. 

These are *not* comparable policies.


This list goes on, but it's better if you fill it in for yourself. 

I would like to conclude by pointing out that whataboutism itself has become a target for whataboutism. In fact, I expect the main dissenting comment on this post to be something along the lines of ""What about the whataboutism that Israel engages in?"". I just ask that when you consider that response, you ask yourself, has this definition of whataboutism been stretched to include Israel's behavior? Is Israel's engagement in whataboutism an order of magnitude less severe than the whataboutism engaged in the examples I have given here?"
1ej1jho,Could Jews and Palestinians have coexisted,2024-08-03 11:53:17,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ej1jho/could_jews_and_palestinians_have_coexisted/,"Let's put aside what eventually went down with displacements and conflict over ownership.

Jews have attempted to migrate to this region for a while, with the 5 'Aliyahs'. The first major one was in 1882-1903 where about 30,000 Jews migrated to Palestine (before Zionism was established). By 1939 over 400,000 Jews migrated there, and about 80,000 more before Israel was established in 1948.

The resistance to this came from the 1st Aliyah, in form of protests, violence and general tension. So it was never a comfortable process, even before there was any goals to create the state of Israel. The local population has always hated the idea of Jews coming in and setting up shop there, despite their contributions to agriculture, education, medicine and overall industry. 

What I don't understand is, why couldn't the locals accept these primarily persecuted refugees into their wider culture? Overall, only about 500,000 Jews moved there, 1/20th of current population that the region is supporting today. And they genuinely suffered a catastrophic genocide in Europe. By comparison, over 7,000,000 Arab Muslims have migrated to Europe in the same timeframe, and have been welcomed with open arms.

Both groups essentially believe in the same God, share similar cultural origins (Muhammad the prophet was highly influenced by Jewish tribes in the Medina), and Jews arguably have a slightly stronger cultural tie to that specific region, due to all the holy sites relevant to them. Overall, the whole area is a dot on the wider Middle Eastern map, yet there wasn't any room available for both? I don't really understand that."
1eixn52,Community feedback/metapost for August 2024,2024-08-03 07:42:05,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eixn52/community_feedbackmetapost_for_august_2024/,"# Recent Policy Changes

Last week we [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1edhma0/changes_to_moderation_3q24/) that we would be making changes to our moderation policy which includes a more light-handed approach to moderation (in light of a significant reduction of activity since October 7th which has made it easier for us to stay on top of reports and user violations) as well as various transparency related changes which will help users better understand when a specific content has been actioned, what it was actioned for, and what action was taken.

Alongside these changes we have created a new [Wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/wiki/mods_index/moderation_policy/) which explains our moderation policy in detail and answers frequently asked questions that we receive in terms of moderation and outlines how to appeal warnings or bans in the event a user feels as though they have been wrongly actioned.

A number of the changes outlined in the metapost have already started being implemented to some degree while the details of others such as the promotion of senior mods to overseers and the option of amnesty for some permanently banned users are still being ironed out.

# Common Misconceptions About Moderation

As great as the creation of the recent FAQ is, I would like to further expand on the topic of how moderation works behind the scenes as well as address claims of bias resulting from users either not understanding our current workflow or only noticing some of the actions that we take while not noticing others.

**Content Volume:**

In order to better understand our current workflow we need to talk about sub activity. In the past 30 days, users have submitted 707 posts and 61,823 comments. If we zoom out to the past 12 months those numbers grow to a staggering 24.3k and 2.9 million respectively.

**Detection of Violations**

Due to the volume of content posted on the sub it is impossible for us to manually review each and every comment to see if it violates our rules which (more often than not) results in users who are in violation not being actioned.

As mods there are three main ways in which we detect violations:

* **Regular participation in the subreddit:** While some users may prefer that moderators act exclusively as third party observers, many of us have personal or academic interest in the conflict and believe that this is one of the best subs for discussion the conflict on Reddit. As such, you will occasionally find us participating as regular users in addition to our regular moderation duties. If we notice content that violates the rules as we participate we will either action it immediately or report it ourselves so we can action it later.
* **Modmail and Metaposts:** While this is the least efficient way to bring rule breaking content to our attention, occasionally users will send us links to specific content either in metaposts or modmail that they want to be actioned. Oftentimes this will be content that no one ever reported and that we never saw causing users to think that we have deliberately ignored it causing them to send it to us directly.
* **User Reports: T**he vast majority of rule violations that we encounter are sent to us by users via the report button which is ultimately the best way to bring such content to our attention. This content gets added to the mod queue which is then manually reviewed by our team.

**Reports and Removals**

In the past 12 months we have received 2.6k reports on posts (10.6% of all posts) and 34.8k reports on comments (1.2% of all comments). As the volume between posts and comments is vastly different as is our enforcement of them I'll address each separately.

Posts:

The moderation of posts is largely carried out by the automod which automatically removes content that does not meet our quality standards such as link posts or posts which do not meet our character threshold. Along with manual removals, this represent 58.8% of all post submissions on the subreddit. The remaining 10k posts either do not violate the rules or the OP receives a warning rather than their post being removed.

As there is generally a manageable volume of posts we are able to manually read all of them and take action when necessary.

Comments:

Comments on the other hand are a completely different beast as their moderation is not so easily automated. While the automod can detect violations to some degree and add them to the mod queue on its own, this occasionally results in false positives which can fill up the queue making it more difficult to handle actionable content. For now we have decided to disable the module that automates reports and rely on user reports instead until such time as we can further improve the detection system.

In addition to the difficulty of automating reports, 98.8% of comments are not reported to us by users despite many of them being rule violations.

**Report Bias**

While some users make a genuine effort to report all rule breaking content in order to improve the quality of the sub, more often than not they will only report content they disagree with while turning a blind eye to content they support even if it violates the rules. If the community is made up of more users from one ideological camp it ultimately results in more reports against users from the smaller faction. On our sub that translates to pro-Palestinian users being reported more often than pro-Israel users.

While there is an argument to be made that pro-Palestinian users may violate the rules more often than pro-Israel users (despite there being no data to make any concrete determination one way or the other) it should not distract from the issues that arise as a result of report bias.

There are a number of ways to tackle the issue of report bias which I will outline below:

1. Users should report all violations that they see even if they agree with the user violating the rules or the violation itself. This will result in a much cleaner subreddit which in turn will provide for a better experience for everyone.
2. Pro-Palestinian users should report violations more often in order to make up for the discrepancy between reports against pro-Palestinian content and pro-Israel content on the sub which will result in more balanced actioning of content between each group.
3. While this is the least preferred option (as user reports are more accurate than using an automated detection system), we could turn the automod report module on again which will catch reports from both sides that users have not reported to us themselves.

Hopefully by raising awareness of the problem as well as offering potential solutions to it we can start seeing positive changes without the mod team being required to automate the report process.

**The Mod Queue**

when users report posts and comments they get added to something called the mod queue. This is a page where moderators can see a list of potential violations as well as why they were reported. While every mod has their own workflow for dealing with reports, I will show you how I personally handle moderation of the sub so that you can get a better idea of what happens behind the scenes.

While there is a newer version of the mod queue I use old Reddit since it gives me the ability to use various browser extensions such as Toolbox which makes moderation more efficient.

[Old Reddit Mod Queue](https://preview.redd.it/0an09vsa9egd1.png?width=1529&format=png&auto=webp&s=902ab0c6ed4c5d5af3985e4fb8fe5f8283c881fb)

The first thing I do is find a post or comment that breaks the rules. For this demonstration we will use the following comment which was a Rule 1 violation as an example. Telling someone they have hate in their heart, calling them anti-Semitic, an ignorant piece of shit, etc makes this a pretty clear cut case.

https://preview.redd.it/11j6r10s9egd1.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8b13ca15a770766213a73a09e3b7e745fa937f8

Next I click the context button to see if there were any additional violations in the comment chain. This is important because users will often only report one violation and not others which results in allegations of bias especially in cases where there is a flame war between users. If we ban one user and not another people automatically assume we are ignoring the violation on purpose without considering the possibility that it was never reported to us and we didn't see it.

It should be mentioned that we aren't always able to review the context of literally every violation especially when there is a backlog in the queue so it is still important for users to report all violations and not only the ones from users they disagree with.

In this example there were no additional violations in the immediate comment chain so we can continue with enforcement.

I start by clicking the username of the offending user to see if they have any previous violations. In this case they do not meaning they will be given a warning.

This creates a mod note which makes it easier for us to track their previous violations and lets us know how to action them in the future if they continue to violate the rules.

Next I click the reply button and select our custom warning template for Rule 1 violations.

I then quote the offending text, fill in the action taken section, and post the warning.

https://preview.redd.it/kk4zej0jhegd1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=6388e62c58797cae113f9fc57378a7e8e334f425

After that I click the approve and ignore reports buttons to remove it from the queue.

When we return to new Reddit this is the result as seen by users:

# Wrapping Things Up

Hopefully this metapost gives everyone additional insight as to how we operate as moderators and encourages the increased use of the report button. As much as we may wish to be, we are not omnipresent and are not able to catch every single violation on the sub without significant user assistance.

Two things before signing off:

* Let us know in the replies what you think about the recent changes on the sub, if you noticed them, and most importantly if you feel as though they had a positive effect.
* If you have more questions about moderation workflows or anything related to the subject please feel free to ask. While I tried to be as thorough as I could I know I've missed some important points which I can address in the comments or in future metaposts.

As usual, if you have something you wish the mod team and the community to be on the lookout for, or if you want to point out a specific case where you think you've been mismoderated, this is where you can speak your mind without violating the rules. If you have questions or comments about our moderation policy, suggestions to improve the sub, or just talk about the community in general you can post that here as well.

Please remember to keep feedback civil and constructive, only rule 7 is being waived, moderation in general is not."
1eiuycv,The Palestinian cause is all about Islam. Why is this not obvious to people?,2024-08-03 04:52:54,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eiuycv/the_palestinian_cause_is_all_about_islam_why_is/,"From a young age, since first learning about Islam and first learning about the Israel-Palestine conflict, one fact has always been painfully obvious to me: **This conflict is driven entirely by Islam.** I didn‚Äôt want to believe it. I dug into this confict eager to find evidence that this wasn‚Äôt the case. But the more I learned and the deeper I dug, the more evidence mounted for me that the problem is Islam, and the less I could deny it. Why is this not obvious to more people? I feel like the only sane person in a world gone crazy sometimes, because it‚Äôs painfully obvious to me. All the logic adds up, and leads inevitably to this conclusion.

[Islam has a long and storied tradition of territoriality.](https://quran.com/2/191?translations=31,101,22,85,21,84,17,95) It‚Äôs as much a political system and a military campaign as it is a spirituality. If not moreso. The world is divided into the World of Submission (good), and the World of War (bad). And once a piece of land and its inhabitants come under Islamic rule, it is to remain an inalienable part of the *Dar al-IslƒÅm*, and its local inhabitants part of the *Ummah* (Muslim community), forever. If a non-Muslim polity threatens to take control of one sliver of land that has ever come under Muslim rule, it behooves the entire *Ummah* to do whatever it takes to repel this threat and reassert Muslim rule there. Because such a threat is inherently a threat to, and calls into question, Islam‚Äôs very truth and legitimacy. It raises the possibility that Allah and/or His Prophet lied. Or, much less unsettlingly (and therefore more commonly), it raises the possibility that Allah is not yet pleased enough with His followers to make good on His promises to them for this world. Therefore, logically, they have to live more observantly and fight the infidels harder, before that can happen. Allah is a god with much *ghayrah* ‚Äî protective jealousy ‚Äî after all. He may be ‚Äúmost merciful‚Äù, but in the Qur‚Äôan and AhƒÅdƒ´th, Allah responds with understandable rage at people‚Äôs devotion to, and distraction by, anything but praising and serving Him.

The Palestinian struggle works against the Palestinian people‚Äôs own best interests, on every level *except* a wished-for spiritual one. By all rational worldly measures, their cause ‚Äî and their relentless belligerence in service of it ‚Äî constitutes prideful ‚Äúcutting off one‚Äôs nose to spite one‚Äôs face‚Äù. Only sincere religious belief is capable of turning a population into such a staunch united front against their own best [worldly] interests. Again, why do so few people see this? It‚Äôs not complicated.

The fact is, I think a lot of non-Muslims are a lot like I used to be: **they *don‚Äôt want to believe* that this conflict is all about Islam**. Why? Because they couldn‚Äôt take the logical ramifications of this, namely that the *Dar al-IslƒÅm* will never give them a moment‚Äôs peace, until Islam either ceases to exist or conquers the entire world. And with a firm grip on a significant chunk of humanity and a vital resource that all of humanity still depends on (petroleum), this is not a threat that can easily be ignored or contained. And that‚Äôs scary. Like, *existentially* scary. As scary as Israel‚Äôs thriving existence is to Islam‚Äôs honor and glory, in land that used to be part of Islam‚Äôs heartland. It‚Äôs much more comforting to believe that this conflict is merely about land or human rights. Because those kinds of problems are amply precedented and much easier to solve.

And the Muslim Brotherhood, for their part, are happy to feed into much of the West‚Äôs *need to believe* that this conflict isn‚Äôt about Islamism. That‚Äôs the only way they could garner non-Muslim support for the cause, after all. This was the game plan of their [1993 meeting in Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:%22The_1993_Philadelphia_Meeting%22_searchable.pdf), after all. That‚Äôs Philadelphia, *USA*, by the way, as opposed to the old name for Amman, Jordan. In other words, right under the West‚Äôs noses. Utterly shameful that this meeting and its aims and recommendations ‚Äî all in English from start to finish ‚Äî aren‚Äôt more widely known in the West. After getting away with this, *why wouldn‚Äôt* Palestinians (and their supporters in the Muslim Arab world) think we Westerners are a bunch of gullible fools?!"

> ""He said, 'It is a free place‚Äîspeak about whatever you want.' So first one lawyer stood up, then another, and another, and they each spoke about their clients,"" Shehadah recalled. ""There was no reaction from the judge, no court reporter taking anything down. We were just little children he wanted to please by letting us speak to our heart's content. I was sitting in front of the wolfish-looking man, who had placed his box of papers under his chair. One of the Israeli lawyers really thought he had a good case. He argued that his client was being arrested because he had refused to become a collaborator. At that point, the wolfish man got up, walked over, and said something to the military prosecutor. I immediately realized that this man was from the Shin Bet [the Israeli security services responsible for gathering the evidence against suspected Palestinian activists]. So we all spoke to our heart's content, and then the judge asked us to please leave the room. After a while, we were called back. All the prisoners were there. The judge said that there was no point in dealing with each case separately, so he ordered the fifteen prisoners to stand and then pronounced, 'I confirm the administrative detention order for all of you.'"" In every case in which the Israeli army accuses a Palestinian of security offenses, the clients were not allowed to see the evidence against them because it was gathered covertly‚Äîthrough informers and wiretaps‚Äîby the Shin Bet, and divulging any of it to the accused or his lawyer might expose the secret means by which it was gathered; at least that was what the Shin Bet argued. This made mounting a defense rather difficult‚Äîif not absurd‚Äîand made a mockery of the principle of due process.
""I was sad and insulted,"" Shehadah told me after the incident. ""I walked out with tears in my eyes. My clients had to cheer me up. They said, 'Don't worry, six months in prison isn't that long. It will be over soon.' I just walked out thinking, What am I doing here?""Deep down, Raja Shehadah knew what he was doing there, and it had little to do with justice or with him. The Shin Bet and the military courts became the tools through which the Israeli public took out its rage against the Palestinians for all the rocks they threw, all the bombs they left under bus seats, all the terrorist attacks they mounted against Israeli targets abroad.


Page 360
> Most of the Palestinians convicted by the shin bet were guilty of planing or carrying out violent acts against Israeli civilians, even if the evidence against them was incomplete, inadmissible, or obtained through intimidation. Moreover, the mere fact that Israel maintained a legal code and system of courts in dealing with the West Bank and Gaza Strip created a restraining legal culture that had a certain effect on the Israeli military authorities. But the longer the occupation went on, the less restraint the legal system seemed to exercise. Frankly, I never found the Israeli legal abuses to be particularly surprising. The Israelis were fighting a war with another community living right next door‚Äîa community that itself was not playing by any rules. It was the Israelis‚Äô pretense I found tiresome‚Äîthe self-delusions that somehow they were always behaving in legal and morally upright ways, while their enemies, the Palestinians, were simply vile terrorists beyond the pale of civilization. The truth was, each side understood that they were in a war for communal survival. One side had knives and pistols, the other had secret agents and courts. While each constantly cried out to the world how evil the other was, when they looked one another in the eye‚Äîwhether in the interrogator‚Äôs room or before thrusting a knife in a back alley‚Äîthey said something different: I will do whatever I have to to survive. Have no doubt about it.


If anyone has any sources about this that would be great. I‚Äôd also love to hear of any recent reforms made to this current system for Palestinians."
1eijk9k,"Open letter signed by 45 American health workers: ""Children shot in the head daily""",2024-08-02 19:56:26,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eijk9k/open_letter_signed_by_45_american_health_workers/,"Letter - www.tinyurl.com/gazadoctorsletter July 25th, 2024

In an open letter adressed to the U.S. government, 45 American physicians and nurses, who describe themselves as multiethnic and multifaith, testify of what they've seen whilst working in the strip. They state that none of them support the massacre of Oct. 7th, and that a ceasefire and arms embargo for both sides is necessary.  Practically everyone in the strip, including aid workers and Israeli hostages, is seemingly sick, injured or both. The signators all lost weight rapidly despite their privileged position. Virtually every child under the age of five they encountered had watery diarrhea or a cough. 

**Every single signatory testified to having treated pre-teen children who were deliberately targeted**, specifically having been shot in the head and chest. They claim that half of the strip's healthcare resources had been destroyed by Israel, and that one in 40 health workers in Gaza had been killed. According to stories told to them by other health workers in Gaza who were taken by Israel in the attacks on the hospitals, they had been physically and psychologically abused, and finally being dumped naked on the side of a road. Israel is actually blocking physicians of Palestinian descent entry, even American citizens, which the signatories protest as racist and discriminatory, which also means that none of the signatories are ethnically Palestinian. 

Now, one thing, which is kinda fishy with the letter, is that the **vast majority of the signators, with only a handful of exceptions, have Arab names,** which of course puts the neutrality into question. But you'd still be hard-pressed to find former medical workers of Gaza who support Israel after their experience there. Is the experience of working at a hospital in a war zone so traumatising, that anyone in said position would hate the foreign party just for inflicting the suffering on the patients they had to help, or is this testimony worth considering?"

Hey -- super uninformed American college student here with a quick qquestion. So, being a college student in the US, you hear a lot of horrible shit about Israel from your classmates, and I have a hard time telling how much of it is true. 

There's this one thing I keep hearing from some of my friends, that Israel's war in Gaza is a front for/will otherwise end in Israel annexing the Gaza strip. I know that Israel is expanding in the West Bank, so it's not the most implausible idea that they'd do it there too? But I also know that they pulled settlements out of the Westbank in 2005, so that would seem to suggest otherwise.

Is Israel planning on annexing Gaza and establishing settlements there? Do Israelies here that from their government and is it something they're interested in? Would appreciate sources"
1eiawx6,What about the children there?,2024-08-02 14:05:25,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eiawx6/what_about_the_children_there/,"So i had this question on my mind for some time now, and i bet that a lot of other people as well.

Why dont pro palestinian protestors protest about (literally) any other war or conflict in the world in which terrorism is involved and millions of people die including huge number of children, but are only focusing on the Israeli-Palestinian current war which has received more media outlet ratings than almost all other world conflicts combined(maybe even more than ukraine back in 22)?

So first lets establish some ground rules, i realize many of you will now say, you are trying to gaslight the current conflict and Israel's crimes, but thats false i ask this question on the basis that in the pro palestinian nerrative Israel is commiting crimes and they have been boycotted, protested against and all the things that were done after october 8th, so lets imagine this is true and Israel deserves it, what about the other horrible wars, conflicts and terrorist attacks in Yemen, Somalia and Ethiopia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Central African republic, Sudan, Myannmar, North korea's crimes and many many more huge wars/conflicts that happen/happened in the past decade, why dont yall protest about them as well? Why when Yemeni girl school is blown up the world is silent? Why when a Syrian family is blown apart and an entire town has no water or food the world is silent?

I am not saying this as a comperison between Israel/Palestine to these conflicts i ask why do we NEVER see anything regarding these huge problems as well?

This video made me want to raise this question in this sub, it explains it way better than me

1eialzl,"""Supporters"" and Their Self-Righteous Attitudes",2024-08-02 13:52:35,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eialzl/supporters_and_their_selfrighteous_attitudes/,"One of the bigger issues with this conflict in my opinion is the way its discussed by people who are not affected by it in any way, shape, or form, and use it to one-up people online or act smug and self-righteous.              

I can really recognize these attitudes because I remember seeing them in myself when I was a teenager on the internet. But over the years of living in a place like Israel and you begin to understand the feeling of any moment being your last and the panic of war and terror.              

And even in expressing this I acknowledge that many people in this conflict have it much much worse, I'm not trying to say that I'm suffering more than anyone else, but it's infuriating to see people totally unaffected act all smarmy because they think they're checkmating their opponent in an argument.                  

I feel like this is really common in modern discussion of certain issues, the people who are less or not affected by the real problems have no problem being flagrantly ignorant or arrogant, they don't care about how they're representing the issue because they are not affected by it. No outcome will cause anything more than just feeling bad. Their lives aren't on the line.                 

This isn't just true about the I/P conflict, I think it's true when it comes to a lot of issues, but this is the issue that directly affects me living here and it's mind-boggling the way people talk about it online.             

I can't imagine talking so callously about a conflict that results in dead and kidnapped children, broken families, and constant fear and anxiety for the people living through it."
1ei7nyk,Strike killing WCK workers deemed accident,2024-08-02 11:29:35,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ei7nyk/strike_killing_wck_workers_deemed_accident/,"According to independent australian research, the strike on a wck vehicle that was transporting goods, was an accident.

For those who havent heard about this incident or forgot, the truck was one amongst a convoy of 3 vehicles that had just delivered supplies to a storage facility in deir-al balah when it got hit by an israeli airstrike. 

7 people passed away as a result of this strike, amongst wich a palestinian driver and polish, british and australian humanitarian aid workers.

According to the australian air force officer that was sent to investigate the incident, the israeli airforce misidentified the armed guards that were also in the vehicle to protect the workers, as terrorists who had captured the vehicle and decided to launch a strike.

Besides that, due to a communication issue, local IDF forces were not fully aware of the fact that a WCK convoy was moving trough the area, wich likely gave the commanding officers more reason to be suspicious of the convoy.

According to the australian minister of foreign affairs, the personnel responsible for this strike should be held responsible for this occurence, even potentially by proscecution if it is deemed nessecary. She has also said that tjis was not a singular occurence, with 250 humanitarian aid workers now killed in the duration of this conflict and she states that there should be more done to secure the safety of humanitarian workers.

As for my opnion on this,

I personally definetly disagree with how israel has handled this conflict for the most part, but i do think that they handled this incident very well, by allowing the precense of an indepent researcher and by (assumably) being very transparent with the officer, this case could be resolved quite quickly and efficiently, and i do hope they resolve more incidents in this manner.

I do however also agree with the australian minister on the fact the the peesonnel responsible should be held accountible. Even if it was a mistake, it was one that cost the lives of seven people and getting off with that spot free is not right, although any kind of reprecussion in the form of jail time or anything like that does seem a bit harsh to me.

As for the source on all this, i unfortunatly only have one from a dutch news site since the news is very recent. (its goverment owned and very reliable from what i kniw, so dont wlery about that) Isra√´l doodde hulpverleners niet met opzet, volgens Australisch onderzoek - https://nos.nl/l/2531403
I will add in a english source as soon as i have one.

Edit: here is an english source, wich also gives the offcial statement from the australian minister

1ei29l4,What's left for Israel to win in Gaza?,2024-08-02 05:34:37,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ei29l4/whats_left_for_israel_to_win_in_gaza/,"State of the conflict:

Hamas is pretty well knocked down. with much of their top brass Deif, Haniyeh, Issa and others dead. The scale of the conflict seems to have dropped significantly in Gaza. With only a handful of rockets being fired.

Only sinwar remains in Gaza (thousands of fighters and a lot of hostages), and the political leaders in Qatar. However this is still more than enough to restore territorial control. And Iran will be doing all it can to attempt to rearm them.

Growing risks for Israel:

More personal will be needed on the northern front with Hezbollah and intelligence will be turning to face Iranian threat.

They will still be receiving weapons, direct missile defence and plenty of intelligence support from their allies. But the  US democrats are unlikely to give them offensive support beyond this until after the elections.

However, Israel very much has the capacity to run offense and defence. This is a scenario they have been expecting and preparing for over decades.

Potential of deal:

It was clear hamas was not offering a deal that netanyahu could accept. But with mossad showing their leaders and even their IRGC funders that they are personally at risk. Will we see a reasonable offer? 

However if their conviction is strong they know there are many other leaders who could still rise in the ranks. Plenty of the leaders themselves got there by killing their competition and predecessors. Hamas still remains popular with the majority of Palestinians, particularly in the west bank.
This could well be why the IDF has gone for the body of the snake before the head.

What is left to declare victory and what will that look like?"
1ei0thw,Is the average Jew and Palestinian aware that they‚Äôre genetically cousins?,2024-08-02 04:11:18,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ei0thw/is_the_average_jew_and_palestinian_aware_that/,"Jews and their various subdivisions within their ethnoreligious tribe (Ashkenazim, Sephardim, Mizrahim, Italkim, etc) primarily descend from Judean exiles that left the Levant to places such as Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, Iran, Morocco, Tunisia, etc. In the diaspora, these Jewish exiles would later intermarry with local women who converted to Judaism and thus adopted their customs. 

In contrast, Palestinians are primarily the descendants of native Levantine populations, some of whom have ancient Jewish or Samaritan origins. I believe Palestinian Christians and Samaritans have the most Levantine ancestry when compared to Palestinian Muslims and Jewish diasporic populations. However, the military campaigns that besieged the land, such as the Arab conquest of the 7th century, thus initiated a process of Arabization and Islamization through the conversion and acculturation of locals, accompanied by Arab settlement. 

Therefore, due to the numerous cultural changes that permeated the land, such as the adoption of Christianity and Islam, Palestinian families who originally descend from ancient Jewish or Samaritan origins no longer identify as such or have little knowledge of this ancient connection. 

From my research and anecdotal experience with both populations, it‚Äôs funny that the Jews and Palestinians in my life consider each other foreigners when, in reality, they‚Äôre more similar than alike. Politically, I‚Äôm a proponent of a one-state solution under a secular government. Still, it seems that idea is not possible due to the conflict that continues to escalate each day. However, I thought that if both populations became informed of their shared ancestries, maybe that could help initiate more discussions for a possible solution. 

Thank You!

 Yet, get quickly it became obvious to me that this channel has been moderated by mainly pro Israel admins. 

Watching its history and how it evolved it's very easy to recognize how pro-Palestinian comments are very often censored, deleted etc.

I was banned from posting here for a month in a conversation where I was constantly attacked by pro Israel commenters with comments that clearly violate the community guidelines. And instead of their comments being deleted I got banned from answering them. 

Do you also feel this channel is censored? 
Have you noticed the pro Israel administration of it? 

Do you believe this channel gives a balanced view of this conflict? 

I believe that being able to discuss this topic in a civilized manner is crucial for peace. I'm sure I've also lost my nerve while responding to some of the comments. 

But I still believe this channel is being censored to mainly present one day. 

I'm sure this post will also be deleted. Which will be proof that the admins don't really allow any critical view of the channel itself.

1ehs9sw,What Would an Ideal One-State Solution Look Like to You?,2024-08-01 21:23:47,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ehs9sw/what_would_an_ideal_onestate_solution_look_like/,"On paper a two-state solution makes more sense,  but in practice it has proven to be practically impossible. Personally, I am pro two-state solution, and I don't think efforts in getting that to work should stop, but I am curious to hear opinions about some of the other options - namely a one-state solution. 

Obviously there are extremists on both sides saying things like ""it should be our state only, they just need to get out/go back to where they came from"". That is obviously not feasible and would likely only lead to oppression and violence, so I am not looking for that as an answer (unless you have some extremely compelling evidence about a way to feasibly and non-violently convince an an entire population of people, Israel or Palestine, to willingly and peacefully leave their homes and go to another country.) 

I know that on the Israeli side many want to just see Palestine absorbed into Israel under the current system they have set up. I do see the appeal to this as Israel has at least somewhat of a functioning Democracy (despite Bibi's best efforts). The reason I don't think this would work however is that many Palestinians associate the current Israeli government, and it's key figures, with the deaths of their innocent loved ones. Forcing them to accept that as their new government would be extremely difficult and cruel. Also, Israel is a Jewish state, and I cant see a large number of a different ethnic/religious group being content living under a government that prioritizes a belief/cultural system that they do not associate with. 

I know that currently around 25% of the Israeli population is not Jewish and it has been okay\*\*\* for them, but if it were to absorb Palestine in it's entirety the population distribution would look something like: 

* **Jewish**: 47.4%
* **Muslim**: 48.2%
* **Others**: 4.4%

(If my math is wrong please correct me). 

Given that Muslim's would now be of equal relevance to the overall population, I highly doubt they would willingly accept living under the pretenses of their state being Jewish. Do you disagree with this?

From my perspective, it seems like the only way for one state solution to be feasible at all is if all current governments are completely dismantled and a new, secular, bi-partisan democratic government is built. To mitigate accusations of impartiality with the new structure, there would have to be a 3rd party that oversees the construction of the new government and subsequent elections, then remove itself from the government all together (be that a U.N. appointed group, a coalition of other countries, or the United States). I understand there would be a lot of complexities to this, and opposition from both sides, so I know this isn't necessarily any more feasible, but to me it seems like the only way a 1-state has a chance at working.

1ehqh9l,‚ÄãLogical Democratic Party‚Äã plan for ‚Äãprimarily Arab Druza (Palestinian) Golan Heights‚Äã (of Israel). ,2024-08-01 20:11:14,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ehqh9l/logical_democratic_party_plan_for_primarily_arab/,"In addition to earlier work in a [Golan Heights related topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ee6jkq/development_from_hezbollah_rocket_kills_10_not/) ‚Äãhas been a short clear statement representative of the people to work from in this video:

[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lL4D8137xM8](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lL4D8137xM8)

The once divided ‚ÄãGolan Heights ‚Äãhas ‚Äãthrough tragedy come of age‚Äã, on the world stage.

This predominantly Druze area now almost take‚Äãs for granted Israeli citizenship‚Äã, ‚Äãwhich now is the only thing saving them from being powerless like Druze ‚Äãcommunities in Lebanon and Syria‚Äã now are. ‚ÄãGolan Heights can instead help get Islamic Jihad out of their other cultural territories. Eliminating Hezbollah makes partner Hamas easier to rid from the south end of Israel.

Instead of just ""Israel '' to communicate with there is now Golan Heights, where it's now a whole other Israel‚Äã, with great influence on surrounding Druze communities. They have 1000+ years of experience with periodic return of the same Islamic Jihad as always, coming at them from the north.

What ‚Äãnow makes their dreams come true is for Kamala to recognize their warrior past, and experience, by including in all future plans regarding conflicts in the northmost end of Israel. They want that control, but have to go through all of the rest of the Israeli government to reach the USA, then back the other way back to them. Even where Israel does all it can it's much easier for our administration to recognize, by including all concerned in Golan Heights. ‚ÄãKamala does not have to go though the usual unpopular leaders of ""Israel"" proper.

With all the exciting new things happening in the Democratic Party, what Golan Heights became fits right in as a torch being passed‚Äã, to ‚Äãworthy ""Palestinians"" who properly use the word, for a region once called Palestine where Jews and Druze lived together all along. To them it's like a United States of Palestine ‚Äãlike at /UnitedStatesPalestine already exists in thought. Around 1/3 of what matters to the‚Äãir state of Israel‚Äã, with the will and firepower to win one more for their people. It's not throwing money, it's eliminating their frustration over being overlooked like they don't exist.

The Druze culture and religion is very closed in a way that can sound cult-like. To be fair I had to look for other warning signs. But they keep to themselves instead of converting. Beliefs contain the peaceful best of all religions in the region, in the 11 century, including India.

Druze have a reincarnation based perspective that works with my scientific thoughts on what might be possible, in a reincarnation type ongoing way. Other than Islamic Jihad they coexist well with others. No news at all from the Golan Heights, until Hezbollah crossed their line, proves it.

Golan Heights turned out to be a role-model community, where in science I would have to say Druze had a mutual symbiosis going with Jews, Christians and others who also specialize in various trade/survival related niches, needed for a more complex society by each doing their thing that makes all the rest better off.

Golan Heights is predominantly Druze, but we have to remember to credit various religions living in harmony together all along, where there is teamwork that made the community survivors for this long. We are seeing that now by how well they fit in with Jewish and other religions in the IDF, only had to want to.

Well trained career soldiers and ‚Äãexperienced community leaders‚Äã are for all the right reasons‚Äã focused on Hezbollah‚Äã, only, and in my opinion deserve to ‚Äãbe empower‚Äãd by ‚ÄãKamala introducing to the world as I just did‚Äã, specifically as Golan Heights (not rest of Israel that gets all the news headlines) becoming part of her team.

Their collective use of the word ""Palestinian"" to include their friends of other religions is a role model I have to stand by them on as in [Rachel Platten - Stand By You‚Äã](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwB9EMpW8eY&list=PLPCENRDc3DcTAW6uMMi3HNjF8Fvpn6vWx)

This at the same time eliminates the extremely dangerous UN muddling making the citizens of the Golan Heights easy prey to Islamic Jihad, by associating them with a people who all look the same and of identical religion who deserve all of Israel including Golan Heights and represent them by blocking traffic and trashing colleges. In this case it's part of their vocabulary in a proper way, whenever they on their own talk about fellow Palestinians in other areas. It's like the United States of Palestine already exists in a tri-state area where they already have to cross the borders like Rhode Island into Massachusetts, or Connecticut. Expect at most a welcome sign. Gaza should be the same, but that's what happens when Hamas gets control of the UN through [UNRWA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3__xoH9vgAI).

Golan Heights Palestinains are an exception. Don't need a Palestinian authority, or anything else, only open communication with Golan Heights leaders who are being left out and ignored by not making shocking headlines daily. Only need simple giving credit where due, at a time when they most need the USA government to recognize they exist.

The rest of Israel wants them to have what they need to do minimal damage to the other areas of their once named Palestine region with no borders like now. Three states like the USA with no stops to get to the other addis up to a larger region they called Palestine and still feel connected to, before Britain lost control then post WW2 redrawing of lines dividing three separate political environments who now all suffer from Hezbollah making it unsafe to freely move at will between states/territories.

Palestine as they recall it from history, is then environmentally as it was by just being drivable again without fear travelling between north Syria, Lebanon and Golan Heights of Israel. It Is then up to them to more formally declare having achieved a United States of Palestine‚Äã, ‚Äãwhere as long as one of the three is strong the other two survive. Best of three worlds where borders and such remain the same. No land is going from one to another. Just united again as one predominantly (but not entirely) Druze area, efficiently working as one, like before.

Golan Heights would in turn make all citizens in the state of Israel Palestinians again, without needing a new passport. It's a noticeable change back to before all the chaos that is like fencing in their habitat. They become the rightful example of what it is to genuinely act in the best interests of ""Palestians"" without Israel having to do more than roll their eyes, at what automatically becomes logically true in regards to open borders in a geographical area that are united in mind enough to behaviorally qualify as a United States, of something.

The diverse Golan Heights ""Palestinians"" now in the news are a way out of the otherwise damned if you do damned if you don't ""Palestinian issue"" through their example of 12 of their kids killed by Hezbollah being too much. Jihad honoring Druze deaths as martyrs as in Gaza added to the insult. Part of how they slowly assimilate identity to make it look like they represent the people in a region that's next to be conquered.

Kamala Harris has the power to change everything, by recognizing the Golan Heights (Palestinians) as a surprisingly honorable role model, to go forward into a new administration with, to contrast what she rightfully considered to be senseless vandalism.

Palestinians who actually live in the once Palestine region will for real be more involved than ever in history, without need to protest outside the White House. Kamala ended that need, by empowering Arab Palestinians able to understand and make wise choices about how to handle Jihad, coming in from the north through into Gaza, at its source.

‚ÄãThere has never been an example like this of what else there can be going on‚Äã, besides what ‚Äãusually comes out of colleges. Be‚Äãcomes what they next teach‚Äã. Came from Golan Heights, to ‚Äãmake the ‚Äãassociated protests ‚Äãof the old a thing of the past‚Äã. It's not forced on anyone, it's adapting to new information and current events becoming history, fast. Week ago 99% had never heard of Druze before, or what's going on in Golan Heights these days. It took this much text, just to properly introduce this Arab Palestinian connection with apparent influence from India, to Democratic Party politics, just in time for the election fun."
1eho4na,I'm tired of people bashing on Israelis/Jews that doesn't mention anything about the conflict.,2024-08-01 18:34:43,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eho4na/im_tired_of_people_bashing_on_israelisjews_that/,"Whenever there's a post on social media relating to Israel or Judaism, or when the poster is Israeli/Jewish, there's always people screaming ""Free Palestine"" and calling them Zionist pigs even when it has nothing to do with the conflict. When an Israeli makes a middle eastern dish, they cry that the food is being stolen and we're claiming it as our own. When an Israeli says ""habibi"" or makes any sort of middle eastern reference, they cry that we're stealing their culture. You don't hear people crying that Mexicans stole the doner kebab from Turkey and calling it al pastor. As an Israeli, It's honestly hurtful. We can't go a day without embracing our culture just for us to be called ethno-cleansing genocide Zionist pigs.

I also see the same thing when Palestine is mentioned, how pro-Israelis calls them terrorists that kidnaps and murders babies. There's a lot more to both countries than the conflict, just like every other country, but people are more pressed about it.

I know it's social media, and people are more extreme about it and it's better to ignore it, but again, not everything has to be about the conflict. Me being Israeli or Jewish doesn't make me a supporter of genocide, or you being Palestinian or Muslim doesn't make you a supporter of terrorism.

Maybe this post isn't the most well-thought out that doesn't belong to this sub-reddit, but I just wanted to make this post because I haven't seen any discussions about this so far, and I was just curious on your guys' thoughts about this."
1ehn9dd,How do you defend the Right-Wing riots in Israel?,2024-08-01 17:59:43,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ehn9dd/how_do_you_defend_the_rightwing_riots_in_israel/,"This sub has always been very pro-zionist & anti-Palestinian, and its very hard to find fair ground or have a balanced discussion free of racism. I've seen people on this sub defend the Israeli state against pretty much everything & anything, so I wanted to ask this, how do you defend the Far Right Extremist riots that have taken over Sde Teiman in defence of IDF soldiers that participated in the sodomy & rape of a Palestinian prisoner.

The Israeli military arrested 9 IDF soldiers suspected of brutally sexually abusing a Palestinian captive to the point that the captive couldn't walk due to the severe injuries to his rectum. The soldiers being arrested posted on social media & within hours flocks of right wing nationalists stormed the detention centre where they were being held in support for the soldiers, calling it ""shameful"" that they were arrested, despite how awful & inhumane their treatment of the ""prisoner"" was. 

The abhorrent part is that they weren't protesting the validity of the allegations, but the protestors believed that the soldiers did nothing wrong. The protestors, alongside right wing leaders like Ben-Gvir & Smotrich called those soldiers heroes. There was even a video released of the Knesset arguing the validity of the torture charges, where one member even argues that there is ""no limit"" to what can be done to Palestinian detainees. He also argues it very angrily. So basically, they're debating whether RAPE is okay when its used against Palestinians, and the worst part is that most of the protestors were arguing for it to be okay.

Now thankfully there were some Israelis that were horrified with this, but the problem that Im getting to is that the majority were okay with the mistreatment & abuse of Palestinians, and that these right wing extremists have become more common in Israeli society. I ask you this, how is this not a society facing moral decay? How did it even reach the point where hatred & extremism has become so far spread & worst off, so accepted by society? Are these really the ""Western"" values we share? I understand that the Oct 7 attacks have spread paranoia across Israel, but surely Oct 7 cant justify the intentional torture, abuse and rape of all Palestinian detainees. 

Hatred is never the answer, and collectively blaming ALL Palestinians for Oct 7 is not an answer either. So, how do you explain this level of inhumanity that seems to be so accepted in Israeli society."
1ehhl93,What do you think of the latest John Oliver‚Äôs Last Week Tonight Episode on West Bank,2024-08-01 14:07:43,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ehhl93/what_do_you_think_of_the_latest_john_olivers_last/,"First, If you haven't already, feel free to go watch the latest episode of [John Oliver's Last Week Tonight regarding the West Bank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqK3_n6pdDY), just released on YouTube by HBO.

So full disclosure before I start: I'm neither Jewish nor Palestinian and have only started looking into issues in that region since October 7th. I am firmly against terrorism and support the rights of both Israelis and Palestinians to coexist. However, my focus has mostly been on Gaza, and I haven't done enough research on the West Bank. That‚Äôs why, when John Oliver finally did an episode on the West Bank, I found it very interesting.

John Oliver has historically been a political satirist, so I'm on the fence about how seriously to take this episode. I want to ask a few questions here and get opinions on the content of the episode to gain a more holistic view of the West Bank issue.

Firstly, is the West Bank really an apartheid region? If yes, does that make Israel an apartheid state?

Israel has strongly rejected the claim that it is an apartheid state, citing the fact that there is a large population of Arab Israelis living as equals to their Jewish counterparts, actively involved in all aspects of Israeli life, including politics. However, John Oliver claimed that in the West Bank, it‚Äôs a completely different scenario: Palestinians there are subjected to military laws, while Israeli settlers enjoy regular laws and significantly more freedom and privileges. How true is that claim? Does this reality alone categorize the West Bank as an apartheid region? Is that why many are criticizing Israel as an apartheid state? Is that a fair evaluation based on a regional conflict?

Secondly, do the settler interviews and stories featured in this episode represent the majority view and reality of the entirety of Israel?

The opinions of the settlers and IDF soldiers in the episode seem very aggressive and firmly against a two-state solution. They voiced their disdain for the Palestinians and seemed intent on driving them out and grabbing as much land as possible. The episode claims that Palestinians can‚Äôt really get permits to do any construction. How accurate is this depiction compared to the actual reality? Are those settlers really like colonizers trying to drive Palestinians out, and can they get away with it with the government‚Äôs backing? What about the broader viewpoints of the whole of Israel? While there were segments in the video where other Israelis called out how bad the situation is in the West Bank, John Oliver made it seem like most of the Israeli population is intentionally trying to colonize the West Bank. How true is that?

Lastly, is Netanyahu and his far-right coalition ultimately to blame? How was the situation prior to Netanyahu‚Äôs term, and if he gets voted out in the next term, would the West Bank situation improve?

John Oliver mentioned that settlers have been trying to move there for a few decades now and that it is breaking international law and the Oslo Accords. Why were the settlers allowed to move there in the first place if it‚Äôs clearly against the Oslo agreement? Why would the Israeli government allow it prior to Netanyahu? And why would settlers want to go there in the first place to live in ‚Äúconstant fear of conflict‚Äù? Was it just because the land cost nothing and it was a land-grab movement? Did Netanyahu simply continue an existing Israeli government stance? Is it safe to say that there will never be a two-state solution even after Gaza is free of Hamas if the West Bank issue isn't resolved? I ultimately want to know where the hearts of the Israeli people are because clearly, the settlers featured in the video don‚Äôt want to coexist."

- Beloved Abu Obaida, hit and destroy Tel Aviv 

- Put the sword against the sword, we are Mohammed Deif's (The architect of 07 October Attack) men

- The whole world stands with Hamas. Allahu Akbar

They scream about freedom for Palstine but about freedom of press they forgot. After getting exposed in a local newspaper they decided to protest near the reporter's house, probably to intimidate her and other reporters from telling the truth about them. They don't think of freedom of speech as value, what they really want is to shut down every possible critic and hide their true narative - support for terrorists like Hamas and Hezbollah.

Here is the first article that exposes the true face. A reporter who speaks arabic decided to visit one of their weekly protests in Malmo.

1eh8yti,Why does no one talk about CUFI?,2024-08-01 05:37:16,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eh8yti/why_does_no_one_talk_about_cufi/,"CUFI: ""Christians United for Israel (CUFI) is a Christian Zionist organization in the United States that supports Israel.¬†Its goal is to give a national voice to pro-Israel churches, ministries, parachurch organizations, and individuals in the United States on issues related to the Bible.¬†CUFI is the largest Zionist organization in the country, with over 10 million members.""

I've really noticed that no one is talking about this lobbying group nearly as much as they are mentioning AIPAC. In fact, I haven't heard anything about this organization from those around me. Media bias is an issue that has profoundly impacted how information is conveyed and received by all of the people we are surrounded by. Observing how this bias can lead to disproportionate coverage is truly fascinating and concerning. We have seen some topics, groups, and organizations being highlighted more than others. Personally I have seen this in the relative obscurity of Christians United for Israel (CUFI). Despite being a significant organization advocating for strong U.S.-Israel relations, many people I encounter are unaware of CUFI or its influence. This has really raised questions about the nature of media coverage for me: why are some organizations like CUFI not prominently covered? AIPAC I've noticed is always in the media; however, I have yet to hear CUFI being mentioned to even a slight degree. The lack of coverage has not only affected public awareness but also shaped public opinion by limiting the information available."
1eh6ol6,A pro-Palestinian apologizing ,2024-08-01 03:25:39,90,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eh6ol6/a_propalestinian_apologizing/,"If you look at my comment and post history I've been a very vocal and overt supporter of Palestine. I received a few comments on my last comment that made me think deeply about my stance and emotional state.

I stood back and observed my own behavior and I didn't recognize myself. I was looking at my enemy (in the making.)

I would like to start by apologizing for fighting hate with hate. I know what I said and its goal was to hurt people who I felt stood for hurting innocent civilians. 

*Background*
I'm a Shia Muslim from Pakistan and we've always been persecuted but Americans/Israeli made/armed entities like the Taliban (Google Operation Cyclone)

I migrated/escaped to the US to start a family away from the wars created by the US only to experience severe hatred. 9/11 was somehow every Muslims fault and then Trump (the secret hidden voice of the fascist side of the nation) happened.

The war in Iraq really did a number on me. The media and legal system were very strict about any content that came out of Iraq. A million plus killed by US troops and I was told to stay quiet and keep my head down.

I've always followed The content of people like Norm Finkelstein and Gabor mate when it comes to Israel. Who better than an Ex Zionist to explain their path to clarity.

After October 7th the Jewish voices like Katie Halper, Norm Finkelstein, Glenn Greenwald, Rich Siegel, Gabor Mate and countless others woke up shame in me. I wanted to scream at someone for the blood curling cruelty I was seeing executed with indifference by Zionism in Palestine.

Helpless to fight against the terrorist myself I felt I needed to do something. 

I screamed on LinkedIn (lost my job - boss was Ex IDFü§£)

I screamed on Reddit and found out how many others were pent up and screaming as well.

But screaming is an attack. I slowly got aggressive to a point where I needed to hurt with words.

In my last comment I wished death and illness and calamity on my enemy (and the enemy of humanity).

*Reflection*

Then I thought to myself... What about my enemy's kids. I pray 5 times a day and after every prayer I ask God to protect my Palestinian brothers and sisters . And right after I say ""my lord show their enemies defeat and do not count me amongst their enemies"" 
But then I thought God is just. Why would he allow the massacre of innocence? Well I read some Quran and realized he did in the past. 

All Muslims must believe in Prophet Moses(peace be upon him) as an Abrahamic prophet. Jews and Christians to us are ""people of the book."" We can marry them and eat food they make (unlike say if a Hindu makes food) 

The reason I say this is because the Quran call all children of Israel God's ""chosen people"" and  they went through hell in a basket during the time of the Pharos and more after their exile.

*Conclusion* 
It is not up to me to seek or pary for or wish for punishment for the wrong doers. I am not the judge. 

To all Zionist: I apologies for my harsh words and ill wishes. I disagree with your narrative that Jews = Zionist. But I'm not going to work on convincing or trying to hurt you through words.

I pray we all get what we have earned through our actions in this world and offer an apology for my aggressive words/actions. I wish you the best in your journey to please God and pray for the safety of my Palestinian brothers and sisters. God is sufficient protector."

However, I'm sure we all know here that so many of the organizations, especially UNRWA, collaborates with Hamas are inherently corrupt. However, there are many for which corruption is more difficult to uncover. For instance, it's actually reasonably difficult to connect the PCRF with its involvement housing Hamas operations and Israeli hostages at Al-Rantisi Hospital (named after the founder of Hamas who swore the murder of all Jews).  

I would like to know which relief organizations carry this corruption and which ones do not so I can draw others to the best use of their funds in my community. I'm sure this will open debate but everything's such a mess that I feel debate may be needed to get to the bottom of things. 

I would like to help, myself, but I currently don't see any pathway for my hard earned money to actually reach a family in Gaza. "
1egvit7,The assassination of Haniyeh is the type of attack Pro-Palestinians claim Israel should engage in,2024-07-31 19:08:07,279,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1egvit7/the_assassination_of_haniyeh_is_the_type_of/,"The assassination of Ismail Haniyeh is precisely the type of attack Pro-Palestinian advocates have claimed - since the start of the war - Israel should engage in. A precise targeted attack on a leader with zero civillian casualties. And yet, everyone is now claiming that Israel crossed a red line.

Over the past few months, as Gaza has been destroyed, activists have shouted about collective punishment and that Israel should only target Hamas and leave civillians alone. Ignoring for a second that Hamas hides amongst civillians and purposefully shields themselves with innocents -- the assassination in Iran is exactly the type of action anti-Israel activists argue Israel should be doing exclusively. And now he's being propped up, for bizarre reasons, as a peace-oriented statesman when there is much evidence to the contrary. And let's not forget Haniyeh saying on live TV that the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian innocents is worth it as part of the never-ending struggle to liberate Jerusalem from Isrel.

The hypocrisy is nothing new, but certainly worth pointing out. Haniyeh was part of a terrorist organization responsible for the death of thousands. If anything, Haniyeh's work not only resulted in the deaths of thousands, but he was a skilled terrorist politician who helped create and foster relationships with other terrorist entities across the Middle East.

The larger conclusion here is that it seems that many Pro-Palestinian activists simply don't wan't Israel to fight back in any way. If even a targeted assassination of a top Hamas figure that leaves no civillians injured is crossing a line, it seems as if the only thing Israel is ""allowed"" to do is nothing.

This of course isn't anything new. It's as if the world is mad Israel takes steps to protect itself. 

It remains to be seen how the death of Haniyeh impacts the region. Iran will of course respond, perhaps with a coordinated attack involving Hezbollah and the Houthis. 

One thing is for sure - Hamas' October 7 calculations have gone wildly astray. The only thing they have achieved is negative PR for Israel - meanwhile Hamas is slowly being dismantled and its leaders are being picked off one by one. All the while, the mass release of Palestinian prisoners has not happened because Hamas still refuses to ceasefire terms."

1egtr04,So what now?,2024-07-31 17:57:33,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1egtr04/so_what_now/,"Hard to imagine we're getting closer and closer to the one year mark.

Since this war has started, Israel has more or less destroyed Gaza, but are still fighting Hamas and other Palestinian Islamist terror groups in different parts of Gaza.

Beyond Gaza, the war has extended to Lebanon, to Syria, to Iran and even parts of Yemen.

And now, Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas has been assassinated. Another Hezbollah figure in Lebanon as well.

While I clearly would welcome this, the question remains what happens now.

-What happens to Gaza, will there be a total victory there now, given that ceasefire talks are less likely than ever?

-Is Hezbollah going to react using its massive arsenal, bringing doom to all of Lebanon? Will Israel intervene by pushing a buffer zone again in Southern Lebanon?

-Will IRAN, having basically pulled punches last time, actually respond militarily?

Are we now, unlike previous moments, about to enter a massively destructive phase of this war? Will the US get involved?



Would be curious to hear the views from all sides, and whether Netanyahu has now become almost trustworthy in his push for total victory:



Does anyone think Israel will make any territorial gains, annexations from this war?



Or will this war just end up messy and in a number of stalemates, which will outlast Netanyahu and plague Israel for years?



What will happen with Iran? Will a huge spike in direct hostilities solidify the rule of mullahs for years to come?

1egsifu,I‚Äôm a foreign Jew living in Israel; here are my thoughts,2024-07-31 17:07:57,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1egsifu/im_a_foreign_jew_living_in_israel_here_are_my/,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôm a Jewish guy living in Israel for six months as part of a gap-year program. If you want to be a dick about it, fine. But I hope you‚Äôll come to understand my thought process and appreciate the nuance of my view. 

I grew up in a traditionally Jewish and Zionist household/community in the Diaspora (any country outside of Israel). I‚Äôm gonna leave Judaism aside because my concern right now is about Israel. But pretty much everyone I know is Jewish, which means that most (but definitely not all) of them are Zionist. If you‚Äôre confused about terminology, Zionism is the support of the Jewish people‚Äôs right to a state in the land of Israel. All notions of Zionism as colonialist, settler-colonialist, or genocidal are not reflections of the original concept of Zionism, although yes, many prominent Zionists espouse colonialist/genocidal ideas towards Palestinians and their deserved statehood. 

I want to leave the politics aside for this post though. If you haven‚Äôt heard, Israel recently killed major leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, Iran-backed terrorist organisations (Hamas being the entity that instigated the Oct 7 attacks). This extrajudicial violence by Israel brings the region on the brink of war (as usual üôÑ). I might be leaving the country. My question is, though, unrelated to war. 

Am I guilty for being here? 

I am a proud Jew. I don‚Äôt believe in god, but I treasure my culture and the mythology of my heritage. But the world is overwhelmingly against Israel. The Gaza war has laid bare the horrific treatment by Israel of the territories it occupies.
If you haven‚Äôt noticed, I am very much against Israel‚Äôs policies towards the occupied territories, as well as the entire Netanyahu administration. The current government is a violent and corrupt shell of what it could be. This doesn‚Äôt mean I am anti-Zionist though; I truly believe that Jews have a right to self-determination and statehood in our ancestral homeland of Israel (yes, ancient Jews did live in Israel. This is an indisputable fact). 

Despite my grievances against Israel, however, I feel it is very unfair for every single Jew to be attacked on all sides for their affiliation with Israel, which is complete bullshit. Many, many Jews, especially young Jews in the diaspora, are not blinded by community or religion, and intensely criticise Israel. Additionally, most zionists are not hateful towards Palestinian people. 

This brings me back to my question of guilt. 

I have always had a guilty complex for any action I take that could be perceived as wrong. But this is too complex for me. Is my being here supportive of violence against Palestinians? Do I even have a right to be scared of being killed in an attack? Social media has intensified my guilt, and the worst part is that some of that guilt could be objectively valid; shouldn‚Äôt I be a strong Jewish voice denouncing Israel‚Äôs atrocities?

But I am so scared of being alienated. If I oppose Israel in my community, I will encounter hate. If I try to place Zionism as valid in non-Jewish spaces I encounter hate. And of course I encounter hate for being Jewish no matter what I do. 

I‚Äôm posting this for insight from others. If you want to hate, hate. It doesn‚Äôt help you or me. But if you have anything constructive to say, be it critical or affirming, please speak. You have no idea how much I value it.

Here‚Äôs to hoping for peace in our time.

The worst part of it all, is that even some of the media outlets have echoed similar sentiment. 

I‚Äôve encountered statements such as:

‚ÄúNothing says peace like murdering the Negotiator.‚Äù

‚ÄúKilling the guy who is trying to make peace is not consistent with wanting peace.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere goes all hope of peace talks; Israel has made their statement that they‚Äôre only interested in more war and death.‚Äù

Ah yes, Ismail Haniyeh, the ambassador of peace, life, and sanctity! We were headed on the right path, minutes away from finalizing a bilateral ceasefire! Now he‚Äôs gone! :(

As a reminder, here are some translated quotes from Haniyeh:

‚ÄúWe are the ones who need this blood, so it awakens within us the revolutionary spirit, so it awakens within us resolve.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe love death like our enemies love life! We love martyrdom, the way in which [Hamas] leaders died.‚Äù

Nothing illustrates a love for death and martyrdom more than avoiding it for 62 years, while being comfortably tucked away in Qatar and other affluent, conflict-free areas in the Middle East, all while amassing billions of dollars at the expense of Palestinian civilians and their plight. His personal interest lies in perpetuating conflict because he and his beneficiaries profit from war and death. Yet, he is considered the key to peace in the Middle East?

But I don't want to be misunderstood as being anti-Semitic, or not supporting safety and a right to stay for the Jewish populace. 
Many support slogans and visuals I have seen highlight the Palestinian cause, and while I do think that their suffering is much worse at the moment, and deeply condemn the Israeli government, I don't want to come across as condemning Jews, or not recognising their right to live and be safe in the region. 

Is there any phrase or symbol that captures this?"

I mean, on one occasion my mom was made to take a photo of her ballot and send it to her employer confirming she voted for the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù party- or she‚Äôd lose her job. Our soldiers also stood with guns above people ‚Äúvoting‚Äù to join Russia in the occupied Ukrainian territories. Our politicians are also known for massively not upholding their promises, and we can‚Äôt un-seat them due to, again, election faud, corruption and deep-seated propaganda 

A common argument for being against Palestine is that ‚Äúthey voted for Hamas. They support their violent terrorist tactics and wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way‚Äù. So I can‚Äôt help but think- what if Hamas
- Falsified election results
- Forced people to vote for them at gunpoint
- Seized control of the government without giving people the chabce to elect someone new
- Made false promises to de-escalate the situation and make peace with Israel, but went a completely different way
- Control the state media to greately misinform the population as to their motives and actual wrongdoings

Or literally did anything else that‚Äôs anti-democratic and goes against the wishes or the general population. It feels to me like the population could be suffering from Hamas as much as the rest of the world.

So I‚Äôm looking for literature that explores this topic and answers these questions in-depth. If anyone could recommend books or maybe lectures, I‚Äôd be very greateful. 

Or maybe just tell me what you know perosnally, I‚Äôd appreciate any opinions and perspectives on the issue.

In a statement, Hamas said he died in:

>""A treacherous Zionist raid on his residence in Tehran‚Äù

The IRGC said:

>""With condolences to the heroic nation of Palestine and the Islamic nation and the fighters of the resistance front and the noble nation of Iran, this morning \[Wednesday\] the residence of Mr. Dr. Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the political office of the Islamic resistance of Hamas, was hit in Tehran, and following this incident, he and one of his bodyguards was martyred.

>The cause and dimensions of this incident are being investigated and the results will be announced later.""

Israel hasn't claimed responsibility or commented (yet). Though far-right Heritage Minister Amichay Eliyahu¬†made some Tweets about it. Musa Abu Marzouk, a senior member of Hamas's political bureau, warned that the elimination of the Haniyeh ""will not pass in silence.""

This comes after Israel's strikes in Lebanon on Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukr the same day, killing at least three people, two children and a woman and injuring 74 others according to the Lebanese health ministry. The IDF claims Shukr died while some sources from Hezbollah say he survived with injuries. The story on Haniyeh just broke less than an hour or so ago so details are scarce and this is still a developing story. While he was in Iran he had attended the swearing-in ceremony of Iran's new president. Not sure what this means exactly for the war or the already-failing ceasefire talks yet but it's certainly a massive development.

India has a minority Muslim population of 14% which percentage wise is smaller than the Arab/Palestinian Israeli population in Israel. Yet we see in the news the politics, religious issues, and just affect that minority has in India but I don‚Äôt see as much information regarding Arab Israelis .

Both sides have done reprehensible things to further their cause, which causes the other side to demonize and hate them even more. It seems like so many people on both sides can't hold the two ideas at the same time that one side has an evil government and so does the other, or that one side has good people and so does the other. It just seems to be a foreign concept. It also seems like a foreign concept that governments are not their people. They have the power to commit atrocities against both the other side and their own people, both of which just have to suffer through it because they can't do anything about it. So why do we pretend that one side is good and the other is evil? Why does nobody want to be told that things are so much more complicated than any of us could possibly hope to understand? 


Like I don't feel comfortable saying to people I don't implicitly trust that I'm pro-Israel but anti-Netanyahu/anti-current-Israeli-regime, AND I'm pro-Palestine but anti-HAMAS/anti-Islamic-Republic. It seems like no matter which side I express this to will bombard me with hate for expressing either of those aspects of the stance as if they contradict each other or that some part of it is reprehensible. Does anyone else feel this way? Does it seem like people are creating a false mutual exclusivity between being pro-Palestine and being pro-Israel? Because I'm both, and I know that a lot of people are, they're just quiet."

I could also see this outbreak seriously affecting the regional politics in the middle east, after all, countries like egypt and israel themselves likely want to avoid the outbreak from spreading into their own countries.

The biggest problem right now however is likely the logistics, after all its not like israel, egypt or any other surrounding nation jist has thousands of polio vaccines ready to send straight into gaza, and i worry that the vaccines will enter the strip way too late to prevent a major outbreak from causing massive casualties within the strip, both to palestinians and israeli's alike, especially considering the fact that historically, diseases have been known to be able to cause massive casualties during war, especially in extreme climates and with very little hygiene available, both of wich are present factors in the majority of the gaza strip.

Finally, i think that from the global community we will just mostly see countries supporting humanitarian organisations with getting as many vaccines into the gaza strip as possible.
Right now i just really hope israel doesnt decide to withild vaccines from the gaza strip, i cant even imagine the global outcry that wluld be caused by that.

Heres an article about the outbreak for anyone who is curious by the way

1efwf2r,I think Israel is the Oppressor,2024-07-30 15:33:57,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1efwf2r/i_think_israel_is_the_oppressor/,"I feel gaslit by this war. I need people to explain to me how Israelis are absolutely *NOT* colonizing Palestine illegally. How did Israel *NOT* forcefully unhouse and rape, and loot the Palestinian villages by the thousands in the 1940s. How would this not be considered the first provocation to what has historically lead to Palestinians loss of basic human needs, rights, and freedoms. How is the starving, segregation and the constant IDF presence at the border, and ongoing illegal settlements not a reason listed as Palestinian anger ever, and why are people quick to label Palestinian anger toward this ""treatment"" as terrorism? Would this and ""Hamas"" not be considered a ""blanket blame"" and how has the term antisemite become a blanket statement for everyone questioning this gvt?

If you respond ""because Hamas"", well I need details, and explanations for the same colonial and violent behaviour before Hamas. I want to know the reason for this defense of Israel linked with anything that convinced you to support Israel and the IDF.

How can pro-Israelis justify the killing of thousands because of ""human shields"" even if they brutalized and emprisoned Palestinians prior to 10/7? Yes some of them are terrorists perhaps, but detainees never go through fair trial or a legal system so how can we be sure these thousands of hostages are all criminals if there is no proof?

The sources I consulted generally point to the IDF as the aggressor, yet this makes people extremely angry. 

Those who support Israel send your sources, explain how you have reached your conclusion. Because these questions are only met with ""Hamas, propaganda, you're an antisemite"". Are arabs not Semites as well? It's a problematic term, meaning hate and prejudice against Jewish people, which people should avoid. But criticizing a gvt is not the same as denying Jewish rights, existence, and identity. Many Jews do not tie their identity to Israel, because it brings them shame, not pride. In fact associating all Palestinians with Hamas and terrorism leading to their deaths would be prejudice.

Before you say it, I guess I do have a side, I'm against Israel's historical treatment of Palestinians and their use of ""terrorism"" and ""antisemite"" to all who criticize the very similar actions they claim terrorists adopted agaisnt them. This leap is in my opinion an extremist view. And the world has become complicit to this unlawful termination based on IDF justification. If you don't want me to call it a genocide fine, I'll use Bassam Youssef's term of ""too much killing"".

Here are some of the sources I consulted that lead me to reach my conclusion on this conflict, if you oppose me, please send your sources:

On anti-zionist Jews

Use of the phrase :Land without a people, for a people without a land by Israel Zangwill.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_land_without_a_people_for_a_people_without_a_land

Zanwill was a Zionist turned anti Zionist. He used to say in 1901: Palestine is a country without a people; the Jews are a people without a country"".[7][15] In a debate at the Article Club in November of that year, Zangwill said ""Palestine has but a small population of Arabs and fellahin and wandering, lawless, blackmailing Bedouin tribes.""[16] ""Restore the country without a people to the people without a country. (Hear, hear.)"". 

Later: Zangwill's views changed and his use of the phrase took on a much different tone. Having ""become fully aware of the Arab peril,"" he told an audience in New York, ""Palestine proper has already its inhabitants. The pashalik of Jerusalem is already twice as thickly populated as the United States,"" leaving Zionists the choice of driving the Arabs out or dealing with a ""large alien population.""

Also: Zangwill told a London court that he had been naive when he made his 1901 speech and had since ""realized what is the density of the Arab population"", namely twice that of the United States.[20] In 1913 he went even further, attacking those who insisted on repeating that Palestine was ""empty and derelict"" and who called him a traitor for reporting otherwise.

Israelism
https://youtu.be/fLHhBXz4XfQ?si=V7HdXLmBnr1-EyBJ
The accounts of Jewish people, Israelis, Palestinians against the Israeli state claiming they felt misled by the indoctrination that to be Jewish means protecting Israel at all costs. Some Ex IDF members voice their opinions, and are shunned by their community just like a cult would treat people who leave and criticize. Similar hate mail and death threats received with many Israelis gatekeeping what Jewish or the Jewish identity means.

I also recently watched Jonathan Glazer's ""The Zone of Interest"" detailing the banality of humans committing and justifying heinous acts against humans. The film does a good job at acknowledging Jewish suffering with very real acts of hate and violence. However, the movie only focuses and directs the visual component to the H√∂ss family house standing right on the other side of the Auschwitz concentration and death camps. It quickly becomes clear that this house is enriched and in bloom because it relies on Jewish death in an organized Nazi system. A system of raping, murdering, and looting which you only. It's also based on the real H√∂ss family, who owned one of the oldest concentration camps, right before they planned to expand the project.

The IDF site is still incredibly vague and does not answer the questions.

I left out a lot of my sources, including details of the recent bombing of Palestinian school U.N designated as a safe zone based on evidence of ennemi presence which never was proved. Including the deaths of 12 Syrian Druze children leading to the Druze criticizing the gvt for it's provication of a bigger war. They do not identify as Israeli, nor muslim religion, they practice a branch of Shia, and haven't bothered anyone.

But as I've listed Israeli sources, I'll also post the investigations conducted by the U.N. and Al Jazeera in the 10/7 aftermath. 
https://youtu.be/_0atzea-mPY?si=8uuz8f0YirRfq6Ub

Those who support Israel have unfortunately provided the least amount of details in this war, preventing me to see the value and legitimacy of the Israeli point of view.

Here is one quote I'll end with from the book *If This Is a Man"" written by Primo Levi documenting the horros of his experience in concentration camps: 

""Monsters exist, but they are too few in number to be truly dangerous. More dangerous are the common men, the functionaries ready to believe and to act without asking questions""."

They obviously cant return to their ancestors' country like Iraq, Syria, Iran, Lybia, Algeria, Yemen and many more so where would they go in this scenario?"
1efq58t,Strong antipathy towards Palestinians,2024-07-30 10:42:38,197,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1efq58t/strong_antipathy_towards_palestinians/,"So this is obviously a problem, because a lot of humans are dying in the war and it's a tragedy. But the way this conflict is handled, by the media, Western lefties, possibly Iranian and Russian bots, makes it really difficult to not become really cemented on one side. For context, I'm neither Israeli nor a Jew, but I grew up with many Jews, so I came into the conflict with an biased but neutral mind. It didn't take me long to become swayed by the absolute lack of humanity from the pro-Palestinian side, examples of which include:

* The absolute unhinged anti-Semitism I see on various social media, such as Twitter and YouTube, and in real life in European cities and American colleges. I'm sure this was always a thing, but now it's becoming justified and acceptable, like people forgot all the lessons of WW2? 

* The unbalanced focus on this conflict, forgetting the absolute bloodbaths occurring in places like Ukraine, Armenia and Sudan. Where are the riots for them? Why is every inch of the internet covered in Palestinian flags, why are anti-Israeli stickers pasted in my apartment building, and protests happening every other day in my city when we're not even remotely involved with either country?

* The incredible cognitive dissonance about 7th October. It's just mind blowing that so many people overtly ignore that Israel is *responding* to a *major* terrorist attack, and not assaulting Gaza just because they feel like it. If you don't begin your plea with 'yes October 7th was horrible, but the I think the response...', you're literally a garbage human. 

* By extension, the follow-up argument that ""history didn't start on October 7th"", yes, it didn't. Arabs have been picking at Israel the entire duration of its existence. To ignore the hostility of that region, and Israel's attempts to coexist, is so ignorant it's mind boggling, like people have lost all common sense.

* The denial of Israel's right to exist. The land was acquired legally and according to international law - people straight up deny this. I have literally read people say something along the lines of, 'well, so what if they used to live there before Palestinians, I can't just go and reclaim some land my ancestor lost in [obscure European town]', then straight away say that Palestinians have right to the land because they were there before the modern Israelis? To be honest, I think both arguments are worthless. The area was around for billions of years before any humans - no one 'owns' it. International lines shift and Palestinians seem to be the only group that can't accept that (which would have more weight if they at least had a Palestinian state to begin with.)

* The overt dishonesty being reported. So-called 'reporters' on Twitter with 500k followers posting clips from unrelated wars and labelling it as another Israel attack, or posting unconfirmed reports before any meaningful information is made public. It's like journalism has lost all its integrity and no one cares.

In the past you could just disconnect and tough grass, but this is really showing the irrational nature of humanity. I would absolutely hate to be a Jew right now just trying to exist - because the only Jewish homeland got attacked and now you're the bad guy (or always have been, according to these folks.) I'm certain the majority of actual Palestinians are normal people who are caught in a crossfire, but their international representatives have been nothing short of disgusting."
1efiy3l,Why Do So Few American Politicians Oppose Israel's War Compared to American Citizens?,2024-07-30 03:06:15,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1efiy3l/why_do_so_few_american_politicians_oppose_israels/,"Israel‚Äôs barbarism in its war against Gaza has become more and more obvious, there has not been serious political consequences for Israel yet.

‚ÄúThen they left him without stitches or care. Just these basic first aid measures. Of course, as you can see, Muhammed was dead for a period of time already because he was abandoned. We thought he wasn't at home. But it turned out he had been bleeding and left alone at home all this time. Of course, the army left him.‚Äù

Some polls suggest that growing numbers of Americans support a ceasefire deal but there is little support for a ceasefire by elected officials. According to the most Gallup poll I could find, 75% of Democrats, 60% of independents and almost a third of republicans 30%, oppose Israel's actions in Gaza.[ ~Collectively~](https://news.gallup.com/poll/642695/majority-disapprove-israeli-action-gaza.aspx) 55% of Americans oppose Israel's actions in Gaza while 36% approve if the polls are anywhere near accurate.¬†

This disapproval is not inconsequential because voters in[ ~swing states~](https://apnews.com/article/muslim-swing-state-biden-vote-fb3b93f465ed6fd34a901c269a084a90) have organized to abandon support for Biden due to his support for Israel's war. Signs that political winds have started to shift against Israel are present but pretty lackluster. Out of the 220 Republicans in the house only three republican voters voted against a bill to fund Israel and the democratic support for the bill was described by Tim Kaine as ‚Äú...much more supportive of the Israel and Ukraine aid bill than Republicans were‚Ä¶""¬†



If support for Israel in the house mirrored the poll numbers of Republicans, 66 Republicans should have voted against the bill to fund Israel. There is some talk about people on the ‚Äúnew right‚Äù or ‚Äúpopulist right‚Äù abandoning support for Israel due to being America first, but I do not really see it. By comparison, 184 Democrats voted against the bill.¬†

My theory is that although more people tacitly oppose Israel's war, few are willing to make it a core issue that drives their voting. The March 1-20 Gallup poll found that (55%) of of Americans rank inflation as the worst problem facing the country followed by crime and violence (53%), hunger/homelessness (52%) and the economy (52%). The movement for Palestine in the United States is far less organized, has less elected influence and has a much weaker media influence than say for example, the Black Lives Matter movement, the LGBT movement etc etc.¬†

I am an interviewer on a team of sound engineers, another podcast host, and a musician producing a podcast called Philosophisnt and we actually interviewed Chase Oliver, the [~Libertarian party candidate for President~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxAA4f-JmZI&t=843s) and Jose Vega, the Lyndon LaRouche Party candidate for Congress in the Bronx. Of the two, [~Jose Vega is far stronger in his support of Palestine~](https://youtu.be/pZ-AVxVQurI?si=jIJ8VLcBalbWjwD1) than Chase is.A major part of his platform is to enact Lyndon LaRouche‚Äôs Oasis Plan to rebuild Palestine and said in a campaign video ‚ÄúI have to fight for the people born in a country marked for death‚Äù.¬† Still Chase Oliver is the only relevant candidate for President I know of who has called for Israel to ‚ÄúEnd the genocide‚Äù. John F Kennedy is very supportive of Israel, and other minor party candidates are hardly making the ballot. In part of the interview, Chase honestly seemed to me like he wanted to back out of what he had said. He made the focus on denouncing any opposition to Israel that may be antisemitic and was vague on what he stood for. By contrast, Jose Vega said that the movement for Palestine has so thoroughly galvanized American young people that it might give them a new source of meaning in life. I was a bit flabbergasted when he said this and did not quite know how to respond, but I do not really see it either. Sadly, it seems like the presidential campaign has pushed the issue of supporting a ceasefire more into the background as the media cycle has now moved on to speculating about how many celebrities will support Kamala Harris.

1efgxzr,Logical fallacies ,2024-07-30 01:28:44,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1efgxzr/logical_fallacies/,"Hi mods, remove this if you like, but I believe that this is helpful for people, especially on this thread. Obviously this isn‚Äôt directly related but it can definitely be helpful here considering how many people fall into these far too often. 



### STRAWMAN
Misrepresenting someone‚Äôs argument to make it easier to attack.
By exaggerating, misrepresenting, or just completely fabricating someone‚Äôs argument, it‚Äôs much easier to present your own position as being reasonable or valid. This kind of dishonesty serves to undermine rational debate.

### FALSE CAUSE
Presuming that a real or perceived relationship between things means that one is the cause of the other.
The two events might be coincidental or both might be caused by some other underlying factor, but that is assumed rather than investigated. Correlation does not equal causation.

### APPEAL TO EMOTION
Manipulating an emotional response in place of a valid or compelling argument.
Appeals to emotion include appeals to fear, envy, hatred, pity, pride, and more. They attempt to persuade by influencing feelings rather than by rational argument.

### THE FALLACY FALLACY
Presuming a claim to be necessarily wrong because a fallacy has been committed.
One may use a fallacious argument to arrive at a correct conclusion, so it is important to address whether the conclusion is correct in its own right rather than simply assuming it to be false due to the use of a fallacy.

### SLIPPERY SLOPE
Asserting that if we allow A to happen, then Z will consequently happen too, therefore A should not happen.
This is a kind of fear-mongering, which assumes a series of events without providing evidence that they will happen, often moving from small steps to a dramatic ending.

### AD HOMINEM
Attacking your opponent‚Äôs character or personal traits in an attempt to undermine their argument.
This includes name-calling, labelling, and making offensive or irrelevant personal comments rather than addressing the argument itself.

### TU QUOQUE

Avoiding having to engage with criticism by turning it back on the accuser - answering criticism with criticism.

### PERSONAL INCREDULITY 

Saying that because one finds something difficult to understand, it‚Äôs therefore not true.

### SPECIAL PLEADING
Moving the goalposts or making up exceptions when a claim is shown to be false.
This involves changing the criteria or conditions of the argument to suit your needs, rather than admitting the argument is flawed.

### LOADED QUESTION
Asking a question that has an assumption built into it so that it can‚Äôt be answered without appearing guilty.
Such questions are often used to trap the respondent into an admission of something they might not otherwise want to acknowledge.

### THE GAMBLER‚ÄôS FALLACY
Believing that ‚Äòruns‚Äô occur to statistically independent phenomena such as roulette wheel spins.
This fallacy arises from the mistaken belief that past events can affect the probability of something happening in the future, which is not true in independent events.

### BANDWAGON
Appealing to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation.
The assumption is that the opinion of the majority is always valid: which isn‚Äôt necessarily the case, as popularity does not equal correctness.

### APPEAL TO AUTHORITY
Saying that because an authority thinks something, it must therefore be true.
While it‚Äôs true that authoritative sources can be reliable, it‚Äôs also true that they can be wrong, and the authority must be considered alongside the evidence presented.

### COMPOSITION/DIVISION
Assuming that what‚Äôs true about one part of something has to be applied to all, or other, parts of it.
This can lead to faulty conclusions when the characteristics of the parts do not necessarily represent the characteristics of the whole, or vice versa.

### NO TRUE SCOTSMAN
Making what could be called an appeal to purity as a way to dismiss relevant criticisms or flaws of an argument.
By shifting the goalposts so that criticisms are excluded from consideration, this avoids addressing the actual argument.

## GENETIC 
Judging something good or bad on the basis do where it comes from, or from whom it comes from.

### BURDEN OF PROOF
Saying that the burden of proof lies not with the person making the claim, but with someone else to disprove.
This shifts the responsibility of providing evidence away from the one making the claim and can be used to avoid providing proof altogether.

### AMBIGUITY
Using double meanings or ambiguities of language to mislead or misrepresent the truth.
This can involve using euphemisms or ambiguous terms to create a false impression or to manipulate the interpretation of statements.

### BLACK-OR-WHITE
Where two alternative states are presented as the only possibilities, when in fact more possibilities exist.
This limits the range of options and makes the situation seem more dire or simplistic than it actually is.

### BEGGING THE QUESTION
A circular argument in which the conclusion is included in the premise.
The argument assumes the truth of what it is supposed to prove, rather than supporting it with evidence.

### APPEAL TO NATURE
Making the argument that because something is ‚Äònatural‚Äô it is therefore valid, justified, inevitable, good, or ideal.
This overlooks the complexity of what is considered natural and assumes that anything natural is inherently good, which is not always the case.

### ANECDOTAL
Using personal experience or an isolated example instead of a valid argument, especially to dismiss statistics.
While personal stories can be compelling, they are not sufficient evidence on their own and can lead to incorrect generalizations.

### THE TEXAS SHARPSHOOTER
Cherry-picking data clusters to suit an argument, or finding a pattern to fit a presumption.
This involves highlighting only the data that supports your argument while ignoring the data that contradicts it.

### MIDDLE GROUND
Saying that a compromise, or middle point, between two extremes must be the truth.
This assumes that the correct answer lies somewhere in the middle of two opposing arguments, which may not always be the case.

1ef4n9f,The Palestinian Authority needs to be fixed before statehood for long term success for a state,2024-07-29 16:58:26,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ef4n9f/the_palestinian_authority_needs_to_be_fixed/,"


I know many countries  are recognizing a Palestinian state and may mean well by recognizing Palestine as a state but I feel that there‚Äôs major issues regarding the government of the West Bank that should be fixed first before recognition otherwise that could lead to failure of a future Palestinian state and a peaceful two state solution. Obviously there‚Äôs issues with both Israel and the P.A. but the P.A is pushing for a state while Israel as an established state is more recognized already.


  People talk about Hamas ruling and no elections but the Palestinian Authority hasn‚Äôt had elections since 2005 either.  They‚Äôve had several presidents but it‚Äôs the prime minister who truly controls things. The head of the Palestinian Authority Prime minister Abass was voted into office indefinitely by the PLO Central Council in 2009. And Abbas cancelled planned elections in 2021 as well. The only reason I see for why he‚Äôd do that is if he fears he‚Äôd lose.And that was before what‚Äôs going on with Gaza and Hamas‚Äôs rising support  according to poles which is also troubling .The first parliamentary  elections planned in 15 years he canceled whatever his reasons . Critics of the government are punished and jailed or worse. Nizar Banat an outspoken critic of the PA who criticized Abbas for cancelling elections was beaten to death by a squad of PA security forces, who arrested him from his home in the middle of the night on camera. There‚Äôs video of security forces carrying his seemingly lifeless body  afterwards .Recent polling suggests that  90% of Palestinians in the West Bank want Abbasgone .


And then there‚Äôs territory . They also don‚Äôt currently govern or control the proposed Palestinian state as Hamas controls Gaza. They don‚Äôt govern or control the territory  of the proposed state. That‚Äôs a factor as to why Taiwans government went from being recognized as China to the communist government being recognized.Now with what‚Äôs happening in Gaza it might be possible for them to do so afterwards . But I don‚Äôt think giving the PA  authority of Gaza after would work well. It wouldn‚Äôt be seen as the people of Gaza supported them and they pushed Hamas out like it could‚Äôve been when they fight fought if they had won but that they came in after Israel and scooped up the Gaza . As even if Hamas is beaten to a point it doesn‚Äôt govern Gaza it won‚Äôt be seen as the PA defeating Hamas or even the PA stopping Israel giving them that authority.Abbas himself has supported Israel‚Äôs blockade of Gaza to hurt Hamas before . He also supported Israel‚Äôs blockading of Gaza as a way to hurt Hamas. He had already put pressure on Hamas by withholding the Israeli fuel that until two weeks ago powered Gaza‚Äôs only generating plant, and slashing the salaries of the 60,000 civil servants in Gaza by 30% who are one of the mainstays of the economy in Gaza .The PA also decided to stop paying Israel for electricity that it supplied Gaza in 2017 that wasn‚Äôt reversed until 2018. Abbas also supported Israel‚Äôs blockade of Gaza . I can‚Äôt see how Palestinians in Gaza would support a Palestinian leader who supported the blockade and who cut off their electricity to hurt Hamas.


     That also doesn‚Äôt take into account the insane corruption levels of the PA . Their major corruption issues are a major reason they lost the election to Hamas all those years ago.  The security forces is extremely bloated with  each officer assigned to lieutenant colonel or above there are two soldiers. In Israel, the ratio is 9 soldiers to one officer, and in the U.S. it is 5 to one. In 2016, reached the salaries for such officers was 238.7 million NIS per year, equivalent to the yearly salary of 13000 soldiers. Theres payment to non existent companies. Palestinian treasury paid salaries to hundreds of employees in the ‚ÄòPalestinian Airlines‚Äô, which is a governmental company that has a board of directors, headed by the Minister of Transportation. But there is no airline that exists on the ground and the budget for this ‚Äòcompany‚Äô is included in the budget of the Ministry of Transport and Transportation with no details.  His sons have major corruption issues with monopolies on public work projects and USAAid funding. As part of the 2016 Panama Papers data leak, it was revealed that Abbas's son Tareq Abbas holds US$1 million in shares of an offshore company associated with the Palestinian Authority . Abass also built a giant presidential palace ‚Äî50,000 square feet for the Palace itself plus another 40,000 in other buildings‚Äîcost the bankrupt Palestinian Authority $17.5 million . It‚Äôs not just Abass and his sons stealing millions. Palestinian businessmen are threatened by PLO leaders to sell land.Saleem Nawati had leukemia and lived in Gaza. Obviously he needed better medical care and to leave Gaza. He had to wait weeks for Israel to get a permit but he did. It was the PLOthat caused the issues. The government run hospitals don‚Äôt have specialized cancer treatment so the PA incurs high bills from private hospitals or travelers. Saleem died of his cancer and he couldn‚Äôt be admitted because the PA didn‚Äôt pay its debts. Businessmen and Philanthropists donated 10 million dollars to  build a specialized cancer hospital near Ramallah but the site is still an empty pile of land and in January the  project was frozen due to lack of funds. The prime  minister said the donated funds were put in a bank account but provided no proof.


 It‚Äôs the system.Arafat ruled the Palestinians for decades and died a billionaire . Their insane corruption issues resulted in them losing the election to Hamas before and it likely has gotten worse. If those aren‚Äôt fixed then any aid or money given to a future Palestinain state will be stolen. There‚Äôs no blockade in the West Bank but millions are stolen by the Palestinain Authority still. What good does having a state do for Palestinians in the West Bank  if they‚Äôre not free to make decisions in it or vote . 




If you put the PA in charge but it still is a corrupt government, without free elections ,and unpopular by the people that‚Äôs a recipe for disaster even if you strengthen them. Sadly I believe that far too many of the resources will be ruined by corruption and failures of government and even if they do take over its issues risk Hamas or another group like it coming to power. The PA must fix its issues otherwise that risk any effective future governance. I mean just look at Afghanistan . The U.S. spent billions in Afghanistan on its government and military but the minute it left the Taliban took over. 


So putting them in charge of Gaza could easily result in Hamas or another group like them taking power again. Also I worry that Hamas not them might get the credit for the recognition of a Palestinian state right now.None of those countries recognized a Palestinian state in all those years but doing so now clearly shows it‚Äôs due to the suffering of those in Gaza and to make a statement regarding that.I fear hamas could attempt to paint the picture that their actions resulted in this because nothing major has changed regarding the PA in terms of governing or making deals with Israel recently on their own that they could point to that I know of to claim that recognition and not risk Hamas getting it.Maybe if the PA had played a role in taking down Hamas or more so in helping Palestinians in Gaza in some way or even making some ground with Israel in regards to peace agreements maybe getting hostages back or maybe make some ground regarding stopping the settlements in the West Bank for Palestinians they could point to and say we did this for you more directly I would feel better . But as it is now they aren‚Äôt popular nor have much public support .



I fear that creating a Palestinian state with the PA in charge with its issues as it is now  has could result in a failed state. Some countries believe that giving state recognition will give the PA something and give them resources to be on more even footing with Israel from an international level. That‚Äôs quite possible but at the same time you can‚Äôt build a successful state with a corrupt authoritarian regime like the PA as the foundation. If you have a corrupt state and give it money without fixing those issues those resources won‚Äôt got to the people .That I fear will result in a failed state and chaos. Though having a successful state doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll always have recognition . Somalia is a corrupt failed state. There‚Äôs ethnic violence , corruption, food and  sanitation  insecurity, ministers who were part of Al-Shabab,attacks on journalists and civilians, displacement of aid, sexual violence and more.  Its economic problems resulted in pirates which even got their own movie . 

Somaliland in the north isn‚Äôt recognized despite it having free and fair elections with transitions of power , its own currency, no terrorist activity since 2008,its own military and is stable though still poor. It does have some problems and  issues it clearly needs to solve but seems more stable than Somalia the recognized country .


Israel is obviously a factor and there‚Äôs issues dealing with the P.A. and Israel but that‚Äôs separate . The issues I stated like corruption, cancelling elections,lack of freedom to protest or voice opinions are all actions taken independently by the Palestinians own government.My point is giving the Palestinians a government that can actually run a state, provide security and stability and not one that steals from them, prevents opposition ,cancels elections and more is needed. I think it would be easier for long term for Palestinians to build a state with a government that‚Äôs for the Palestinian people as a foundation instead of building a state with the PA as it is as a base. If you want to build a building you don‚Äôt start with a bad foundation but something that can last and hold up. Regardless I hope for a future peace in these dark times for both Israelis and Palestinians."
1ef4b3r,A Proposed Solution: Lebanon Sells South Lebanon to Palestine ,2024-07-29 16:44:43,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ef4b3r/a_proposed_solution_lebanon_sells_south_lebanon/,"Hello,

This is what I've proposed in work I've published: Lebanon sells South Lebanon to Palestine, and the West Bank is linked to SL through the Golan Heights, and/or a Jordanian/Syrian passage. 

This would form a crescent shaped country of Palestine in the Near East. Palestine gets a new country, with perhaps Sidon as a Mediterranean sea port, and a government. Lebanon gets an unconditional cash bailout, and Israel gets a satisfactory amount of land. 

Hezbollah becomes Palestinines new military, and a new DMZ is constructed along the border, with hypersonic missiles pointed down Hezbollahs throats. 

Gaza becomes a city state, and Israel continues its push to destroy, and/or drive out Hamas. They install a safe zone border where they vet unarmed Gazans to live safely north of the moving border, while they push the border south, until Hamas is removed from Gaza, and a new governing body takes its place. 

No, this would not mean an end to conflicts. That's what the missiles are for. But offering Hezbollah leadership in a new Palestine could be sufficient incentive to normalize relations. And then Lebanon would have a buffer country in Palestine, rather than always being dragged into conflicts with Israel. 

As far as why Lebanon may go for it: because they won't have a choice. I'm not 100% on Lebanons status right now, but I'm pretty sure they're still more or less stalled at the point of not being willing to make necessary reforms to get a bail out. So an unconditional cash land sale could be their best chance at buying time to avoid a forced removal, because at a certain point, there's not going to be anything to protect them. "
1ef1yt8,"Critics of Israel, what‚Äôs your solution to the conflict?",2024-07-29 15:10:27,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ef1yt8/critics_of_israel_whats_your_solution_to_the/,"I‚Äôve noticed that critics of Israel almost never want to talk about what they think the ultimate solution is to the conflict in Gaza. 

I‚Äôve heard some suggest mass deportation of all Israelis from the entire region, but obviously this will never happen and really makes no sense at all. Clearly the vast majority of the citizens of Israel would never be willing to do this. It‚Äôs also a morally reprehensible solution considering Jews have a legitimate cultural stake to the region. 

Migration of gaza citizens clearly wouldn‚Äôt work considering no other country is willing to take them in. There is an argument to be made that they also have a cultural stake to the region. 

I think that the population of Gaza is one of the most violent and radicalized groups of people in the world, with the vast majority of them supporting Hamas and supporting 10/7 according to all available polling data. This is would explain why no countries in the world including pro-Islam, anti-Israel neighbors such as Egypt, refuse to take any Gaza citizens in. 

I think everyone agrees simply returning to the same state of operations prior to 10/7 would be a terrible idea and lead to a continuation of the same thing we‚Äôre seeing right now. 

In my opinion, the solution is for Israel to implement forced de-radicalization of Gaza akin to the de-nazification strategies that were used in post ww2 Germany. That means Israel will need to take full control of Gaza and strictly enforce a ban of all pro-Hamas or pro-violence sentiments, eliminate all weapons from the area, seal all tunnels, ban public assembly, etc. 

But I want to hear some Israel-critical opinions. "
1eerbrd,The Rafah ground invasion has been a success,2024-07-29 05:05:05,120,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eerbrd/the_rafah_ground_invasion_has_been_a_success/,"Remember the [#AllEyesOnRafah a few months ago with the AI art](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/30/world/all-eyes-on-rafah-image-ai-cec/index.html)? How the entire world was saying that it would be a disaster if Israel went into Rafah? How all the American talking heads were saying that there would be massive casualties? 

They were all wrong. Every single person who shared that hashtag was wrong. All 50 million of them. The Biden administration was also wrong to restrict military shipments to prevent a Rafah ground invasion, and I maintain that this has been one of the most insulting policy blunders by far in this war. 

[Israel's Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, in an interview with WSJ says](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-israel-turned-the-tide-in-rafah-hamas-pressure-to-make-deal-d5baa104?utm_source=Klaviyo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=daily-newsletter-paid&utm_content=06-18-24&_kx=BneFieUuam0m6BoehcgWIzaiLf3qA5qf_OvFQ9SPQj0.L87CGh): 

>Why, after months of contemptuous stalling, did Hamas begin to bend?

>‚ÄúTwo reasons,‚Äù says Israel Katz, Israel‚Äôs foreign minister, in an interview at the Journal‚Äôs office. ‚ÄúOne, they understand now that there will be no cease-fire without a hostage deal. Two, the IDF is acting aggressively against the terrorists in Gaza. Especially important was entering Rafah,‚Äù Hamas‚Äôs stronghold at the southern end of the strip.

>Israel cut off Hamas‚Äôs supply routes and now holds Hamas ‚Äúby the throat,‚Äù as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently put it. Senior terrorists are dropping at a faster clip as Israeli intelligence closes in; half of Hamas‚Äôs military leadership has been eliminated. Even after a large Israeli bombardment to kill Hamas‚Äôs military chief, Mohammed Deif, who is considered unlikely to have survived, Hamas barely attacked in response and rushed to clarify that it isn‚Äôt leaving negotiations. ‚ÄúHamas is under much more pressure now,‚Äù Mr. Katz says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what made the difference.‚Äù

>Israeli intelligence confirms it. **‚ÄúWe see now the signs that there is a lot of pressure from the military arm of Hamas. They push the leaders in the hotels outside‚Äù‚ÄîHamas‚Äôs politicians, who live in luxury in Qatar‚Äî‚Äúto achieve an agreement. It wasn‚Äôt like that before,‚Äù Mr. Katz says. Hamas‚Äôs leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want a deal before. Not even when we offered everything.‚Äù**

>**It shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise that pressure on Hamas could yield gains in negotiations.** Yet for months Western powers took the opposite approach, pressuring Israel to end the war and leave Hamas victorious. They called for an ‚Äúimmediate cease-fire,‚Äù increasingly delinked from a hostage deal. Humanitarian groups upbraided Israel and kept quiet about Hamas. The International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court menaced Israel with bogus prosecutions and tribunals.

>‚ÄúThe main reason that this murderer, Sinwar, didn‚Äôt do the hostage deal is because he expected the world to stop Israel without it,‚Äù says Mr. Katz. ‚ÄúHe expected the ICJ, the ICC, the Security Council, maybe a conflict between the United Nations, Israel and the EU‚Äù‚Äîsurely one of them would force Israel to capitulate. Time was on Hamas‚Äôs side, no matter how many hostages it kept or killed.

In other words, there was no need to come to a ceasefire prior to the Rafah invasion. There was absolutely no need to capitulate to Hamas and let them rebuild. If you were reading sources like [Tablet](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/israel-middle-east/articles/israel-succeeding-gaza) or [John Spencer](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/israel-has-created-a-new-standard-for-urban-warfare-why-will-no-one-admit-it-opinion/ar-BB1kw2Wf) , and not paying attention to the mainstream media, you would have known that the IDF was kicking Hamas' butt. 

Hamas has been severely crippled. The [IDF now has vast amounts of intelligence on them](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-811143), their tunnels are destroyed, their battalions are defeated. The only things that are left is to ensure that Hamas doesn't govern the day after and the remaining hostages are released. 

[The Jerusalem Post also reports: ](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-811517)

>**Hamas's military wing no longer operates in large formations and has shifted to guerrilla warfare. The working assumption on the ground is that Hamas can plan attacks but currently prefers not to fight, thus retreating from any place the IDF reaches.**

>**It is assessed that Hamas's retreat policy is due to the loss of experienced operatives and commanders and a shortage of weapons. Hamas's equipment shortage is so severe that they recently started using ""reverse"" cameras taken from vehicles as security cameras.** The organization has also begun booby-trapping water tanks to harm IDF soldiers scanning the area.

This is pretty much a major, major success for Israel. 

What I hope to see from the rest of the world is an apology, maybe even some self reflection that they shouldn't be so quick to condemn Israel. There is no need for political sanctions, and it is insulting to assume the IDF doesn't know what they are doing. The IDF continues to be an effective, professional army that is accomplishing their military objectives. 

I sincerely doubt that the world will give an apology and I fully expect to be called a propagandist or a bot, but the WSJ interview should be indicative that what the mainstream media are telling people and what the reality is are two different things. 

As the war against Hamas wraps up, and hopefully all the remaining hostages are released, Israel can fully turn their attention to Hezbollah. Since it's much easier to fight a war on one front than two (much less seven!), Israel would not be as bogged down.

Having done away with the failed COIN tactics seen in Iraq/Afghanistan, Israel's new tactics will probably be studied for decades to come. "
1eekbck,Questions for Israelis ,2024-07-28 23:00:38,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1eekbck/questions_for_israelis/,"
I wanted to Israelis both political and non political questions

1) are Israelis really that rude as people say? 

I never experienced Israeli tourists but I spoke to one who sells skin care and she was nice. My dad and I knew she was Israeli from the accent and we asked and she said, and she asked if my dad was Jewish and he said and he said he‚Äôs heartbroken over October 7th and hopes Israel gets rid of Hamas and she smiled and said thanks. On the other hand, I heard horror stories of rude Israelis, entitled, not cleaning up after themselves from many people. How true is this?

2) what is the education system like? I hear stories online about how they‚Äôre taught to hate Arabs that seems like a clip from a religious school and most Israelis aren‚Äôt taught this 

3) what about Israeli society would you change? 

4) what do you eat during Hanukkah or Passover or in general? I hear racist people assume Israelis eat bagels and lox when that‚Äôs more American Jewish food. 

5) would you serve in the idf if it was optional? 

I heard some Israelis say that the idf training is hard and they hated it a lot. 

6) if you‚Äôre a Palestinian living in Israel how do you like living there? 

7) how do you feel about Arabs saying they feel disconnected from Israel and Palestine. The national anthem of Israel being centered around Jewish identity and Judaism while feel alienated from Palestinians elsewhere because they‚Äôre Israeli citizens and don‚Äôt fit in



I always wanted to ask these questions especially the rudeness since it‚Äôs a common enough compliant that I figured it could be true or mistaking how blunt Israelis are for rudeness. The not cleaning up and bad table manners is a common complaint that I can‚Äôt rationalize. I‚Äôm lucky in my experience the Israelis I met in person were friendly and online the men are nice. I just noticed they were blunt and argumentative if you disagreed with them. One guy asked me a question nicely then would get aggressive if I didn‚Äôt agree and pushed back slightly in a nice way.

Islamists, Hamasniks and the pro Palestinian movement at large, which are all inherently anti semitic, prop up heretical Jews in the guise of mainstream Jews. This is meant to fool the western world to bolster the lie that ‚Äúanti Zionism is not anti semitism‚Äù since ‚Äúsome ‚ÄòJews‚Äô agree‚Äù. 

These people do not represent Judaism or any mainstream political Jewish political movements. It‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hate all Americans, just the ones who aren‚Äôt in antifa‚Äù. Or during ancient times when there were fringe Christian groups, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hate all Christians, just the ones that aren‚Äôt gnostics‚Äù. Really what people are saying is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hate all Jews, just the ones who aren‚Äôt traitors to their religion and their people‚Äù. Which by the way is a vast minority of actual Jews. 

Naturei karta and Jewish voice for peace are fringe political groups and Jewish heretics. And their viewpoints are completely antithetical to Jewish religious doctrine and mainstream Jewish organizations.  In fact to allege they do represent the Jewish people is a vicious anti semitism that needs to be called out, because the terrorist supporters who knowingly perpetrate the lie *know* that it deeply offends Jews when they do.

I am pro civilians.
I would like to start by saying it is an unimaginable tragedy, I am sad and grieving for the families of the children.
In this post I want to start a conversation about grieving in this war. One of the most unfortunate things I see in this war is the flattening discussion that makes people believe that grieving people on a certain side is littling the grieving of the other. What made me start writing is seeing a post on twitter grieving these children and the comments were flooded with ""imagine how the Gazans feel"". I grieve and am heartbroken for the Gazan children, women and civilians who were killed or hurt by this war. Why did we reduce the discussion on this war to picking sides? Why can't we grieve both sides? If a post or an article is talking about Gazan people who died there is no reason for the comments to be ""what about the Israeli people"". One side's grief should not and does not affect the grieving of the other. If a post or an article is talking about deaths of Israelis, immediately interrupting it with the tragedies happening in Gaza does not help the movement. As civilians, we should and need to let people be heartbroken for their people. Expecting people, especially Israelis, ESPECIALLY people who knew the people who died to immediately move on and fight for the other side, is cruel and unfair. 
Letting innocent civilians grieve is only humane.
On both sides, always. It will never hurt your movement, no matter what military opinions you hold. Our grieving does not little yours. My wish is for us to come together and cry for all the innocent, wonderful humans we lost."

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB3uwVqGVI0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB3uwVqGVI0)

Apparently thousands of Israeli Druze (non-Muslim non-Jewish Arab) citizens now serve in the Israel Defense Forces. Not defenseless against Hezbollah at all. The following is from 2015 in the IDF website to announce the Herev Battalion integrating into the IDF‚Äôs forces:

>**The End of One Legacy and the Beginning of Another: A Final Salute to the Herev Battalion**

>After decades of only serving alongside fellow community members, the Druze soldiers of the Herev Battalion will begin integrating into the rest of the IDF‚Äôs forces. On May 18th, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eizenkot officially announced the closing of the Druze-only battalion in response to the minority community‚Äôs interest in sending their young, brave men to serve in combat roles across all IDF units. The Druze make up one of Israel‚Äôs largest minority groups, comprising of more than 100,000 people.

>The Herev Battalion has distinguished itself since its establishment as a leading and significant force in the IDF‚Äôs infantry units. It has been awarded with two citations over the years: one from the GOC of the Southern Command for taking down an Egyptian intelligence unit in the Negev and another for its operational activities in the Second Lebanon War.

I expect they will be conducting missions against Hezbollah, in Lebanon and Syria. Not helplessly watching southern Jewish guys who don't as well know the landscape possibly miss the target.

They already have a reputation of not messing around when terrorists turn their otherwise peaceful (north Israel not south where Gaza is) Golan Heights communities into a battlefield. Squabbles over a name on a map are minor in comparison to what makes them thankful to live in Israel and proud to have enlisted/integrated into the IDF.

Link to the official announcement of this being the last straw and plan a response in alliance with the Druze, before Hezbollah takes control of Lebanon, where life-loving Lebanese stay away from areas they seized and will not miss them when gone is:

A one minute video summary of the invaders of Lebanon and northern Israel who next want to destroy the USA is:

[Behind the Flag of Hezbollah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIkBCpnyHiQ)

Golan Heights proved to be the opposite of Gaza. Lebanese Druze can in turn be hopeful Israeli Druze will soon make it safe to travel through the Hezbollah occupied launch complexes again, also hope they don't miss any.

How united the Israeli Druze are is indicated by this text below from their (spiritual and) political representative in Israeli government, who is trusted by the people to speak for them in these matters. They all together have power in the Israeli government and IDF level that makes it easy to make the best of their citizenship. Through the IDF they're also allied with the USA and NATO to help keep Putin away too. Now that you know this you'll better understand why they genuinely have reason to be proud ""citizens of a democratic state and respect its laws"" with the power to help their people in Lebanon and Syria rid itself of Hezbollah.

>In response to a letter sent by Lebanese Druze leader¬†Walid Jumblatt¬†earlier this week,¬†Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif,¬†the spiritual leader of the Druze in Israel,¬†told Jumblatt to stop acting to please certain ‚Äòactors,‚Äô subtly hinting at Hezbollah.

>Tarif added that the¬†**Druze in Israel are citizens of a democratic state and respect its laws.** He further hoped that Jumblatt would **respect the views of Israeli Druze just as the Druze in Israel respect those of the Druze in Lebanon.**

>Concerning Jumblatt‚Äôs accusation of cowardice, Tarif responded:¬†‚Äú**We live in freedom and respect in this country, and we are not afraid or intimidated by any human being. We do not hesitate to take any position in the interest of the (Druze) sect‚Ä¶ The Druze community in the country has representatives in Parliament and heads of councils and municipalities who carry out the political duty required of them towards the community and its rights, without hesitation or fear.**‚Äù

>Finally,¬†regarding Tarif‚Äôs ¬†**meeting with Netanyahu**, denounced by Jumblatt, Tarif explained:¬†‚Äú**In our customs we receive and respect those who visit us for the benefit of the (Druze) sect and its rights, regardless of who they are. We do not change our customs, which are a trust that we must always maintain.**‚Äù

Their politically active leaders were all along demanding, to make the state of ""Israel"" prove its sincerity by fully accepting them. Now it's like ""the Jews"" to the south all became their unexpected fan club, who want to see them become legend again. This time with fighter jets and whatever else they already know how to control.

What is happening in the south in and around Gaza is what happens if Hezbollah takes full control of the culture and infrastructure of the Golan Heights. But now the people are well represented in the IDF, instead of stuck digging tunnels and such for Hezbollah. Having no Jews to blame this time and not being Muslims either makes the internet routine of honoring the kids as martyrs look more insane. Blaming ""Israel"" for what Israelis do in the north only works in certain places on social media, not reality, now very much against Hezbollah after crossing their line.

Where words fail to express what happened since 2015, in the Golan Heights, it's necessary to in their honor dedicate what they earned by now being a part of, which is:
